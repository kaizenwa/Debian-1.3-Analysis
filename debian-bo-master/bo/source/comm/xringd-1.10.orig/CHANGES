	- a bug still lurked: need to reopen tty if a program like pppd
	  closes and hangs up the same line. -HUP now reopens the device.
	  You need to send a HUP signal to xringd when pppd closes. This
	  is not great but I can only think of a kernel change for this
	  now and I want to avoid it...
	- released 1.10

* 28/02/96 (ah)
	- more testing
	- very minor changes
	- released 1.00

* 17/02/96 (ah)
	- can now add command line options in the config file
	- SIGHUP now also re-reads the config file
	- logging (except ringsm_dump) now done by a callback into xringd.c
	  so it can appear via syslog
	- added compilation check for Linux and kernel > 1.3.48
	- released 0.96

* 13/02/96 (ah)
	- signal mask restored on spawned children
	- tested ok on getty/fax + xringd + dialout-ppp setups
	- added a max wait timeout between events (when no final scheduled)
	- released 0.95

* 24/01/96 (ah)
	- found the problem with EIO returned to ioctl (only with ppp or
	  ldisc changers (?); after they close they set the line hung).
	- suggested a kernel change to tytso.
	- added a close and reopen on the modem device when EIO received
	  for a quick temp fix (may introduce other probs? - my testing did not)
	- released 0.90

* 19/01/96 (ah)
	- hopefully some bugs are gone.
	- released 0.8

	- Added -l loglevel
	- More logging
