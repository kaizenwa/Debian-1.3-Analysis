New User Add-On for aD! BBS 1.3
(c) 1995, 1996 Chris Church / aD! Data Systems.

This package is just an example of how to allow users to apply for accounts
voer telnet or dial-up.  Look at the addacct script and adjust to your
needs, then add it to your crontab, e.g.:

root# crontab -e

put in the following line:

59 * * * *  /usr/local/bin/addacct 2>/tmp/addacct.ll

and it will run every 59 minutes past the hour.
