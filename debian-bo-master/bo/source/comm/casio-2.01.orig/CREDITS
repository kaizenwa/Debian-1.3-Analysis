Credit goes to the following individuals; If i have forgotten
anyone please let me know so that i can add you to the list.

1)  protocol posted somewhere on the net by Knut Radloff <knut@krhh.hanse.de>
    (and a lot of other detailed useful pieces of info)
 
2)  L. Muhlenberg  for the original implementation on DOS
 
3)  Victor Wiewirowski (wwiewior@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca) 
    for setting up the casio info on his web page
    [http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/u/wwiewior/CASIO/]

    would have been much difficult.
