------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------
Sun Apr 28 15:00:00  1996
-------------------------

	released getty 2.0.7i

	Modified by Jeff Chua (jchua@fedex.com)
	uugetty sometimes hangs while trying to open() a modem port.
	The last line from /usr/adm/debug will look like ...
		"... D_INIT: opening line /dev/ttyS1"
	Modified so that failure to open the "tty" after 3 attempts will
	terminate the program so that init can restart another uugetty,
	rather than hanging forever!


-------------------------
Tue May 17 01:25:09  1994
-------------------------
	released getty 2.0.7d
	full source release
	available at tsx-11.mit.edu and sunsite.unc.edu

Reported Problems with previous release:
	none worth mentioning

Changes for this release:
	cleaned up SCHED code a bit, other minor cleanups
	added a macro for alarm() and signal() that produces 
	  debugging output each time these are called
	added proper support for FIDO calls

Plans for Next Major Release (2.0.8):
	more major code cleanups
	Fax receive
	major rewrite of chat sequence handling to facilitate 
	  creeping featurism
	Callback [not ringback] support
	major rewrite of defaults file and gettydefs file processing
	utmp/wtmp logging of fax receives and fido calls
	proper ownerships and modes for tty lines (configurable?)

-------------------------
Sun Mar 13 12:53:24  1994
-------------------------
	released getty 2.0.7d-beta
	full source release, as well as diffs against 2.0.7d-alpha
	available at boulder.colorado.edu:/pub/linux/getty_ps
	released to mailing list for testing only

Reported Problems with previous release:
	vhangup() and controlling tty code still not quite correct
	second open should not have been retried on EAGAIN
	variable substitutions of '@c' produce nothing when 'c' is
	  not a recognized variable
	utmp logging broken for users of simpleinit
	logging via syslog cordumped
	dprint() not working

Changes for this release:
	fixed vhangup() and controlling tty code -- hopefully for
	  the last time
	changed handling of '@c' variable substitutions so that if
	  'c' is not recognized, @c is just passed through as is
	exit if second open() returns EAGAIN
	correct unified handling of utmp regardless of the init 
	  program being used
	changed all instances of 'connect' to 'Connect' ... this was
	  causing syslog() to coredump (the dynamic linker seems to
	  replace the connect system call with the global variable
	  connect).
	fixed dprint() (twice) to allocate its buffer in static 
	  memory so that I can return a pointer to it without it
	  disappearing
	added signal handlers for QUIT, TERM, and SEGV to produce
	  logging output
	cleaned up the Makefile a little bit (make depend works now,
	  and make lint is gone)
	a few minor code cleanups

Plans for Next Minor Release (2.0.7d):
	Possibly incorporate FIDO patches into the source
	There may be other unknown bugs
	Update ducumentation to reflect new options

Plans for Next Major Release (2.0.8):
	more major code cleanups
	Fax receive
	FIDO calls implemented correctly
	major rewrite of chat sequence handling to facilitate 
	  creeping featurism
	Callback [not ringback] support
	major rewrite of defaults file and gettydefs file processing
	utmp/wtmp logging of fax receives and fido calls
	proper ownerships and modes for tty lines (configurable?)

	full source release
	available at boulder.colorado.edu:/pub/linux/getty_ps

	incompatibility with 0.99.15 and higher kernels

	  syslog support
	more verbose logerr() output:
	  added strerror(errno) to many logerr calls
	  syslog support

	  line correctly opened, and vhangup()'d
	  initial termios settings set correctly
	  process group & controlling terminal correctly established
	  EAGAIN return from open() handled correctly
	bug fixes:
	  wtmp file is locked before writing to prevent corruption

	  a few debug() calls do not do the right thing

Plans for Next Major Release (2.0.8):
	more major code cleanups

	  such as:  WAITFOR used without INITLINE
		    RINGBACK used without WAITFOR
		    arguments in the wrong order (speed, tty)

-------------------------
Fri Apr 2  23:00:00  1993
-------------------------
	completed getty 2.0.7 alpha
	(no public release)

Reported Problems with previous release:
	getty/uugetty:
	  still problems with job control on tty 1; a result of
	  an incompatibility with sysvinit.  flickering DTR with
	  uugetty.

Changes for this release:
	getty/uugetty:
	  totally reworked main.c, added uufuncs.c, main.h, uufuncs.h
	  in order to clean up the source code.  Added INITLINE so that
	  line initialization can be done over a separate device.
	  reincorporated support for the WAITFOR option.
	uugetty:
	  fork off a child to watch for lockfiles instead of using
	  alarm clocks, so that DTR is not disturbed (only if WAITFOR
	  is not used)

Plans for next release:
	getty/uugetty:
	  apply the ringback patches (by hand), and the various other
	  patches.
	Documentation:
	  move all of (4) to (5) to match the Linux manual scheme.
