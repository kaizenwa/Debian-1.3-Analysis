		Announcing minicom 1.73

Minicom is a communications program that resembles the MSDOS Telix
somewhat. It has a dialing directory, color, full ANSI and VT100
emulation, an (external) scripting language and more.

Minicom 1.71 has no major new features but is a mere "bug-fix release".
There was a security hole in the code that reads the configuration
files. This has been fixed.
