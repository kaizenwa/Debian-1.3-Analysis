                Porting minicom to different platforms.
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Minicom can easily be ported to many different flavors of UNIX(tm).
This takes an experienced C hacker though who knows a lot about the
internals of the specific system.

The files you need to adjust are:

1. Makefile.
   This is obvious: you need to add your CFLAGS, C compiler, etc.
2. port.h
   Here are all the relevant include files included. Also some defines
   are made for constants the target system does not have etc. This is
   a general file: don't put minicom dependant stuff in it.
   For example, if your system does not have uid_t, add a conditional
   define here.
3. sysdep1.c, sysdep2.c
   Here are the OS dependant routines hidden. This is mostly the
   terminal stuff, though 1 or 2 others (wait et al) are here too.
   This is the most non-trivial part, and it's directly connected to:
4. sysdep.h
   This file is only included in sysdep1.c and sysdep2.c. The same points
   are valid here as for (2).

There are a few defines in the other files too, but they are mainly for
old and/or obsolete systems (Minix 1.5, Coherent 3.2). For newer systems
it should not be nessecary to touch the other files.

A short overview of the #defines that define the behaviour of "port.h"
and "sysdep.h":

-D_POSIX_SOURCE		Assumes you have a Posix (alike) system.
-D_NO_TERMIOS		Even though you are Posix, there is no <termios.h>.
			For sysv, <termio.h> is used instead and for BSD etc
			<sgtty.h> is used.
-D_SELECT		Your system has the select() call.
-D_SYSV			You are on a sysv system (generic)
-D_SVR2			System V release 2 (also needs -D_SYSV)
-D_SYSV3		System V Release 3 (also needs -D_SYSV)
-D_BSD43		You are on a BSD 4.3 system
-D_COHERENT		It's a Coherent system (both 3.x and 4.x)
-D_COH3			Coherent 3.x
-D_COH4			Coherent 4.x
-D_HPUX_SOURCE		To compile on HPUX systems.
-D_ISC			You are on a system V.3 ISC system.
-D_SCO			For SCO unix 3.2 2 i386
-D_DGUX_SOURCE		For Data General Unix.
-D_HAVE_MACROS		Want macros to be sent when F1 thru F10 pressed
-DMAC_LEN		Want macros max length to be this 
			(ex. -DMAC_LEN=4096)

A mix of all the defines is needed to get minicom to compile. By looking at
the Makefile, you can probably figure out what you need.
