		Announcing minicom 1.70

Minicom is a communications program that resembles the MSDOS Telix
somewhat. It has a dialing directory, color, full ANSI and VT100
emulation, an (external) scripting language and more.

Minicom 1.71 has no major new features but is a mere "bug-fix release".
There now is a configurable history buffer size. The colors are saved
in the global configuration file if you're root. The dialing directory
is no longer deleted if it is (or seems) garbled. There is a '-M' flag
for 8th-bit-metakeys.
