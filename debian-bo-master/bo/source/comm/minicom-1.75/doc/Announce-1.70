		Announcing minicom 1.70

A short summary of what minicom is:

Minicom is a DOS (he said Jehowa!) style communications program much
like "Telix". It is full-screen menu driven, has a dialing
directory, supports color, VT102/VT220 and ANSI-BBS emulation,
multiple (per-user and per-port) configuration, x/y/z modem
protocols (external) etc.

Tested platforms:
Linux 1.1.90, SunOS 4.1.3, SCO ODT 3.2

Supported but untested (maybe needs a little tweaking):
DGUX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Coherent, HP/UX, SysVR4, Apollo Domain/OS.

New in minicom 1.70:

o Incorporated the macros and color patches of filip@alpha.med.pitt.edu.
  You can now customize the colors minicom uses. And, you can now program
  F1-F10 to send arbitrary strings to the remote host. I am planning
  to extend this to be able to control minicom itself, but that will
  probably be in the next version.
o Fixed ANSI characterset emulation (hosed it in 1.60). Better VT102
  emulation, TAB setting, insert mode, origin mode etc. added.
o VT emulation now passes the famous "vttest" program completely.
o Oops.. also hosed VT102 character maps. Now OK again, I can run minicom
  inside minicom and still get correct character sets.
o Minicom can use the status line of a terminal for it's own status line.
o The windows library can use the alternative character set of a terminal,
  so that you have menus in _real_ boxes on eg a vt320 terminal.
o Includes termcap entries for the Linux console, vt100, vt320 and
  xterm terminals that are _correct_ and _complete_.
o Added delays in "runscript" because it was too fast for some systems.
o Stores screen into scroll back buffer on clear screen
o Fixed lots of little bugs and problems (like the wrong entry that
  got deleted from the taglist in the dialing directory).
o Dial strings and script names now 31 characters max.
