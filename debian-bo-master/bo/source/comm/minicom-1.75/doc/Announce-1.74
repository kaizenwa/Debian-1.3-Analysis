		Announcing minicom 1.74

Minicom is a communications program that resembles the MSDOS Telix
somewhat. It has a dialing directory, color, full ANSI and VT100
emulation, an (external) scripting language and more.

Minicom 1.74 has no major new features but is a mere "bug-fix release".
There was a security hole in the code that reads the configuration
files. This has been fixed.

There was a 1.73 version for a short while but it has a subtle
bug in the configuration file read and write routines.
