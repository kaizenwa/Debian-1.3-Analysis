This program is an add-on to the vbox package, which uses the audio functions
of an ISDN card to use your Linux box as an answering machine.
xvboxled shows the number of new messages in the vbox incoming dir
as a 7-segment led display on the X desktop. It looks particularly cool
if you place it into the GoodStuff button bar of the fvwm window manager
(using a command like "*GoodStuff - NULL Swallow "xvboxled" xvboxled &").
It is free software, so it can be copied and modified at will.

To compile it, copy example-config.h to config.h and edit the #defines 
to customize the builtin defaults (you will probably want to at least edit 
the path to your incoming messages,  though all parameters can be supplied 
on the command line, too). 
Then change the Makefile for the installation directories and the compiler
flags (if needed). After that, run make to build the executable and 
make install to install xvboxled and the manpage in the specified directories.
Run xvboxled -help to get a list of the command line options. If a mouse 
button is pressed within the program window, the vbox program (or whichever 
you specified) is run to display (and play) the messages in the incoming dir.

Note: xvboxled relies on the fact that the vbox sets the x flag of a 
message file after it was played to detect if a message has already been
heard, i.e. by default it counts only those messages which are not marked 
as executable.
If you want to have the number of all messages beeing displayed, run xvboxled
with the -all command line switch.
