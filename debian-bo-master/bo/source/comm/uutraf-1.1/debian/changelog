	* Incorporated patches of Yves Arrouge to fix 
	  core dump of uutraf with his data (Bug#3936):
         
           - support for rnews statistics 
             (on by default on Debian, see the MOREDEFS assignement 
              in debian.rules);
           - corrected mail statistics: received mails were counted 
             as received files and vice-versa;

           - new search of stats entry taking into account the 
             send/receive indication and the size of the file/mail; 
             without that, traffic was not correctly summed because 
             of the time gap between dates in Log and Stats;

           - new fields in uutraf.cf (cf. uutraf(5) manual page).

	* Fixed line numbering of the config file (Bug#3937)
