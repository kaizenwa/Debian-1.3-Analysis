WARNING: This release does not contain a hardware driver for UMC modems.
         Please continue to use the Aug06 version of vgetty, if you have one
         of these modems.


  Hints for installation
 ------------------------

The number of bug reports has drastically decreased, so either all people
gave up or there are not so many bugs left. For those, who start with
vgetty, I would like to give you some hints. The documentation is still
missing, so you are pretty much on your own. Many questions have been
answered on the mgetty mailing list, so you might want to have a look at the
archive of this mailing list, if you have a problem. The basic setup
includes the following steps:

1. Compile and install mgetty. See the instructions for mgetty how to do
   that.

2. Compile vgetty. There should be nothing special to do. Just type "make"
   from within the voice directory. If you managed it to compile mgetty, you
   should be able to compile vgetty without any problems. If not, please
   mail me your problems.

3. Do "make install" as root from within the voice directory. Since you are
   always concerned about hackers, wanting to overtake your system, you will
   first do a "make -n install" to see all the evil things, the installation
   procedure will do.

4. Copy the file voice.conf-dist to the same directory as all the mgetty
   config files. Rename it from voice.conf-dist to voice.conf.

5. Replace the invocation of mgetty in your /etc/inittab with vgetty.

6. The vgetty logfiles are by default in /var/log/vgetty.ttyxx.log and the
   vm logfile is in /var/log/vm.log. Read these files if you have problems,
   they are quite readable and give you many hints, where the problem is. If
   you want to see more details in the logfile, increase the debug level in
   your voice.conf file to the highest possible value.

That should hopefully give you enough information to compile and install
vgetty on your system. If you have problems, feel free to write me a mail.
I'm always very busy, so it might take a while until you receive a reply
from me. If you don't get one within 14 days, something went wrong and you
should try again.

If you have problems with playing or recording messages with your local
telephone, you might be interested in the ZyXEL switch box. This box is
useful for modems, that do not provide power for a telephone connected to
the modem. With this switch box you can record and play messages with your
local telephone. To record and play messages, use vm with the -t option to
tell the modem to use the telco line.

There is also a frontend called PalMail, that is not yet included in mgetty,
but it will in the near future. For more details see the WWW-page:
