Hi all!

This is yet another vgetty test release.

Please have a look at the voice/ToDo file. If there is something missing,
that you would like to see, please let me know, I probably add it to the
ToDo list. If there is something you want to do, please get in contact with
me first, to avoid, that two people are working on the same problem.

Now the good things:

* Bug fixes for the Cirrus Logic driver.

* Another try to fix the problems with the Rockwell driver.

* Some fixes to the vgetty answering code (ignore missing greeting message).

* Added new converter for GSM based USR modems.

* Added new converter for .wav files.

* Fixed EOF problem with pvftools on Solaris.

* Replaced the mvm script with a pointer to the alpha test site.

* New hardware driver for ISDN4Linux. Please make sure, that you use the
  latest ISDN4Linux release, because previous releases contain bugs, so
  that the ISDN driver doesn't work with vgetty.

The new release is included in the latest mgetty-beta on ftp.leo.org as
always.

Enjoy,
Marc
