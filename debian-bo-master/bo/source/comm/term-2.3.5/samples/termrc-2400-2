# This is what I use at both ends of a connection where the remote host
# speaks XON/XOFF to its local switch connector, but the switch internally
# runs at 9600 baud with no flow control, and therefore tends to lose data
# if more than three 256-byte packets arrive at the 2400 baud modem at once.
# The packetsize 240 keeps total size with headers and acks under the limit,
# while still allowing three packets to be in flight at one time.  (metcalf)
# For a description of what the options mean, look at the TERMRC file.
