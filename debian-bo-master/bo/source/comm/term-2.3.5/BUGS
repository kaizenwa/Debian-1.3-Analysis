OK, here are the known bugs in the current release:

  1.  There is no clean way to abort tdownload.  (Not likely
      to be solved for quite some time.)

  2.  UDP traffic to localhost, will often go to remotehost
      instead, or not work at all.  (Doesn't seem to be 100%
      solvable, but at least some cases should be solvable.)

  3.  "linecheck" does not properly test flow control characters
      17 and 19.  (This will take someone ambitious to solve.)

  4.  "term_read()" and "term_write()" is needed for programs like "xpilot".
      (Studying the problem.)

  5.  "linuxxdoom+term" runs much slower than "linuxxdoom" runs over SLIP.
      (I've currently set this problem aside, since even over SLIP 
      "linuxxdoom" is too slow to play...)

  6.  "trsh" is running into alot of "Broken Pipe" errors and is often 
      returning without doing anything.

  7.  "terminal_raw()" seems to be broken for some OS's, causing duplication
      of things sent to "trsh".

  8.  "socket off" in the termrc file, causes all "trsh" requests to be 
      rejected, until after "txconn" or "tredir" transfers a connection.
      i.e.  "tredir 4023 23;telnet localhost 23" allows "trsh" to work
      normally again.

  9.  According to John Birchfield jb%sparky.csustan.edu@altair.csustan.edu
      2.3.0 hangs on BSDI
