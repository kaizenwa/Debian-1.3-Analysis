OK.  Before mailing me, or posting on the net, be sure to read the following:

  FAQ
  Term.HOWTO
  Any relevant README file.

At this point I recommend posting to comp.misc.protocols.  I will read these
messages, and be just as likely to help you as with private e-mail.   The
main advantage of posting is that other people can offer there assistance
as well!!!  Please include any of the following relevant information:

1. Remote TERM version.
2. Local TERM version.
3. Remote unix version.
4. Local unix version.
5. Modem type(s).
6. How the connection was formed.  i.e. seyon, kermit, rsh, telnet, ...
6. A fairly complete description of the problem you are experiencing.
7. Things that you've tried to correct it.
