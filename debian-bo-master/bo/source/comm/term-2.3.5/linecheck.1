.TH LINECHECK 1
.SH NAME
linecheck \- debugging tool for 
.IR term
serial lines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B linecheck 
[--stderr] [--seven_in] [ escape ... ] < /dev/tty?? >/dev/tty??
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR linecheck
program performs a first-order test of the transparency of the link.
.IR Linecheck 
sends packets, once per second, each of which contains one of the 256
possible 8-bit character codes.
The diagnostic output helps you determine which characters do not get
through.
This is important, since almost all of the problems associated with
getting 
.IR term 
running occur because individual characters or character
sequences do not get through the serial link or cause other characters
to be sent and/or echoed by the link.
.IR Term
can easily be told to avoid sending these characters by listing them
in the termrc file, the problem is
determining which ones to avoid.
.IR Linecheck
tests all 256 individual characters and helps you determine which are
not getting through.  It only checks individual characters, not character sequences.  If you specify the "--seven_in" option, linecheck will apply as seven
bit mask to the characters it receives.  (This is only needed if you are
using a parity bit on with a seven bit line.  Try linecheck first without
this option.)
.PP
.IR Linecheck
must be run on both systems the same way 
.IR term
is run.
That is, the stdin and stdout should be directed to the serial port
while the stderr goes to the log file linecheck.log.
Remotely you can type
.PP
\ \ \ linecheck 
.PP
to the sh, or
.PP
\ \ \ sh -c 'exec linecheck'
.PP
to the csh.
Locally you should escape from your comm program and type something
like
.PP
\ \ \ linecheck < /dev/modem > /dev/modem
.PP
to a sh.
.PP
You can tell linecheck not to test certain characters by listing their decimal numbers
on the command line.  For instance, if you know flow-control will get eaten,
you can use "linecheck 17 19", and it won't test those chars.  Or, if
your link goes through an 
.IR rlogin (1)
on the remote end, you will want to put 126 on the command line to
escape the '~' character.  Also, in this case, you'll want to use
.PP
\ \ \ rlogin <system> -8 -L
.PP
in a bid to establish a maximally transparent rlogin.
.PP
Once
.IR linecheck
has finished running on both ends, you should examine the
respective log files on the two systems.
These files will contain lines of the form '<num> sending
char' and '<num> received valid', where <num> is the
decimal number of the character in the packet.  
These indicate that the local
.IR linecheck
(the one generating the log file)
sent the character or received the character from the other 
.IR linecheck.
It's normal if the 'sending' and 'received' numbers are not in sync.
.PP
Lines of the form 'Invalid packet: <data>' are the interesting output.
They indicate a packet was received, but was corrupted.
This may be due to simple line noise, or to
the opacity of the link to a character generated by either the remote
or the local
.IR linecheck
program.
At least three possible kinds of link opacity can lead to invalid
packets.  When a character that should be be escaped is sent
the link may simply not transmit the character
in question, or the link may transmit a different or extra characters.
Also, at the same time, the link itself may echo characters back to
the system which sent the character in the first place.
You must study the log files from both systems to determine which
direction of the link causes the problems and which characters should
be escaped on which system.
Real link problems like these should be repeatable while line noise
effects will not.
.PP
The bottom of the log file lists characters that linecheck believes
should be escaped by the other system in the termrc file.
These are characters that the other system sent, but which were not
received correctly.
If you had no invalid packets then this summary is probably reliable.
If there were invalid packets it is possible that 
.IR linecheck's
recommendations are wrong.  You must examine both logs closely to
determine what caused the invalid packets.
.PP
If, for some reason, you get stuck out in lala land, and can't kill
the remote program,
try typing '00000'.  That should kill it, and restore your terminal.
.SH BUGS
.IR Linecheck
is too slow and won't detect if 17 and 19 need to be escaped.
