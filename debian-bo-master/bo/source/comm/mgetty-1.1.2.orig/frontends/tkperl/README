These programs need the nTkPerl extentions to Perl 5.001

Warning: there are *two* TkPerl extention packages. Do *NOT* use the
"tkperl5a5" written by Malcolm Beattie, it's outdated and not maintained
any more.

Get ftp://ftp.wpi.edu/perl5/Tk-b8.tar.gz, written by Nick Ing-Simmons!

Warning2: right now, this is "under construction", nothing will work :(


Description:

  * faxman.pl : a very nice fax queue manager by Klaus Lichtenwalder,
		manages both input and output queues, printing, viewing,
		requeueing, ... -- try it!

  * xfax.pl   : a better-looking frontend to "faxspool", by me
