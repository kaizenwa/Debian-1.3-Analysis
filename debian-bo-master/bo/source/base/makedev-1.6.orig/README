Readme file for MAKEDEV-C:

MAKEDEV is a program to create the special file entries found in /dev.
MAKEDEV-C is a compiled binary that runs from a config file,
/etc/devinfo. The config file is intended to be fairly human-readable,
as well as machine-readable.

New in release 1.6:

The configuration files have been updated to reflect kernel 2.x, and
have thus grown enormously. Older releases of MAKEDEV-C will overflow
on this release's devinfo file. 

New in release 1.5:

Configuration files (devinfo and makedev.cfg) are now located only in
/etc, or /usr/local/etc for devinfo.local.
Several bug fixes, both to the code and to devinfo.
The supplied makefile is now vaguely useful.
Some testing options are now not compiled in by default.

New in release 1.4.1:

Substantial updates to DEVINFO. Most notably:
	- hdc and hdd are now the drives on the 2nd IDE controller. 
	  This is NOT how it used to be, nor is it how the shell MAKEDEV
	  does it, but it's what the kernel source indicates is right.
	- SCSI tapes were totally messed up in the last release.
	- New and more appropriate QIC device names.
	- Assorted fixes. (See DEVINFO itself for more details.)

Some changes to the sample MAKEDEV.cfg:
	- added a class "system" (root.system, mode 660)
	- do not omit hdc and hdd by default, as they now mean
	  something more useful than they used to.
