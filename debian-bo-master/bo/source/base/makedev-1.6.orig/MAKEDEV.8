.TH MAKEDEV 8 "March 1995" "Version 1.5"
.SH NAME
MAKEDEV \- create and maintain filesystem device entries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B MAKEDEV
[
.I \-vcdnhV
]
device or device-group name(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B MAKEDEV
is used to maintain the special filesystem entries found in /dev. It
creates, or optionally removes, one or more device entries. The names 
and device numbers are defined in the 
.B devinfo 
file (q.v.);
site-specific configuration is found in the file MAKEDEV.cfg. 
.B MAKEDEV
itself has no knowledge of device information.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -v 
Verbose mode; print out exactly what's being done.
.TP
.I -c
Create; create the specified devices. [default]
.TP
.I -d
Delete; remove the specified devices instead of creating them.
.TP
.I -n
Do nothing; only print what would be done. Implies -v as well.
.TP
.I -h
Print a usage message.
.TP
.I -V
Print the version string.
.SS " "
The following targets are special:
.TP
.I update
Run MAKEDEV in update mode. This reads the list of devices currently
available from /proc/devices, and updates all entries in /dev to match
the device numbers found there.
.TP
.I local
Run MAKEDEV to create local devices. This option is obsolete and just
prints a warning message. Use devinfo.local and makedev.cfg to achieve
the same results.
