.TH SAVELOG 8 "24 April 1996" "Debian Linux"
.SH NAME
savelog \- save a log file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "savelog [ -m " "mode" " ] [ -u " " user" " ] [ -g " "group" \
" ] [ -t ] [ -c " "cycle" " ] [ -l ] " "file " "..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B savelog
command saves and optionally compresses old copies of files.  Older versions
of
.I file
are named:
.RS

.IR "file" "." "<number>" "" "<compress_suffix>"

.RE
where 
.I <number>
is the version number, 0 being the newest.  By default,
version numbers > 0 are compressed (unless
.B -l
prevents it).  Version number 0 is never compressed on the off chance
that a process still has 
.I file
opened for I/O.

If the file does not exist, and
.B -t
was given, it will be created.

For files that do exist and have lengths greater than zero, the following
actions are performed:

.IP 1)
Version numbered files are cycled.  Version
.IR cycle -2
is moved to version
.IR cycle "-1,"
version
.IR cycle -3
is moved to version
.IR cycle "-2 ,"
and so on.  Finally version 0 is moved to version 1.  Both
compressed names and uncompressed names are cycled, regardless of
.BR -l .
Missing version files are ignored.

.IP 2)
The new
.I file.1
is compressed unless the
.B -l
flag was given.  It is changed subject to the
.BR "-m" ", " "-u" ", and " "-g"
flags.

.IP 3)
The main file is moved to
.IR file.0 .

.IP 4)
If the
.BR "-m" ", " "-u" ", " "-g" ", or " "-t"
flags are given, then
.I file
is created (as an empty file) subject to the given flags.

.IP 5)
The new
.I file.0
is changed subject to the
.BR "-m" ", " "-u" ", and " "-g"
flags.

Since the version numbers start with 0, version number
.I cycle
is never formed.  The
.I cycle
count must be at least 2.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-m mode"
chmod the log files to mode
.TP
.B "-u user"
chown log files to user
.TP
.B "-g group"
chgrp log files to group
.TP
.B "-c cycle"
Save cycle versions of the logfile (default: 7)
.TP
.B -t
touch file
.TP
.B -l
don't compress any log files (default: do compress)

.SH BUGS
If a process is still writing to
.IR "file.0" ","
and savelog moves it to
.I file.1
and compresses it, data could be lost.
