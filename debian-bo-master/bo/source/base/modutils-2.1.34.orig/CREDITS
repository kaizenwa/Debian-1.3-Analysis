Though insmod and genksyms represent entirely new code, it would be
remiss not to acknowledge the work of those that came before.

Bjorn Eckwall was responsible for the bulk of the actual code on these
utilities.  Unfortunately, the listed contact address, bj0rn@blox.se,
appears to be inactive.

Jacques Gelinas <jack@solucorp.qc.ca> originated the idea of modversions
and kerneld, wrote depmod/modprobe, and has been maintaining the package
since Bjorn vanished.

The following list of ancillary credits is taken from the 2.1.13 source:
