Version 1.3 

Numerous changes, performance enhancements, code cleanups and bug fixes.
Too many to individually summarize.  Have a look at the top of each
source file for more information.

** Default behavior of sysklogd is not to accept any message that
is sent via syslog/udp.  To allow remote reception add -r to the
command-line arguments.

** Spaces are now accepted in the syslog configuration file.  This
should be a real crowd pleaser.

syslogd now uses dynamic allocation of logging output descriptors.
There is no longer a static limit on the number of log destinations
that can be defined.

klogd supports on-the-fly kernel address to symbol translations.
This requires that a valid kernel symbol map be found at execution.

** The default level for console log messages was changed to 6.  This
means that kernel messages with a priority less than or equal to 5
(KERN_NOTICE) will be logged to the console.

	This item has been flagged because it results in a behavior
	change which will be different if version 1.3 replaces an
	existing 1.2 binary.  Linus strongly suggested that this
	behavior be changed and in the 1.3.3x kernels Linus in fact
	made it impossible to set the console log level lower than
	about 5.

	There were good reasons from his perspective for doing so.
	The most troublesome being that user's of packaged
	distributions were not able to generate register dumps with
	the kernel debugging keys, most notably altgr-SCRLCK.

	If a kernels prior to 1.3.3x are being used the klogd daemon
	invocation must be changed to something like: klogd -c 1
	
	This will turn off logging of kernel messages to the console.
	If you understand the ramifications of this the 1.3.3x kernels
	can be patched to allow the suppression of console log
	messages.  It is important to be cognizant of the effects of
	these changes.  None the least of which is that Linus and Alan
	will yell at you if you complain about not being able to
	generate kernel debugging information.. :-)

Version 1.2
Fixes to both klogd and syslogd so that the package will compile without
errors due to the vararg procedures.

Modified pid files produced so that the names of the files are
klogd.pid and syslogd.pid respectively.

Fixed bug in klogd which prevented output from being directed to a file
when the program was compiled to auto-background itself.  In the
auto-backgrounding configuration the forked process was closing all its
file descriptors which was causing the errant behavior.

Modified signal handling in klogd so that all signal are set to ignored
before establishing specific signal handlers.

Fixed bug in syslogd which was causing a delay in opening of the /dev/log
UNIX domain socket.  This should correct the race condition which was
preventing klogd from properly logging kernel messages when the two
daemons were started in rapid succession.

Modified the closing/opening of file descriptors when syslogd was
compiled with auto-backgrounding support.  Closes the potential for
a somewhat obscure bug caused by the /dev/log socket being opened on
fd 0.

Changed the names of the man pages from an extension of 1 to 8.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1
Extensive changes and additional functionality added to klogd.  Please
see sources and man-pages for documentation.

Fixed bugs in both syslogd and klogd with respect to fragmented
message re-assembly.  Bootup messages should now be display properly.

Fixed bug in syslogd which prevented proper logging of messages with
priority classes of none and emerg.

Fixed bug which caused core dump when messages were logged to users.
Also fixed bug with messages to login type of LOGIN.

Fixed problem with zombies being left when messages were logged to
multiple users.

Enhanced functionality of syslog_tst program.

Added man-pages.
