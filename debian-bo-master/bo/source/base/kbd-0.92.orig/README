This is kbd-0.91.tar.gz

The programs loadkeys, dumpkeys and showkey were derived from
Risto Kankkunen's kbd-0.81.

The font loading code goes back to the codepage package by
Joel Hoffman (joel@wam.umd.edu). (He tells me that the original
reference is: "From: p. 307 of _Programmer's Guide to PC & PS/2
Video Systems_ by Richard Wilton. 1987.  Microsoft Press".)

The kernel and user interface for the font loading were derived
from Eugene Crosser's intl_con package.

[Similar things were done earlier by
 Jerry Kaidor (tr2!jerry@abekas.com, jkaidor@synoptics.com) : fontpak,
 H. Peter Anvin (hpa@nwu.edu) and Pavel Zaboj (xzaboj@vse.cs).
Their code was not used, but the Latin-1 *.psf fonts were developed
by H. Peter Anvin, and the Latin-2 ones by Pavel Zaboj.]

This package contains keytable files and keyboard utilities compatible
with kernel version 1.1.54 and later. Setfont requires 1.1.92 or later.

This distribution contains no binaries - the sources depend on the
kernel version - compile them yourself.

To install this package, unpack it somewhere and issue the commands
"make" and "make install". This copies the utilities to /usr/bin,
man pages to /usr/man/man{1,4,5,8} and data files to the subdirectories
keytables, consolefonts, consoletrans and videomodes of /usr/lib/kbd.
