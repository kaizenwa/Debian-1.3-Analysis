Changes from the prerelease to version 0.8:

o Enhanced the shorthand notation `keycode xx = a', where `a' is an
  ASCII letter and changed `dumpkeys' and `loadkeys' accordingly.
  Now this entry defines useful values in shift+control, meta+shift,
  meta+control and meta+control+shift keytables, too. AltGr entries
  also default now to the value of non-AltGr entries.
o Added the possibility to split long lines into multiple shorter ones
  by appending a backslash at the end of each partial line.
o Added a version number and a short usage message to `dumpkeys'
o Added the options --short-info, --long-info (replaces the symbol
  dump, -s), --numeric, --full-table, --funcs-only, --keys-only to
  `dumpkeys'. See manpage for more info.
o Added a version number, a short usage message and the ability to load
  multiple map files at a time to `loadkeys'.
o Added the utility `mktable' to generate the kernel default binding
  table automatically from the currently loaded keytable.
o Added the utility `showkey' for interactively inspecting the
  scancodes and keycode values sent by key presses and releases.
o Fixed the value of Uncaps_Shift, eliminated obsolete Map_xx symbols
o Added Meta_Control_xxx symbols.
o Added symbols for locking modifiers (kernel 0.99pl12 doesn't support this)

Changes from version 0.8 to version 0.81:

o Updated and fixed the keytable files
o Minor additions to the loadkeys man page
o Added support for ISO 8859-{2,3,4} character symbols, updated
  dumpkeys man page accordingly

Changes from version 0.81 to version 0.82 (aeb@cwi.nl):

o Made mktable an option of loadkeys, so that the file defkeymap.c
  produced is independent of the current kernel, and independent of
  the current keyboard settings. (The old mktable program is now
  obsolete.)
o After  dumpkeys > x; loadkeys x; dumpkeys > y  the files x and y
  should be identical. They were not. I hope they are now.
o Showkey now restores the original keyboard mode.
o Loadkeys now accepts quotes and backslashes in strings.
o Added compose key support.

Changes for 0.83 (aeb):

o Added KT_LETTER, so that CapsLock can work correctly.
  For the time being, this is denoted by a leading + in the keymap.
o Added setfont, showfont, mapscrn.
o Added setleds, setmetamode.
o Put data by default in three subdirectories of /usr/lib/kbd.

Changes for 0.84 (aeb):

o Added more compose key support to loadkeys.
o Setfont, loadkeys and mapscrn look by default in /usr/lib/kbd/*.
o Setfont can read codepage font files (and select a font from them).
o Many minor changes.

Changes for 0.85-0.86 (aeb):

o Minor things only. Added contributed keymaps and fonts.

Changes for 0.87 (aeb):

o Added iso-8859-8 support. Added "charset" directive.
o Corrected a typo in "trivial".
o Added kbd_mode.
o Extended kbd.FAQ. Added contributed keymaps and fonts.

Changes for 0.88 (aeb):

o Added dynamic keymap support. Added "keymaps" directive.
o Added dynamic console allocation. Added disalloc.
o Added resize.
o Changed LED handling.
o Added the contributed codepage.c (to extract codepages from a
  DOS .cpi file).
o Many minor changes.

Changes for 0.89 (aeb):

o Some minor things.

Changes for 0.90 (aeb):

o Changed setfont to subsume mapscrn and escape sequence.
o Added hpa's psftable stuff.
o Added Unicode stuff (requires kernel 1.1.92 or later).

Changes for 0.91 (aeb):

o Added hpa's setfont patch
