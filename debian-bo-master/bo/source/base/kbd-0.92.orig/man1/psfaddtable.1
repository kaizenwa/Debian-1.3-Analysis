.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psfaddtable
fontfile tablefile [outfile]
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "psfaddtable command" "" "\fLpsfaddtable\fR command"  
.LP
.B psfaddtable
takes a console font in .psf format given by
.I fontfile
and merges it with the Unicode character table given by
.I tablefile
to produce a font file with an embedded character table, which is
written to
.I outfile
if given, or else to standard output.  Either
.I fontfile
or
.I outfile
(but not both) can be replaced by a single dash (\-) to read from
standard input instead.  If the
.I fontfile
already contains an embedded character table, it is ignored.
.SH TABLE FILE FORMAT
Each line in the
.I tablefile
should be either blank, contain a comment (preceded by
.IR # ),
or contain a sequence of numbers in either decimal (default), octal
(preceded by
.IR 0 ),
or hexadecimal (preceded by
.IR 0x )
format.  The first number on each line indicates the glyph slot in the
font that is being referred to, this is between 0 and 0xff for a
256-character font and 0 and 0x1ff for a 512-character font.  Any
subsequent numbers on the same line are Unicodes matched by this
specific glyph slot.  It is permissible to have multiple lines for the
same glyph.
