People keep sending various adduser programs and scripts...  They are
all in this directory.  I haven't tested them, use at your own risk.

atudel is a perl script to remove at jobs owned by a specified user
(atrm in at-2.9 for Linux can't do that).

Any volunteers to write a nice menu-based (ncurses) program for
system administrators (a la SCO sysadmsh)?
