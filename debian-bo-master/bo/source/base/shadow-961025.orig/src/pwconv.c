 * pwconv - convert and update shadow password files
 *
 *	Pwconv copies the old password file information to a new shadow
 *	password file, merging entries from an optional existing shadow
 *	file.
 *
 *	The new password file is left in npasswd, the new shadow file is
 *	left in nshadow.  Existing shadow entries are copied as is.
 *	New entries are created with passwords which expire in MAXDAYS days,
 *	with a last changed date of today, unless password aging
 *	information was already present.  Likewise, the minimum number of
 *	days before which the password may be changed is controlled by
 *	MINDAYS.  The number of warning days is set to WARNAGE if that
 *	macro exists.  Entries with blank passwordsare not copied to the
 *	shadow file at all.
