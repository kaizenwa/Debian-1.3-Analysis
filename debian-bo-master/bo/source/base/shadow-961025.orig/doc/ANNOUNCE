This is a new beta release of the Shadow Password Suite for Linux.
Many bugs have been reported (and fixed!), and the package is now
under a BSD-style copyright.  It was written by John F. Haugh II
<jfh@rpp386.cactus.org>, and the Linux port is now maintained by me.

Again, this is beta software which may still have some bugs, please
treat it as such.  Please don't install it if you don't know what
you're doing.  Please test it as much as you can, and report any
bugs - if you report them, they will be fixed!  If all goes well,
Shadow should be stable enough for general use within a few months.
Once it is stable, Linux distributions can start using it - there
are no copyright problems anymore.

Thanks to Greg Gallagher <ggallag@orion.it.luc.edu> there is now
a developers mailing list, shadow-list@neptune.cin.net.  Send the
command "subscribe" to shadow-list-request@neptune.cin.net (NOT to
the mailing list itself!) to subscribe if you are interested.
