.SH NAME
pwconv \- convert and update shadow password files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pwconv
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBPwconv\fR copies the old password file information to a new shadow
password file,
merging entries from an optional existing shadow file.
The new password file is left in \fInpasswd\fR,
the new shadow file is left in \fInshadow\fR.
Both of these are files are created with modes which only permit
read access to the owner.
Existing shadow entries are copied as is.
Shadow entries in the System V Release 3.2 format will be silently
converted to the new System V Release 4 format on output.
Any entries which are missing fields will have those fields
filled in with default values where appropriate.
New entries are created with passwords which expire in 10000 days,
with a last changed date of today,
unless password aging information was already present.
Entries with blank passwords are not copied to the shadow file at all.
.SH FILES
/etc/passwd \- old encrypted passwords and password aging
.br
/etc/shadow \- previously converted shadow password file
.br
./npasswd \- new password file
.br
./nshadow \- new shadow password file
