.TH UMOUNT 8 "5 July 1996" "Linux 2.0" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
umount \- unmount file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "umount [\-hV]"
.LP
.BI "umount -a [\-nv] [\-t " vfstype ]
.br
.BI "umount [\-nv] " "device " | " dir " [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B umount
command detaches the file system(s) mentioned from the file hierarchy.
A file system is specified either by giving the directory where it
has been mounted, or by giving the special device on which it lives.

Note that a file system cannot be unmounted when it is `busy' -
for example, when there are open files on it, or when some process
has its working directory there, or when a swap file on it is in use.
The offending process could even be
.B umount
itself - it opens libc, and libc in its turn may open for example
locale files.

Options for the
.B umount
command:
.TP
.B \-V
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B \-h
Print help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-n
Unmount without writing in
.IR /etc/mtab .
.TP
.B \-a
All of the file systems described in
.I /etc/mtab
are unmounted.
.TP
.BI \-t " vfstype"
Indicate that the actions should only be taken on file systems of the
specified type.  More than one type may be specified in a comma separated
list.  The list of file system types can be prefixed with
.B no
to specify the file system types on which no action should be taken.

.SH "THE LOOP DEVICE"
The
.B umount
command will free the loop device (if any) associated
with the mount, in case it finds the option `loop=...' in
.IR /etc/mtab .
Any pending loop devices can be freed using `losetup -d', see
.BR losetup (8).
