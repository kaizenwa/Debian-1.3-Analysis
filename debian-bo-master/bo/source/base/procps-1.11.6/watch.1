.TH WATCH 1 "19 Feb 1997" "Debian GNU/Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME 
watch \- run and watch a program with a fixed update interval
.SH SYNOPSIS
watch [\fB\-n \fIsec\fR] command [args]
.SH DESCRIPTION
watch will run the specified command every 
.I n
seconds and display its output on the terminal using the 
.I curses
library. If no interval is specified using the 
.B \-n
option, it will run the command every 2 seconds. The program will end
if it gets a keyboard interrupt (usually 
.IR "<CTRL\-C>" ")."
.SH EXAMPLE
watch -n 1 ps -ux

Note that, even though this example was the original purpose of this
program, this is more effectively achieved using the 
.BR top (1)
program. 
.SH AUTHOR
this implementation of watch was written by Tony Rems and posted to 
.IR comp.sources.unix
in 1984. Francois Pinard modified and corrected it in 1991. This
manpage was written by Helmut Geyer.
