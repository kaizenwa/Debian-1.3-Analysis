fix free.c and xcpustate to use libproc instead of their own meminfo stuff?
Maybe not worth it.

update gfinger.p ? does anyone care?

write pscolors program similar to the dircolors program.
write manpages for libproc - mostly done
rewrite meminfo stuff in proc/sysinfo.c

[ Probably the best solution for inline string stuff would be for the libc
string.h to architecture-conditionally #include the inline string functions.
It might be worth the extra 4 bytes per .o for ___strtok's to have them all
internally linked so string.h could just define it.  Not really a TODO item.]
