This is a collection of programs from 4.4BSD-Lite that are not (yet)
included with the GNU system.  It was constructed for inclusion in
Debian Linux.  As programs found here become available under the GPL
licence, they will be replaced.

This package is based on the original bsdutils package put together by
Ian Murdock <imurdock@gnu.ai.mit.edu>, but has now been split into a
much slimmer bsdutils (this package) and bsdmainutils, the core of the
BSD tools that used to be in bsdutils.

This package is now being maintained by Austin Donnelly
<and1000@debian.org>. Please report any problems or suggested
additions or changes to me.

This package has been updated to Debian's new packaging system, by Shaya 
Potter <spotter@itd.nrl.navy.mil>.  However, he is not maintaining the 
package.
