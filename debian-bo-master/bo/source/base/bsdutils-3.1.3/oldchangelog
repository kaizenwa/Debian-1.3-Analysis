	* debian.control: changed to not use pre-depends for sysvinit, but
	  plain depends.

	* released version 3.0-2


Wed Apr 17 14:03:11 1996  Austin Donnelly  <and1000@valour.pem.cam.ac.uk>

	* debian.control: changed to pre-depends on sysvinit with mesg
	  command.

	* debian.rules: bumped version number

	* released version 3.0-1


Mon Apr 15 21:40:32 1996  Austin Donnelly  <and1000@valour.pem.cam.ac.uk>

	* wall.c: added about 5 lines to fix problem with wrapping long
	  lines (as reported in Bug#2407). This was a bug in the upstream
	  code.

	* ttymsg.c: added line to check terminal is not "tty??" before
	  writing to it. This is a work-around for a utmp bug that leaves
	  these bogus entries lying around. Fixes Bug#2270.

	* Released version 3.0-0, to go with new style bsdmainutils.

Tue Jan 16 23:13:53 1996  Austin Donnelly  <and1000@valour.pem.cam.ac.uk>

	* Recompiled for ELF :-
	
	* debian.control: add dependancy on libc5, libdb1, ncurses3.0
		(they used to be part of libc4, but were split off for
		 libc5)
	
	* debian.rules: change sed to look in right place for version
		number

	* Makefile: changed link line for ul to link against ncurses, not
		libtermcap

	* vacation.c: include <db/db.h> now, instead of <db.h>

	* tsort.c: include <db/db.h> now, instead of <db.h>

	* display.c: removed hard-wired sizes of types: now defined in
		system headers.

	* Bumped major version to 2.0 - ELF release.


Tue Nov 28 17:18:36 1995  Austin Donnelly  <and1000@valour.pem.cam.ac.uk>

	* debian.rules: oops!  Forgot to make write and wall setgid tty -
	they don't work.


Tue Nov 28 00:12:31 1995  Austin Donnelly  <and1000@valour.pem.cam.ac.uk>

	* kill.c: added linux signals, changed signal listing code to not
	segfault, and changed signal parsing code to not segfault on
	"SIGHUP". Fixes Bug#1764 and Bug#1513.

	* kill.1: now mentions the fact that kill is a bash builtin.

	* removed pwd from the bsdutils package: we're now using the one
	from the GNU shellutils package.


Sun Nov 26 16:46:27 1995  Austin Donnelly  <and1000@valour.pem.cam.ac.uk>

	* wall.c: added line to ignore utmp entries for ':0', so that the
	special entry made for X on the console isn't written to. Bug#1630.

	* write.c: added checks to make sure only live utmp entries are
 	considered, and added better checks to ensure you can't write if
 	you've su'ed in someone else's shell.  'write' is now setgid tty
 	safely. Bug#1545.

	* write.c: only warn if root writes with messages turned off,
	rather than forbid (as per normal users). Bug#1658.
	
	
Sat Nov 25 22:48:31 1995  Austin Donnelly  <and1000@valour.pem.cam.ac.uk>

	* Package maintainer is now Austin Donnelly, <and1000@cam.ac.uk>

	* err.c: added an err_setprogname() function to allow programs
	that want to use the error handling stuff to set their name
	correctly. Previously, they were getting their name set to
	NULL. Bug#1207.

	* err.h: added prototype for err_setprogname().
	
	* cal.c: registered name with error handler.
	* calendar.c: registered name with error handler.
	* chroot.c: registered name with error handler.
	* col.c: registered name with error handler.
	* column.c: registered name with error handler.
	* kill.c: registered name with error handler.
	* mesg.c: registered name with error handler.
	* pwd.c: registered name with error handler.
	* tsort.c: registered name with error handler.

	* vacation.c: was implicitly casting NULL to an int. Fixed.

	* whois.c: implicitly dropping 'const' from a char *. Now keeps
	it's const-ness

	* ttymsg.c: introduced new error message to complain about stale
 	utmp entries (/dev/tty??). This is really a bug in telnetd or
 	rlogind. I think there's a race between getting a utmp entry, and
 	getting a tty assigned. Would the telnetd/rlogind maintainer like
 	to investigate?  Bug#1892.


Thu Jun 22 14:14:59 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* Version 1.3 is released.

	* wall.c (main): Use the ut_type element of struct utmp to
	determine if a utmp entry is to be ignored, not getpwnam.

Tue May 30 08:43:15 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* Version 1.2 is released.

	* parse.c: Applied patch from N. D. Turton to fix hexdump.

Wed May 10 11:46:01 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* Removed od.1 from the distribution package.  In Debian
	GNU/Linux, we use the od program from the GNU textutils.

Tue May  9 15:58:22 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* chroot.8: Updated to indicate difference between Debian
	GNU/Linux version and 4.4BSD-Lite version.

	* chroot.c (main): Do not chdir, only chroot, to argv[0].

Mon May  8 10:00:31 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* wall.c (main): Add call to `getpwnam' to determine whether
	`ut_name' is actually a user.  If not a user (i.e., `getpwnam'
	returns NULL), a copy of the message is not sent to `ut_line'.

Mon Apr 24 19:42:31 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* wall.c (makemsg): Prepend the message with a newline ('\n')
	before the carriage return ('\r') so that the prompt does not
	get obliterated.

Mon Mar 20 11:10:36 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* Version 1.1 is released.

	* calendar.c (opencal): Behave like a "traditional" cpp
	and inhibit generation of `#' lines in the output.

	* look.c (main): Pass "MAP_FILE | MAP_SHARED" as argument
	FLAGS instead of "0".

Sun Mar 19 08:45:21 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* Makefile (install): Install calendar files to
        `/usr/lib/calendar', not `/usr/lib/calendars'.

	* Makefile (install): Install calendar files as
        mode 644, not 755.

Sat Mar 18 10:53:39 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* Added `whois' and `whois.1'

Mon Jan 16 19:36:17 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debra.debian.org>

	* Version 1.0 is released.
