.TH SHUTDOWN 8 "20 November 1993" "Linux 1.2" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
shutdown \- close down the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "shutdown [ \-h | \-r ] [ \-fqs ] [ now | " hh:ss " | " +mins " ]"
.BR "reboot [ \-h | \-r ] [ \-fqs ] [ now | " hh:ss " | " +mins " ]"
.BR "fastboot [ \-h | \-r ] [ \-fqs ] [ now | " hh:ss " | " +mins " ]"
.BR "halt [ \-h | \-r ] [ \-fqs ] [ now | " hh:ss " | " +mins " ]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" " for emacs hilit19
In general,
.B shutdown
prepares the system for a power down or reboot.  A absolute or delta time
can be given, and periodic messages will be sent to all users warning of
the shutdown.

.B halt
is the same as
.B "shutdown -h -q now"

.B fasthalt
is the same as
.B "shutdown -h -q -f now"

.B reboot
is the same as
.B "shutdown -r -q now"

.B fastboot
is the same as
.B "shutdown -r -q -f now"

The default delta time, if none is specified, is 2 minutes.

Five minutes before shutdown (or immediately, if shutdown is less than five
minutes away), the
.I /etc/nologin
file is created with a message stating that the system is going down and
that logins are no longer permitted.  The
.B login (1)
program will not allow non-superusers to login during this period.  A
message will be sent to all users at this time.

When the shutdown time arrives,
.B shutdown
notifies all users, tells
.BR init (8)
not to spawn more
.BR getty (8)'s,
writes the shutdown time into the
.I /var/log/wtmp
file, kills all other processes on the system,
.BR sync (2)'s,
unmounts all the disks,
.BR sync (2)'s
again, waits for a second, and then either terminates or reboots the
system.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Halt the system.  Do not reboot.  This option is used when powering down
the system.
.TP
.B \-r
Reboot the system.
.TP
.B \-f
Fast.  When the system is rebooted, the file systems will not be checked.
This is arranged by creating
.IR /fastboot ,
which
.I /etc/rc
must detect (and delete).
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet.  This uses a default broadcast message, and does not prompt the user
for one.
.TP
.B \-s
Reboot in single user mode.  This is arranged by creating
.IR /etc/singleboot ,
which
.BR simpleinit (8)
detects (and deletes).
.SH FILES
.nf
.I /etc/rc
.I /fastboot
.I /etc/singleboot
.I /etc/nologin
.I /var/log/wtmp
.fi
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR umount (8),
.BR login (1),
.BR reboot (2),
.BR simpleinit (8),
.BR init (8)
.SH BUGS
Unlike the BSD
.BR shutdown ,
users are notified of shutdown only once or twice, instead of many times,
and at shorter and shorter intervals as "apocalypse approaches."
Some would construe this as a feature.
