.SH NAME
kbdrate \- reset the keyboard repeat rate and delay time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "kbdrate [ \-s ] [ \-r"
rate
.B "] [ \-d"
delay
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B kbdrate
is used to change the IBM keyboard repeat rate and delay time.  The delay
is the amount of time that a key must be depressed before it will start to
repeat.

Using
.B kbdrate
without any options will reset the rate to 10.9 characters per second (cps)
and the delay to 250 milliseconds (mS).  These are the IBM defaults.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s
Silent.  No messages are printed.
.TP
.BI \-r " rate"
Change the keyboard repeat rate to
.I rate
cps.  The allowable range is from 2.0 to 30.0 cps.  Only certain, specific
values are possible, and the program will select the nearest possible value
to the one specified.  The possible values are given, in characters per
second, as follows: 2.0, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 3.0, 3.3, 3.7, 4.0, 4.3, 4.6,
5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.7, 7.5, 8.0, 8.6, 9.2, 10.0, 10.9, 12.0, 13.3, 15.0, 16.0,
17.1, 18.5, 20.0, 21.8, 24.0, 26.7, 30.0.
.TP
.BI \-d " delay"
Change the delay to
.I delay
milliseconds.  The allowable range is from 250 to 1000 mS, but the only
possible values (based on hardware restrictions) are: 250mS, 500mS, 750mS,
and 1000mS.
.SH BUGS
Not all keyboards support all rates.
.PP
Not all keyboards have the rates mapped in the same way.
.PP
Setting the repeat rate on the Gateway AnyKey keyboard does not work.  If
someone with a Gateway figures out how to program the keyboard, please send
mail to faith@cs.unc.edu.
