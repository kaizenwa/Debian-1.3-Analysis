util-linux-2.5.tar.gz     (source distribution only)

    WARNING: THIS COLLECTION DOES *NOT* SUPPORT SHADOW PASSWORDS.

    WARNING: THIS COLLECTION DOES *NOT* SUPPORT SYSTEM V INITTAB.

    WARNING: DO *NOT* INSTALL WITHOUT THINKING.

    This is a collection of many assorted utilities for Linux.  Some are
    system utilities that are not easily available anywhere elsewhere
    (e.g., mkfs.minix, mkswap, cfdisk, fdisk); others are BSD ports of
    common utilities that are not yet contained in any FSF package (e.g.,
    col); others are non-System-V alternatives to common utilities (e.g.,
    simpleinit, agetty, login, passwd).

    The arrangement, as nearly as I can determine, conforms to the Linux
    Filesystem Structure, Interim Release 1.2, March 28, 1995, with *NO*
    exceptions.  A copy of the standards document can be found at
    tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/docs/linux-standards/fsstnd/*.

    Many people provided patches and suggestions.  I deeply appreciate
    this.

    This product includes software developed by the University of
    California, Berkeley and its contributors.

    IN THE FUTURE, SEND UPDATES AND PATCHES TO: util-linux@math.uio.no



HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.5:

0) Nicolai Langfeldt is taking over maintenance of util-linux, with the
   help of a few others (Michael K. Johnson, Andries Brouwer, and Rik
   Faith).

        elsie.nci.nih.gov:/pub/tzdata95h.tar.gz
    MAKEDEV-C:
        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Admin/MAKEDEV-C-1.5.tar.gz

        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Admin/MAKEDEV-2.2.tar.gz
    md5sum:
        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/textutils-1.3.tar.gz
        [The GNU version is now compatible with the Plumb/Lankester
        version.]
    ksymoops:
        Now bundled with the kernel in linux/scripts.

2) update_state has been removed
3) fdisk now supports NetBSD disklabels courtesy of Bernhard Fastenrath
   <fasten@athene.informatik.uni-bonn.de> (and > 8GB disks, courtesy of
   Andries Brouwer)
4) mount improved -- many patches from Andries Brouwer for greatly improved
   error reporting
5) ddate, chkdupexe, and other programs have been improved and bug fixed
6) util-linux is now a source-only distribution
7) mcookie generates better random numbers and will use /dev/random or
   /dev/audio if available
8) chfn, chsh, passwd, and vipw have been updated with security patches
   from Zefram <A.Main@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>.  Now, they all use the same
   locking, and several security holes have been patched.  Further, chsh
   and chfn can be configured at compile time to require a password before
   updates and chsh can be configured to only use shells from /etc/shells.
