- A special target for kbrequest, so that extra CHILDs are
  created (each one needs its own utmp/wtmp bookkeeping)
- Extend the initreq.h interface?

- We should move configuration stuff from the rc files
  (like the GMT= in rc.boot) to a "sysconfig" file in /etc.
  This could also be done for init.d/network, /etc/hostname etc.
