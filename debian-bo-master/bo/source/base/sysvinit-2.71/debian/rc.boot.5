.TH RC.BOOT 5 "March 19, 1996" "" "Debian GNU/Linux Manual"
.SH NAME
/etc/rc.boot \- directory for local or per-package boot scripts.
.SH DESCRIPTION
At boot time the directory \fI/etc/rc.boot\fP is scanned by the program
\fBrun-parts\fP(8). The scripts found that have valid filenames for
the \fBrun-parts\fP program will be run in lexical sort order of the
filenames.
.SH EXAMPLES
If you want to run the hdparm program at boot time to set parameters
of the IDE driver, you'd normally stick a line in the \fI/etc/rc.local\fP
file. On debian however this file does not exist. Instead, you put a
script in the \fI/etc/rc.boot\fP directory like this:
.RS
.nf
.ne 7

#! /bin/sh

echo "Running hdparm.."
hdparm -u 1

.fi
.sp
.RE
This script could be named \fIhdparm\fP and should have mode 0755.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
run-parts(8), init(1).
