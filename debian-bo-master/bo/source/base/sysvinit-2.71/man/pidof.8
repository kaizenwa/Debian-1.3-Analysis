.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pidof

.B program
.RB [ program.. ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Pidof
finds the process id's (pids) of the named programs. It prints those
id's on the standard output. This program is typically used in
run-level change scripts, especially when the system has a
\fISystem-V\fP like \fIrc\fP structure. These scripts are then
located in /etc/rc.?d, where ? is the runlevel.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -s
Single shot - this instructs the program to only return one \fIpid\fP.
.IP -x
Scripts too - this causes the program to also return process id's of
shells running the named scripts.
.IP -o \fIomitpid\fP
Tells \fIpidof\fP to omit processes with that process id. The special
pid \fB%PPID\fP can be used to name the parent process of the \fIpidof\fP
program, in other words the calling shell or shell script.
.SH NOTES
\fIpidof\fP is simply a (symbolic) link to the \fIkillall5\fP program,
which should also be located in \fP/sbin\fP.
.SH SEE ALSO
shutdown(8), init(8), halt(8), reboot(8).
