ld.so (1.8.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the shlibs file so other packages would depend on ldso
    instead of libdl1.

ld.so (1.8.10-1) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug in ldconfig where a symlink could be used
    instead of a regular file.

  * Fixed a Debian packaging problem for the sparc 
    architecture.

ld.so (1.8.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed ldconfig to only cache the symlinks it creates.
    This make the behavior of the dynamic linkers consistent
     with how they would behave if a cache was not used.

  * Changed ldconfig to cache the symlinks that it finds but
    use the name of the symlink as the soname instead of the 
    actual soname.

ld.so (1.8.8-1) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor documentation updates to reflect recent changes.

  * Changed ld.so and ld-linux.so to perform more complete
    validation on ld.so.cache before using it.

  * Changed ldconfig to accept libraries with inconsistent
    sonames since glibc is going to use them.  A warning is
    still printed in debug mode.

  * Changed the install script to not strip _dl_debug_state
    from ld-linux.so since gdb needs it.

  * More sparc fixes (Derrick Brashear).

  * Changed ldconfig to not issue a warning when a linker
    script disguised as a shared library is found.

  * Fixed a bug in ld-linux.so where some registers were 
    not preserved on the first call to a function causing 
    problems for non-C-like languages (Tim Renouf).

  * Fixed a bug in ld-linux.so where global variables were 
    not always mapped correctly across dynamically loaded 
    libraries (Mikihiko Nakao).

  * Converted to new Debian source packaging format (Shaya
    Potter).
