Xaw version does not automatically scroll karaoke text without user typing
a minimum of 8 characters in the input window (ie. "--------").

svgalib version doesn't properly reset terminal tty mode resulting
in a required ";stty sane" on the end of every command line for splaymidi.
svgalib version may be removed from the distribution soon, barring protest.

X version doesn't handle channel setup on disabled channels that are
re-enabled during playback.  This causes additional bugs specific to the
Gravis Ultrasound.  Pressing the repeat button helps for all but GUS.

Pro Patches lite patch set for gravis ultrasound is reported to have
trouble with linux playmidi.

MT-32 emulation mode (-M) isn't designed to play a file more than once
(ie repeat button), so programs get all screwed up.  Working on a fix.

No other bugs known at this time.
