=====================================================================
Playmidi requires kernel sound driver 3.5 alpha 8 or newer for best
GUS or FM playback.  Any kernel with 3.0.1 or later sound driver
should suffice for midi synth playback (and FM generally).

Email laredo@gnu.ai.mit.edu if interested in becoming a beta tester.

(Dates to right of version number represent public release)

Playmidi 2.3 -- 24 February 1996
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Created a simple Configure script to hopefully end playback problems
people are having because they didn't follow instructions.

Fixed MT-32 program listing thanks to Eric Boon <ericb@cs.kun.nl>

Fixed a bug in playevents.c for handling channel pressure (also could
cause seg faults) -- thanks to Ian McConnell <ian@emit.demon.co.uk>

Fixed CMF file support to actually work, also now loads patches for FM
playback from CMF files if FM playback is selected.

Corrected handling of key signatures for text display to show the
proper major/minor key.

FINALLY fixed 4-OP FM support thanks to kaz!  (I was resetting the FM synth
AFTER switching to 4-op mode which forces a switch back to 2-OP.)

PLEASE NOTE: For CMF files, 4-OP mode has no effect other than to reduce
the total number of voices available since CMF files have only 2-OP patches.

voxware 3.5-alpha8 driver is highly recommended for best FM/GUS playback.

Added a compile-time option for using the GUS Ultra sound driver module
(-DGUS_ULTRA).

Playmidi 2.2 -- 4 January 1996
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed xplaymidi to use Xaw widgets for better appearence and
add more functionality (through user settings of the thousands
of resources available in the XPlaymidi application-defaults file)

For more frequent updates, the system clock and usleep are now
used to time the display updates.  This could cause trouble
if the system load is high, so extremely short waits are still
handled by the sequencer sync ioctl.  Basically all this means
is a more interactive interface at a cost of slightly higher
cpu usage (6%-9% compared with 1.7% previously).

Changed Makefile to install X11 application defaults for xplaymidi.

Changed color assignments for ncurses version.  Channels are easier
to separate since each has its own color.

Fixed chorus to work better at different bender ranges.

Added MT-32 emulation mode for GM playback of MT-32 sequences. (-M)

Added support for playing back archives of midi files from games such
as Ultima 7 and Wing Commander 2 (-hx).  Compile option allows playback of
any random binary file (with unpredictable results, of course).

(Naturally, 4-op FM patches are STILL silent.   I don't know why.)

Playmidi 2.1  -- Private Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~
X11 support started.   "xplaymidi"
SVGALIB support started.   "splaymidi"

As of Linux 1.3.37, FM and GUS pitchbend are both handled perfectly.
Added support for -C chorus setting on Gravis Ultrasound and FM.
(This support is thanks to the pitchbend support in Linux 1.3.37).

Added support for Creative Music Files (CMF) Microsoft RIFF files (RMI)
Currently the first 16 GM instruments are used for CMF files rather than
any FM patches contained in the file.  (FM is not a high priority of mine)
As before, patch assignments may be changed with -p option.

Data structure used in playmidi to store events in a midi file is changed
to a memory-mapped midi file.

There is now a maximum of 128 tracks read in a midi file.  This may be
changed at compile time if you have some really large midi files...
(I'd appreciate a copy of any midi file with more than 128 tracks!)

4-op FM playback is STILL broken.  Any 2-op patch in the 4-op library
should play, but all the 4-op patches are silent.  As mentioned previously,
FM is not a high priority of mine.  Besides, 2-op sounds good with chorus.

This version was a private release

Playmidi 2.0 -- Private Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many bug fixes to 1.9; planned on releasing this one but decided against
it.  Had a tendancy to read past the end of a midi file.

Added support for showing text events on real-time display.   This means
Karaoke files are easily followable.  Each type of text event has its
own color.  Color assignments may change and will be documented later.

readmidi.c is re-written again to be more robust when reading files with
unexpected or missing data.   This allows playback of midi files
when parts of it are missing (while downloading, for example).

Ncurses calls have been simplified for stupid older versions of ncurses.

GUS/FM pitchbend is fixed, but 4-op fm is still broken.

This version was a private release.

Playmidi 1.9 -- Private Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rewrote midi file loading routines.  Rewrote display routines -- now using
ncurses for interaction in order to be portable to other terminals and
support a ^L repaint screen option.  Display routines were split to a
separate source file in order to facilitate addition of X11 interface.

This version is fully interractive.   It polls the keyboard for all
interaction between every midi wait.

Added options -R and -C to set initial midi Reverb and Chorus.

Removed support for /dev/sequencer2 (/dev/music now) since it is still
full of bugs even in the 3.0.1 voxware release.  I needed more control
of GUS and FM anyway for implementing software reverb, chorus, and 
modulation-wheel effects in future versions.

4-Op FM still seems broken, same with GUS/FM pitch-bend.

This version was a private release.

Playmidi 1.2 -- 26 June 1995
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alex Mohr, dzur@u.washington.edu, assorted bug fixes.
Please note that I have no idea how this beast actually deals with
the sound driver.  I just found the places that caused the program
to die horribly and fixed them up a bit, so if you have problems
with this software, don't bug me about them.  :)

[PLEASE NOTE:
 From November 1994 to August 1995 I was unable to support playmidi
 due to contractual obligations with the United States Government.
 It was changed by Alex without my permission in my absence, and I
 do not retain his changes in my source.  Sorry, Alex. -- NIL]

Playmidi 1.1 -- 20 November 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the first public release of playmidi.  Playmidi 1.0
was a private release.

This version is full of bugs, and 4-op FM is totally broken.
GUS/FM pitchbend is disabled (bender range set to 16 cents).
