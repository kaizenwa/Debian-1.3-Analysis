I have used some code from other people to write XPlaycd, many thanks to all
of you.

The file hardware.c and struct.c are taken from WorkBone, and there
taken from WorkMan I think.

The file cd.c was written by referring to WorkBone.

The Look-and-Feel of the programs was taken from 'xvolume for rplay'
by using and modifying the files which came with it. xvolume was written
by Andrew S. Scherpbier.

Morgan Antonsson <d0antmo@dtek.chalmers.se> sent me a better shuffle algorithm.

If I have used some other free code, and forgot to mention it, tell me, I will
add it to this file to give the proper credits!

Special thanks to Frank Pilcher for beta-testing the stuff.
