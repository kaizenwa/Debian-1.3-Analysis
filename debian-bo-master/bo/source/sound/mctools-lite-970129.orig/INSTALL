 CONFIGURING, COMPILING AND INSTALLING MCTOOLS-BASED X-SOFTWARE
----------------------------------------------------------------

The software in this directory needs the McTools library. If you don't see
a directory named McTools or no files named `config-dist.h' or `build', you
will have to get and unpack the appropriate McTools-xxxxxx.tar.gz file first.

All subdirectories in this directory which begin with a capital letter contain
some McTools-based X-software. To learn more about those programs, see the
appropriate README.xxx file.

To build and install do this:

1) Copy config-dist.h to config.h and edit it to reflect your preferences.

2) type  ./build all            to compile everything.
   type  ./build <dir>          to compile programs in dir <dir>.

3) type  ./build install        to install everything as specified in config.h.
   type  ./build install <dir>  to install programs in dir <dir>.

Type   ./build --help   to see more options.


 CONFIGURING, COMPILING AND INSTALLING OTHER SOFTWARE IN THIS DIRECTORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

All other subdirectories (that is, not beginning with a capital) contain non
X-based software which is needed for some of the X-based programs above.

To install one of them, cd to the subdirectory and hope to find a README
there... ;)



Have fun,
