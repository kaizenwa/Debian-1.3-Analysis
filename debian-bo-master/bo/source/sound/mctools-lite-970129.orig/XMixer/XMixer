!
! If you set this to on, XMixer will periodically poll the mixer device and
! update the display, so you can see changes even if they are made by other
! programs.
! Polling will not cause a big system load, however, it keeps the program
! always in memory, so this is probably not a good idea if you are low.
! The pollRate is specified in microseconds, thus this example means three
! times per sec.

!
! You may enable/disable each slider separately.
! If none of the following resources are set, the default is to
! enable everything.
! XMixer will, however, check for each slider whether it is supported by
! the sound driver. Each unsupported slider will silently be disabled if not.
! Use '*debug: on' if you are unsure.
