- Far too many changes to everything, including the lib, I didn't leave a
  brick on top of another...
- Added support for gadget-tips (Those little windows which annoyingly
  pop up if you stop the mouse over a button). Very handy on the Tracklist,
  as the tips show the name of it.
- Removed support for raw scsi device. The linux kernel now supports a
  CDROMCLOSETRAY ioctl. However, this is still somewhat buggy in both
  the kernel and xplaycd.
- Munched xmdb and xplaycd code into one directory
- Wrote an Imakefile

- Changelog started (far too late, but...)
- checkmount() now checks for the device beeing mounted, rather than for
  any iso9660 filesystem. XPlaycd now works with more than one drive.
  (Thanks to Dirk Försterling)
- Fixed memory leak in read_db() (Thanks to Eric van der Maarel)
- Added support for raw scsi device. On scsi cdroms which support it,
  the tray may be loaded under software control.
