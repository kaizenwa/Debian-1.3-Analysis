! Normally you have to press eject whenever you place a new cd in the drive to
! tell XPlaycd about it.
! If you set this resource to on, XPlaycd will poll the drive in intervals of
! one second and will detect a new cd itself. On some systems this will spew
! nasty messages into the syslog like 'Make sure there is a disc in the drive'
! so the option is off by default.

!
! *useMixer can be set to:
! <id>         =  If your cdrom is connected to a soundcard, you may have
!                 to specify which soundcard input is used. Sane values are
!                 usually: cd, line, line1, line2 or line3.
!                 For completeness, here is the complete list:
!                 vol bass treble synth pcm speaker line mic cd mix pcm2 rec
!                 igain ogain line1 line2 line3
! auto         =  Works like `cd' if mixerDevice is available, works like off
!                 if not. (This is the default)
! off          =  Control the volume directly at the drive. Some drives do
!                 not support this (e.g. Mediavision CDR-H93MV).
!*useMixer:	auto

!
! The mixer device, this is only needed if you don't define *useMixer to 'off'.
!
!*mixerDevice:	/dev/mixer

! This is the devicename of your cdrom. Usually this is defined as /dev/cdrom
! which is a symbolic link to the real device. But you may also enter the
! device directly, the first linux scsi drive would be /dev/sr0.
!
!*cdromDevice:	/dev/cdrom

! Some scsi cdroms are able to load the tray under software control.
! For this to work, the kernel must have scsi generic support enabled,
! and the raw scsi device must be accesible under your user id.
! BEWARE! GIVING WORLD ACCESS TO A RAW SCSI DEVICE MAY BE A SECURITY LEAK!
! Be sure to read the manpage!

!*scsiDevice:	/dev/sga


! The path where xplaycd expects the database. XPlaycd searches this
! directory and all subdirectories of it.
! You are encouraged to change this to some place where you have write access.

!*cddb:		/usr/local/lib/cddb

! This is an additional read-only database, which may be maintained by someone
! else. XPlaycd searches this directory and all subdirectories of it.
