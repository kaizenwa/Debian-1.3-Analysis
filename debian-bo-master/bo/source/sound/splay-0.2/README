several formats, notably the MPEG audio and Wave format. This early version
has only limited functionally and a simplistic user interface. For the moment,
only Intel pc's running Linux are supported.

This program have NO WARRANTY.

Now, threaded playing and 'Force to mono' are implemented.
And implemented poor shuffle play.
