MPEG/WAVE player library Version 0.2

To know what are changed, see sound/ChangeLog

This library uses part from vplay, maplay 1.2 for linux, maplay 1.2+ for Win95.

WHAT IT IS
  This is sound player for Linux, without ANY WARRANY. In 1996, I've upgraded 
maplay 1.2 to use the wave format. Recently, maplay 1.2+ was released, but it
did not support Linux. I modified maplay 1.2+ to support Linux. but id did not
work as my system lack sufficient power(Pentium-60 with FDIV bug). 
Since, I have made it faster by optimizing a number of function and using
inline assembler. The new version works on a Pentium-60 with 32MB, but I have
yet to test with other machines. Please tell me how well it works with other
configurations.
  At version 0.2, I added thread and 'force to mono' functions.
'force to mono' will make system faster. And thread make player smoother.
My skill on thread is so poor. Then it may be unstable.
  Please install pthread. Although it is under beta testing. It's useful.

WITHOUT pthread
  Comment out TFLASG, TLIBFLASG in Makefile

CAUTION
  It's not for general UNIX, only for Intel CPU (little endian)

  For example;
   unsigned char a[4]={0x11,0x22,0x33,0x44};
   unsigned int *b=(unsigned int *)&a;

	Little endian (Intel) : 0x44332211
	Big    endian         : 0x11223344

   The classes 'bitwindow' and 'bitstream' are endian dependent.

  I have exploited the linear properties of 2 and 3 dimensional arrays.
  like for example;

    int a[4][4];

    a[1][0]==a[0][4] is true.

  Of course, It may occur boundary problem. But it may make player faster!


ENGLISH PROBLEM
  I release README with International(English) and Korean(My native language). 
The Korean version should be ok, but the english version have many spelling
mistakes and confusing words and sentences. Please forgive me and help me
correct the english.

PROBLEM?
  Please send me bug report or fixed version.(Please comment where is changed)
