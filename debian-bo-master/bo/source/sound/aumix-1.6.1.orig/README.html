<h1>aumix 1.6.1 README</h1>
<hr><p>

This is an audio mixer which can be used from the command line or scripts,
or interactively at the console or a terminal with a full-screen,
ncurses-based interface. <a
href="http://www.rz.go.dlr.de:8081/unix/src/misc/ncurses-1.9.9e.tar.gz">Version
1.9.9e of the ncurses libraries</a> is recommended. This version of aumix
can be compiled with or without GPM mouse support, for which libgpm is
needed. <a
href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Daemons/gpm-1.10.tar.gz">
Version 1.10</a> is recommended.  You will need the sound driver in your
kernel or as a module.

<p>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>
<h3>Precompiled:</h3>
<p>
Do
<p>
<code>make install</code>
<p>
to install the 486 ELF binary into <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and the
man page into <code>/usr/local/man/man1</code>.  The precompiled binary was prepared with gcc 2.7.2.1 using the command:
<p>
<code>
gcc -o aumix aumix.c -lncurses -lgpm -s -Wall -DNCURSES -DGPM -O6 -m486
-fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -pipe -malign-jumps=2
</code>
<p>
and is linked to libncurses.so.3.0, libgpm.so.1, and libc.so.5.
<p>
<h3>Roll-Your-Own:</h3>
<p>
To compile, edit <code>Makefile</code> and comment out <code>-DGPM</code>
or both that and <code>-DNCURSES</code> from <code>OPTS</code> if you
wish to disable either GPM support or full-screen mode respectively.  If
you do this, also comment out <code>-lgpm</code> or both that and
<code>-lncurses</code> from the LIBS line. Then do
<p>
<code>make clean install</code>
<p>
which removes the precompiled binaries, builds new ones, places them in
<code>/usr/local/bin</code>, and places the man page in
<code>/usr/local/man/man1</code> (change <code>BINDIR</code> and
<code>MANDIR</code> in <code>Makefile</code> if you want them elsewhere). 
<p>
<h2>Changes:</h2>
<p><ul>
<p>
<h3>New in version 1.6.1:</h3><p>
<li>fixed problem with conditional compilation
<p>
<h3>New in version 1.6:</h3><p>
<li>ability to save settings to a file and load them in again
<li>option to use a restricted character set in interactive mode, when IBM
graphic characters are not available
<li>support for second mixer
<li>changed meaning of "&#60" and "&#62" keys (now same as Tab or Enter)
<li>"," and "." function synonymously with "&#60" and "&#62" so users need not
shift when using US keyboard
<li>prettified device names removed, to save space and to allow for future
changes to the sound driver
<li>added labels for banks of level and balance controls
<li>fixed bug with record/play indicators
<li>record/play information updated more often
<li>record/play information gets printed on query
<p>
<h3>New in version 1.5:</h3><p>
<li>"q" options for command line to print settings without changing
<li>command-line section modularized for compactness
<li>widened controls in interactive mode for greater precision in setting and reading
<li>balance controls get redrawn after levels adjusted
<li>added command-line options for imix, altpcm, reclev, igain, ogain, line1, line2 and line3
<p>
<h3>New in version 1.4:</h3><p>
<li>mouse support and interactive mode now optional
<li>added balance controls to interactive mode
<li>changed layout of interactive mode
<li>improved error messages
<li>bass, treble, synth and mic devices can be set from the command line
<li>should work better when multiple instances, or other mixer programs,
are running
<p>
<h3>New in version 1.3:</h3><p>
<li>added mouse support by incorporating code from rmev.c by Alessandro
Rubini (packaged with gpm) 
<li>changed color of controls from white to cyan/green so the mouse cursor
would be more visible
<li>added Quit button for use with mouse
<li>added "Q" key to quit from program
<li>removed use of two different graphic characters to show controls in
use or not in use, because it didn't make sense with both the mouse and
keyboard being usable
<li>added man page
<p>
<h3>New in version 1.2:</h3><p>
<li>two banks of horizontal controls, no special treatment of volume,
bass, and treble (layout idea borrowed from <a
href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu//pub/Linux/apps/sound/mixers/cam-1.02.tgz">
CAM</a>), so labels don't have to be jammed together
<li>record/play indicators now show the letters "R" and "P" rather than
just a red or green square, so they should be more self-explanatory and
more monochrome-friendly
<li>added use of "[" and "]" keys to set controls to 0% or 100%
<li>changed effect of up and down curser keys so they go from one control to 
another
<p>
<h3>New in version 1.1:</h3><p>
<li> fewer colors and no border to simplify full-screen interface
<li> knobs are highlighted as you move to them, then brighten and
leave a trail behind when you adjust them
<li> controls which won't work are no longer drawn, to simplify the
display
<li> horizontal knobs now drawn with same characters as vertical ones
<li> vertical controls spaced more closely so they fit in 80
columns
<li> added use of "<" and ">" for cursor motion, and "q" to quit program
<li> use of tab, "+" and "-" keys now shown on help line
<li> added -h option to display usage
<li> Makefile changed so that optimization flags are user-defined and
dbmeter is installed
<p>
<h3>New in version 1.0:</h3>
<p>
<li> added command-line interface
<p>
<h3>New in version 0.2:</h3>
<p>
<li> doesn't assume existence of any device (volume, bass, etc)
<li> some bug fixes to work correctly with SB Pro
<li> should now work correctly when multiple copies are run simutaneously
<li> some minor bug fixes
</ul>
<p>
<h2>To Do:</h2>
<p><ul>
<p>
<li>X11 interface
<li>multilingual documentation
<li>packaging for Debian and Red Hat
<li>ports to various operating systems
<li>world domination
</ul><hr>
