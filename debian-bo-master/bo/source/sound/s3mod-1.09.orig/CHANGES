************** CHANGES *****************
CHANGES for v1.05 to v1.08, March 6, 1995 (DJ)

1. Made the "GUS" sections conditionally compiled in
2. Found a incorrectly declared variables (MAX_TRACKS->MAX_SAMPLES)
   which was causing problems for the GUS.
3. Integrated Ricky Beam's SUN and DEC patches. I have been
   able to test and use the SUN support, the DEC I have not, 
   your mileage may vary.

CHANGES for v1.04 to v1.05, May 5, 1994 (DJ)

1. Organized the code. (DJ)
2. beattrack was changed to be able to drive both period and pitch
   driven sound drivers. It was also taken out of updatetracks();
   and moved to the "play_mod_xx" level. 
3. GUS native support added. (DJ)
4. Added new command line argument parsing code. (DM)
5. Added NTSC/PAL speed adjustment.

CHANGES for v1.02 to v1.04, May 5, 1994

1. fixed bug in repeat length fix for mods that have 
   repeat length of sample > sample length
2. Use correct blocksize for card now, so Gravis Ultrasound
   works correctly.
3. Added loud/normal volume tables
4. Consolidated beattrack_s3m and beattrack so that the
   code was smaller, and made more sense.
5. Got rid of pitchtable and now I use division to calculate
   pitch rates for mods.
6. Added quiet mode so that nothing is printed
7. Added non-looping variable

CHANGES from v1.00 to v1.02

1. fixed for instrument size in s3m's > 24000 bytes

3. hopefully fixed gravis ultrasound support
4. added endian awareness
5. added more effects to get_track_s3m()
6. fixed fast sample rate (thank you, stevenl@ccnet.ccnet.com)
