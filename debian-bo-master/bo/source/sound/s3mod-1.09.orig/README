This is s3mod for Linux. It is a MOD/S3M tracker file player.  This
should play 4,6,or 8 track MOD file format tracker files. It also
should play Scream Tracker 3 (S3M) files.

Email any bugs you find to
				jeske@uiuc.edu
				or
				s3mod@uiuc.edu

We know that 16bit /dev/dsp support is not as clean as it should/could
be. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let us know.

******** ADDING PLATFORM SUPPORT ********

We've tried to make it as easy as possible to add support for new
platforms. First you'll need to add a new entry to the makefile. Here
is a template:

your_platform:
	$(RM) dsp.c
	$(LN) DspDrivers/your_platform.c dsp.c
	make CC=cc CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS="-lyour_audio_lib"

Any new defines you need set, you should put ont the MAKE command line.
Now, you'll need to make a your_platform.c file for the dsp calls. This
should go in the "DspDrivers" directory. Use the "stereo" and "bit16"
global variables to control your setup of the DSP device.

int get_dsp_device(void) 
void write_dsp_device(void *buf, int size) 
void close_dsp_device(void)

Then you may want to take a look at and add some stuff to config.h.

When stereo is used, the samples will be interleaved for you. If you
need them uninterleaved, then you'll have to either do it yourself,
or you'll have to write a new mixer in "mix.c". 


******** THANKS TO: *********

Thanks to the authors of GMOD. It was essential in my learning to
understand the /dev/sequencer "VoxWare" drivers.
	( Hannu Savolainen and Andrew J. Robinson )

Thanks to Carlos Hasan for releasing source to his mod player.

Thanks also to those who wrote Vangelis Tracker, and for those at
Future Crew for making the S3M file format. Lastly, thanks to Skaven
and Purple Motion of Future Crew for releasing so many great S3Ms to
listen to.

Some internal thanks to Brandon Long (blong@uiuc.edu) for initiating
the port of this to Linux and now SUN.

Recent Thanks to Ricky Beam (cramer@catt.ncsu.edu) for providing SUN
/dev/audio and DEC AF sound support.

Thanks to Mike Muuss <mike@arl.mil> for the SGI support.

Thanks to Brandon Long (blong@uiuc.edu) for fixin the Solaris support 
and restructuring the platform support.
