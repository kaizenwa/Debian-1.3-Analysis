================================================================
    AWE32 Sound Driver Utility Programs for Linux / FreeBSD
		version 0.3.3; Mar. 17, 1997
================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------
* CAUTION

The control of instrument search mode for multiple instrument layers
is added on sfxload and txt2sfx utilities.  In the older versions
the first instrument was used (-m 0), but now all the istruments are
merged (-m 2) as default.  This may cause a little difference from
the sounds on older drivers.  If you want to keep the older one,
specify -m 0 manually. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
* SFXLOAD

Sfxload transfers both the sound information and sample data to the
AWE sound driver.  Sfxload can the original SoundFont (SF2) file and
the converted SFX file (see txt2sfx).

	% sfxload [options] SF2file
	% sfxload [options] SFXfile [SF2file]

	options: [-IixBvs] [-m mode] [-b bank] [-c chorus] [-r reverb]
		 [-V volume] [-P path1:path2..]

The first usage is to read SF2 (or SBK) file directly and convert it
inside the sfxload utility and transfer to the awe driver.
In the latter case, sfxload reads the converted information in SFX
file and sample data in SoundFont file (if necessary), and transfer
them.  If instruments in the sfx file use only ROM samples or sample
waves are included in SFX file (by using -d in txt2sfx), no SoundFont
file is required.

The sound files are searched through the path list given by the
environment variable SFBANKDIR or the command line option -P.
The file extension .sfx, .sf2, and .sbk can be abbreviated.

The command option '-I' means to initialize AWE32 again.  This is
occasionally necessary when sample tranfer fails frequently.

The option '-i' means to clean up all samples on driver.  The option
'-x' means to remove only the last loaded samples.  Otherwise, samples
are appended after the last sample.

The option '-B' means to add 48 size of blank loop on each sample
data.  To be compatible with older sfxload, specify this option.

The options '-c' and '-r' specify the effects of chorus and reverb,
respectively.  The value is from 0 to 100.  The default is zero.
Note: these values may be overwritten by MIDI control messages.

The option '-v' means to increase verbosity level.  You can check the
maximum number of samples and instruments using this option.  More -v
cause more verbose outputs.

The option '-m' is used to change the instrument search mode for
multiple defined instruments: 0=first, 1=last, and 2=merge(default)
modes, respectively.  If this options is 0, only the first instrument
is used and other instruments in the same preset are ignored.
If this is 1, the last instrument is used instead.  Otherwise, all the
instruments in the preset are merged.

The option '-b' is used to replace bank number of default bank samples 
(bank 0).  This option is necessary to load user bank, usually in bank 
one.

eg)
	% sfxload -i -r 30 -c 40 gm.sfx
	% sfxload -b 1 surprise.sf2

The option '-V' specifies the total volume of sounds, provided in percent.
Default volume is 70%.

The option '-P' specifies the search path for sound files.
It overrides the environment SFBANKDIR.

----------------------------------------------------------------
* GUSLOAD

Gusload is a tool to load a GUS compatible patch file to AWE32 driver.

	% gusload [-iIxv] [-b bank] [-p preset] GUSfile

The options are almost compatible with sfxload utility.
The voices are loaded as a preset with the prescribed instrument
number in each patch unless -p option is specified.
The bank number is also changed by -b option.

eg)
	% gusload -b 0 -p 53 doo.pat


----------------------------------------------------------------
* SF2TEXT

Sf2text (aka sbktext) converts the specified SoundFont file to the
text file which is editable easily.  Both SBK and SF2 formats can be
converted.

	% sf2text sample.sf2 sample.txt

The converted text file contains five categories.

1. major and minor versions
2. sample data position and size
3. preset information
4. instrument information
5. sample data information

If the line start with '#' letter, this line is skipped as comments.

The awesfx package doesn't provide SBK to SF2 conversion tool, but
txt2sfx and sfxload can read and convert SBK format correcly now.
But if you want to convert to SF2, you need CreativeLabs' SF1TO2.EXE
utility program for DOS.  Fortunately, this program can run under
dosemu.


----------------------------------------------------------------
* TXT2SFX

Txt2sfx converts the text file to the SFX file, which is required for
loading on AWE sound driver.  Both SBK and SF2 formats can be parsed
from this release.

	% txt2sfx [-v] [-m mode] [-d sbk or sf2file] sample.txt sample.sfx

The option -v means verbose mode.
The option -m is identical with one in sfxload.
The option -d specifies SoundFont file, if you want to include sample
data in the SFX file itself.


----------------------------------------------------------------
* SFXTEST

Sfxtest is a sample program to control awe sound driver.

	% sfxtest commands ...

For example, to play a trumpet voice (preset 56) on key middle C (60)
for two seconds in channel access mode, execute as follows:

	% sfxtest X p 56 n 60 127 t 200 K 60

You can see the debug message of the awe driver by setting debug
mode.

	% sfxtest X D 9 p 47 n 62 100 t 150 K 47 D 0

Multiple channels can be used at the same time.

	% sfxtest X x 0 p 0 n 60 127 x 1 p 5 n 72 110 t 150 x 0 K 60 x 1 K 72


----------------------------------------------------------------
* GUS2SFX

Gus2sfx is a converter from GUS patch file to SFX file.
Specify a GUS patch file, the SFX filename to be converted, and the
bank and preset numbers (digit) of this instrument.

	% gus2sfx gusshot.pat gunshot.sfx 0 127
