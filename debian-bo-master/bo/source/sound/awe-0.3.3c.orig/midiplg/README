================================================================

* GENERAL NOTES

This is a plug-in for Netscape 3.0 navigator to play MIDI files
embedded in web pages like Crescendo or Yamaha MIDI Plugin.
The ver.0.3 (beta) supports the control panel including "play",
"stop" and "pause" buttons.

The source package includes source files from Netscape Plugin
Developer Kit (3.0b5).


* REQUIREMENTS

- Netscape 3.0 navigator
- AWE32 driver & utils ver.0.3.1 or newer
- drvmidi program ver.0.3.1 or newer
- Xaw library (for pluging with control panel)


* INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE PACKAGE

- Extract source package

- Edit Makefile

  + PLUGIN_DIR is the directory the plug-in binary npmidi.so will be
  installed.  (npxmidi.so is not created from this version.)

  + Turn on PLUGIN_DEBUG defintion if want to trace the log message from 
  MIDI plug-in.  The messaged is logged on /tmp/midiplg.log.

  + SHLIBDIR and EXTRA_LOAD_FLAGS are necessary for X11 library.  This 
  is derived from XFree86-3.2 configuration.  If you installed your
  X-Window system on some other directory, change these definitions.

  + If you want a plug-ing without graphical control panel, use
  Makefile.nopanel instead.  The contorl panel plug-ing causes a bus
  error on some specific situations (see known bugs).  In such a case, 
  use no-panel plug-in.  Since the program names are different, you
  can install both plug-in programs on the same netscape directory.
  Then choose apropriate type from general options menu (see below).

- Run "make install"


* INSTALLATION FROM BINARY PACKAGE

Copy npmidi.so to plug-in directory.
The system plug-in directory is usually
	/usr/local/lib/netscape/plugins
Or, users can have their own directory,
	~/.netscape/plugins
npmidi-nopanel.so is a plug-in without control panel window.
Copy this on the same directory, too.


* USING NETSCAPE

Start Netscape navigator, and check the helper list from General
Options in Options menu.  You'll see new items with audio/midi and
audio/x-midi.  If not, something wrong in installation.  Please check
that the plugins are copied properly.

If you use some proxy servers like Delegate, and you see messages like
"no plug-in for text/html mime type..", this is because of incorrect
ftp transfer via proxy server.  These servers change ftp connection to 
http connection with text/html header, so Netscape is confused.
In such a case, turn off proxy caching.


* KNOWN BUGS

- Netscape crashes (bus error) when trying to display a directory from
  the page with MIDI control panel.  It happen even when back to the
  previous page.
