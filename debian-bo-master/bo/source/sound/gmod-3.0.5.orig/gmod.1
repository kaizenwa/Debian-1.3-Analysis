.TH GMOD 1 "1996 Mar 03" "Version 2.3" "USER APPLICATIONS"
.SH NAME
gmod \- play music modules
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gmod
[\-bcehlnqrRsxz] [\-m mixer] [\-P pan-factor] [\-v volume] [module...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents
.BR gmod ,
a music module file player for Linux and the Gravis Ultrasound card.
.B Gmod
is capable of playing 669, MOD, Multitracker (MTM), Scream Tracker III (S3M),
Ultratracker (ULT), and FastTracker (XM) files.
.PP
Modules compressed with \fBcompress\fP, \fBgzip\fP, \fBlharc\fP, or
\fBzip\fP can be played by
.BR gmod ,
if gunzip, lharc, and/or zip are installed.
.PP
The modules will be played in the order specified on the command line.  The
following keys can be used while the module is playing, unless the
.I "\-z"
option was specified (special keys -- arrows, etc -- only work if gmod was
compiled with ncurses support):
.TP
.I "b, left arrow"
Move backwards <numeric argument> positions.
.TP
.I "f, right arrow"
Move forward <numeric argument> positions.
.TP
.I "n, next page"
Next module.
.TP
.I "p, previous page"
Previous module.
.TP
.I "q"
Quit.
.TP
.I "+"
Increase sequencer volume by <numeric argument>.
.TP
.I "-"
Decrease sequencer volume by <numeric argument>.
.TP
.I "up arrow"
Scroll sample list up.
.TP
.I "down arrow"
Scroll sample list down.
.TP
.I "0..9"
Set numeric argument.  For example, keying 1 0 will set the numeric argument
to 10.  The argument will remain in effect until a command which uses the
argument is executed and a new argument is entered.  For example, 10ff will
advance 20 positions, and 10f5f will advance 15 positions.
.PP
In addition,
.B gmod
understands the following signals:
.TP
.I "SIGTERM"
Quit.
.TP
.I "SIGUSR1"
Previous module.
.TP
.I "SIGUSR2"
Next module.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-b"
(MOD only) Disable BPM tempos.  Specifying this option will cause
.B gmod
to treat all speed commands as changes to the number of ticks per note.
.TP
.B "\-c"
Disable compression of modules in memory.  Normally, modules are compressed
in memory in order to use less space.  Specifying this option will save some
CPU time.
.TP
.B "\-e"
Show empty samples.  Use this option to display information about all
samples in a module, even if some are empty.  (Not supported for S3M modules).
This option only works if gmod was compiled without ncurses support.
.TP
.B "\-h"
Display help.
.TP
.B "\-l"
Break infinite pattern loops in modules.
.TP
.B "\-m \fImixer\fP"
Use mixer number
.IR mixer .
.B Gmod
will attempt to use /dev/mixer if this option is not specified.
Specifying this option will cause
.B gmod
to use /dev/mixer\fIn\fP, where
.I n
is the specified mixer.  Valid values are 0 to 15.
.TP
.B "\-n"
(MOD only) Use NTSC sample timing.  This option should be used with modules
composed on NTSC (non-European) machines.
.TP
.B "\-P \fIpan-factor\fP"
Set the panning factor.  Valid values are -100 to 100.  Higher absolute values
produce more panning.  Negative values cause the left/right channels to be
swapped. The default value is 100.
.TP
.B "\-q"
Quiet mode.  No text output will be produced.
.TP
.B "-r"
Infinitely repeat the current module.
.TP
.B "-R"
Randomize the play order of the modules.
.TP
.B "-s"
(MOD only) Ignore "speed 0" commands.  Ordinarily, "speed 0" commands cause
playing to stop.  Use this option if a module seems to suddenly stop in the
middle.
.TP
.B "-v \fIvolume\fP"
Set the volume to
.I volume.
Valid values are 0 to 255.  The default value is 255.
.TP
.B "-x"
(MOD only) Extend octaves.  Normally, the range of notes in modules is limited
to what is specified by the standard.  This option removes that restriction.
.TP
.B "-z"
Background mode.  This option does not put
.B gmod
in the background; rather, it
allows
.B gmod
to run in the background.  The keys that can be normally used
while a module is playing no longer work, and the display of the current
position and pattern is disabled.
.TP
.B "-5"
(MOD only) Use 50 Hz clock frequency.  Specifying this option will cause speed
changes to be calculated using a 50 Hz frequency base.  The default value is
60 Hz.
.SH THE GMODRC FILE
The gmodrc file is used to determine settings to be used for particular
modules.  GMOD will first look for a file named .gmodrc in the user's home
directory, and if it is not found, it will look for /usr/etc/gmodrc.  The gmodrc
settings are combined with the options given on the command line.  The format of
the file is:
.PP
filename(without path) option ...
.PP
For example, if mymodule.mod uses NTSC sample timing and speed 0 commands
should be ignored, the following line could be entered in the gmodrc file:
.PP
mymodule.mod ntsc nospeed0
.PP
Spacing is not important, but case is significant.  The module name must start
at the leftmost position of the line.  The length of the line is limited to
160 characters.
.PP
Valid options are (corresponding command-line options are in parenthesis):
nobpm (-b), ntsc (-n), nospeed0 (-s), extend (-x), and 50hz (-5)
.SH NOTES
This applies only if gmod is compiled without linear volume support:
Setting the sequencer volume to anything greater than approximately 60 when
gmod's volume
.I "(\-v)"
is set to 255 will cause volume clipping.  Lower gmod volumes will allow higher
sequencer volumes before clipping occurs.
.PP
MOD files use various timing methods.  Different methods and the corresponding
options are listed below:
.PP
NTSC (60 Hz) CIA:  -n
.PP
PAL (50 Hz) CIA:  no options (default)
.PP
NTSC (60 Hz) Vblank:  -bn
.PP
PAL (50 Hz) Vblank:  -b5
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit codes are:
.TP
0
Normal termination.
.TP
50
Bad arguments.
.TP
51
An error occurred while attempting to access the sequencer.
.TP
52
An error occurred while attempting to load a module
.TP
53
No GUS card was found.
