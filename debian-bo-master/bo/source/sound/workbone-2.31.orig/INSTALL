1) WorkBone expects to find the device: /dev/cdrom . If you don't
   have this device, change to /dev and soft link your current
   cd rom device to 'cdrom'. For example, if you currently call
   your cdrom device 'mcd0', then do the following:

               cd /dev
               ln -sf mcd0 cdrom

   Alternatively, just edit line 46 of 'hardware.c'  to reflect the
   name of your cdrom device. 
   
2) The Makefile defines owner and group for man pages as 'daemon'. You
   may redefine these to your taste at lines 14 and 15 of the Makefile.

3) Type 'make'

4) If all went well, type 'make install'

5) Read the man page
