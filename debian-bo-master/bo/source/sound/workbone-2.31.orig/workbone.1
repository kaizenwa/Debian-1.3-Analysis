.SH DESCRIPTION
.B WorkBone
is an interactive TEXT-MODE program for playing audio CDs
under Linux. It is implemented as an interface to the module "hardware.c"
from the elaborate X11 CD program known as WorkMan. 
.PP
By 
.I
design, 
the
.B WorkBone
.I
utility
is an 
.I
intentionally
minimalist CD control panel. A clear 
template is displayed to guide you. 
Extraneous features of the X11 WorkMan such as shuffle play and
CD databases are 
.I 
intentionally
not supported. The aesthetic appeal of simplicity
versus features and bloat has been our design goal.
.B WorkBone
is ideal for those who just want to play music with minimal fuss.
.br
.SH USAGE
.B WorkBone
expects to find the device: /dev/cdrom . If you don't
have this device, change to /dev and soft link your current
cd rom device to 'cdrom'. For example, if you currently call
your cdrom device 'mcd0', then do the following:
.sp
               cd /dev
               ln -sf mcd0 cdrom
.PP
Alternatively, just edit 'hardware.c'  to reflect the
name of your cdrom device and recompile. 
.PP
.B WorkBone
uses the numeric keypad as a control panel to allow you
to move track to track, play, pause, stop, and resume playing of
audio CDs. Make sure you have your NUM LOCK engaged when using
.B WorkBone.
A graphical template is displayed to guide you. Running times
are also continuously updated and displayed. 
Note that total CD elapsed time includes times for non-audio data
tracks in addition to playable tracks.  Pushing the
DEL key on the numeric pad will bring up a help screen.

HARDWARE
.B WorkBone
works with my Mitsumi FX001D CD Rom drive, but your
mileage with other drives may vary. In particular, some
CD Rom drives such as
.I
NEC
use proprietary non-standard audio routines.
.B WorkBone
itself uses only generic calls and
functions as per WorkMan proper. The display code
was written specifically for the Linux console.
Portability was not a concern. :-) However,
the `-a' option will put 
.B WorkBone
into the 7-bit mode for use
with any terminal.

BUGS
.B WorkBone
has been tested with Linux kernel 1.0.9 and late versions
of kernel 1.1.x. 
.B WorkBone
might not display the template properly
on early versions of 1.1.x. The fix is to upgrade your kernel or
use 
.B WorkBone's
`-a' flag to enable ascii 7-bit characters. 
.PP
Note that 
.I
some
.B
NEC 
CD drives 
.I
do not work properly 
because they use their own proprietary
audio routines. 
.PP
Please e-mail any bug reports, fixes or improvements that
you might have. 
.B
Unauthorized hacks
and un-coordinated releases of 
.B WorkBone
are 
.B
not appreciated!
