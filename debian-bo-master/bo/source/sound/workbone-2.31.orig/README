  WorkBone Version 2.3 -- official release
  --------------------
  
  WorkBone is covered under the provisions of the GNU GPL. While you
  may incorporate routines from WorkBone into your own projects,
  please DO NOT release your creation under the WorkBone name.
  Unfortunately, some individuals have released unapproved hacks using
  the WorkBone name.  These uncoordinated hacks have caused headaches
  and confusion for the author, contributors, and end users of the
  legitimate WorkBone. If you wish to contribute to official WorkBone
  development, feel free to send your comments, suggestions, or patches
  to the author for possible inclusion into the official release.

  WorkBone is an interactive TEXT-MODE control panel for playing audio
  CDs under Linux. It is text-mode interface to the module
  "hardware.c" from the elaborate X11 CD program known as WorkMan.
  WorkBone is intended as a simple interactive tool for navigating
  audio CDs under text-mode Linux. WorkBone intentionally does not
  incorporate extraneous features of WorkMan.  In fact, WorkBone is
  designed for those individuals who just wish to play music simply
  and with minimal fuss, and without the bloat of excessive features.

  WorkBone uses the numeric keypad as a control panel to allow you
  to move track to track, play, stop, pause, and resume playing of
  audio CDs. Additionally, the running times are continuously updated
  and displayed. Make sure you have your NUM LOCK engaged when using
  WorkBone. A template is displayed to guide you, and pushing the
  DEL key on the numeric pad will bring up a help screen.

  Note that WorkBone works with most CD Rom drives. However some
  NEC drives use non-standard proprietary audio commands, and 
  WorkBone will not function with these non-standard drives.

  Thanks go to the folks who originally wrote WorkMan, the X11 cd
  player. Many thank to Phil Hughes who fixed the man page. And
  much appreciation to Sam Honeybone, David La Croix, Tim Norman, and
  Alan Jenkins, all who have provided useful fixes, code, hints, and 
  suggestions.
  
  Enjoy.
