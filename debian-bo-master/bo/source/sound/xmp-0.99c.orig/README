xmp is a module player for Linux written by Claudio Matsuoka and Hipolito
Carraro Jr. and supports the Gravis Ultrasound and AWE-32 hardware mixers.
The file README.formats contains more information about the supported (and
partially supported) module formats.

This product has absolutely NO WARRANTY. Use it at your own risk, the
authors disclaim any responsibility for kernel panics, hardware meltdowns,
disk crashes or any kind of lossage. It worked in our tests but your
milleage may (and probably will) vary.

The latest version can be found at http://allchemy.iq.usp.br/~claudio/xmp
or ftp://ftp.brasil.enemy.org/users/claudio/xmp. Send bug reports, comments
and suggestions to claudio@cpgei.cefetpr.br. I'm also including a FAQ in
this release, feel free to read it :)

Do whatever you want with the sources, but send me a mail first if you
want to distribute modified versions.
