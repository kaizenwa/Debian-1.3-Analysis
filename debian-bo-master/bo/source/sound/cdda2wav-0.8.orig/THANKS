Cdda2wav development has been funded by

Project MODE (http://www.mode.net/)

and 

Fraunhofer Institut für integrierte Schaltungen (FhG-IIS)
(http://www.iis.fhg.de/)

Code for extraction of ISRC and MCN codes as well as MD5 signatures
has been made possible by their contributions, thanks very much.


More thanks goto
Zygo Blaxell (a lot of code improvements)
Thomas Niederreiter (extensions for cd-writers)
Piercarlo Grandi (rewrote of cdda2wav's man page)
Stewart Addison (suggestions and a fine web page on cdda)
Leland Olds (the cdda2wav debian maintainer)
Francesco Chemolli (getopt_long patches)

Thanks to all testers and finally Jim McLaughlin for supplying
the first cdda-reader source code (that got me started).
