CDTOOL 1.0 -------------------------------------------------------------

    CDTOOL is a package for Linux that allows the user to control audio 
functions of an attached cd-rom drive from the command line.  With 
minimal modifications, it should work with any operating system that 
uses compatible cd-rom ioctl's (ie, SunOS).

    CDTOOL consists of five programs.  Actually, it is one program that
can be called with five different names:

    cdplay -- play the cd or resume from pause.
    cdpause -- pause play.
    cdstop -- stop play.
    cdeject -- eject the cd, if supported.
    cdir -- list tracks on the cd.

    The cdir command supports a database of artist, title, and track
names in a simple format compatible with Workman, a nice OPEN LOOK based
program for controlling audio discs in a cd-rom drive.  It first looks in 
the user's ~/.cdtooldb file.  Then, if the CDTOOLDBPATH environment
variable is set to a colon-delimited list of files, cdir will check them 
in order until it finds the cd.  This allows users to share a database,
for example.  There is a shell script, "cdadd", which automates adding
entries to the file a bit, but Workman is better for this.

    CDTOOL doesn't do anything fancy.  There is no scan, fast forward,
repeat, etc.  These functions are better performed by a full-screen or
graphical program, and CDTOOL is designed to be a simple, elegant
command line utility.  For more specifics on how to use the program,
read the man page.

    Installation is simple.  If needed, specify your cd-rom device file
in config.h (it defaults to /dev/cdrom).  By default, the binaries go
into /usr/local/bin and the manual pages go into /usr/local/man.  If you
want to change these, edit the Makefile.  Then, just type "make install"
as root.

CHANGES SINCE BETA RELEASE ---------------------------------------------

(1) CDTOOLDBPATH environment variable supported.
(2) Bug in resuming from pause fixed.
(3) Templates printed with -t option now are "filled out" if the
    current disc is listed in a database.
(4) Make file creates links for manual pages during installation.
(5) Code completely reorganized, getopt() used, etc.
(6) Support for SunOS?  If you have gcc, this should compile and run
    fine under SunOS 4.1.*, but I don't have the facilities to test it.
    If you get it working, please let me know.
(7) CDTOOLDEV environment variable overrides default path to device.

Changes (1) - (4) by suggestion of Fred Baumgarten.  Thanks!

STILL TO BE DONE -------------------------------------------------------

(1) Nice interface for editing the database files.
