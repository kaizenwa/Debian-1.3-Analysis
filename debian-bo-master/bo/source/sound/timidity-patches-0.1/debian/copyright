This package was assembled by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org> from sources
at <ftp://archive.cs.umbc.edu/pub/midia/instruments.tar.gz>.

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted of adding various
debian.* files to the distribution, as well as minor changes to the
organization of the files.

From the README on archive.cs.umbc.edu:

 1) GUS instruments were freely obtained from anonymous ftp site:
    archive.epas.utoronto.ca        /pub/pc/ultrasound/gravis/disk
