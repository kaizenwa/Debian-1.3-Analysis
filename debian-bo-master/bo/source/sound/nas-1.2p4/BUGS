Here is a list of the bugs, misfeatures, or significant tasks that we know need
to be taken care of:

    Options for max output gain and the average flows flag need to be
    added to the command line of the sample server.
    
    Some bogus flows can crash or lock up the server.  More error
    checking needs to be done.
    
    There are still several unimplemented protocol requests.
    
    There needs to be a lot more server documentation.
    
    Another rev of the protocol will be needed to add additional
    synchronization primitives.  Ideally, we'd like hooks for 
    synchronizing audio flows with each other (and with X graphics 
    as well).
