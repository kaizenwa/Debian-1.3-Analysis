	  flow terminates while playing multiple flows simultaneously.

	o improved voxware dda driver.
	  (Thanks to Stephen Hocking and Shawn M.)

	o experimental HP dda driver.  (Thanks to William J. Hunter)

	o add a -timeout option to the server to allow the server to
	  terminate after a period of time with no clients.
	  (Thanks to William L. Sebok)
	  To enable this, you must build the NAS tree using the following:

	  make WORLDOPTS='-k CDEBUGFLAGS="$(CDEBUGFLAGS) -DSTARTSERVER"' World

Library
	o fixed a bug in the wave file reader.

	o fixed a bug in the aiff file reader.

	o new soundlib/sound functions AuSoundPlay(), AuSoundRecord(),
	  and SoundTellFile() with man pages.  (Thanks to Yoav Eilat)

          cannot initially connect to a local server.
          (Thanks to William L. Sebok)
	  To enable this, you must build the NAS tree using the following:

	  make WORLDOPTS='-k CDEBUGFLAGS="$(CDEBUGFLAGS) -DSTARTSERVER"' World

Clients
	o add *input resources to all X clients to correct a problem
	  with some window managers not giving focus.

	o fixed bug in auscope when displaying actions or parameters.

	  and the Sun dda drivers. (thanks to Ian Donaldson)

	o fix for multiple bundle elements in a flow. (thanks to Steven King)

	o improved voxware dda driver.
	  (thanks to Christian Schlichtherle and Stephen Hocking)

	o the server now does a range check on the output data and
	  clips correctly.  Due to the possible performance impact,
	  this can be disabled by commenting out the #define
	  OUTPUT_RANGE_CHECK in server/dia/auprocess.c.  ** ATTENTION
	  DDA DEVELOPERS ** this fix required a change to all of the
	  dda drivers.  The output minibufs must be twice as large as
	  they were previously.  (thanks to Steven King)

	o voxware dda driver - Fix problem (apparently from
	  SoundPlayFromBucket) where tail of data was not flushed
	  through card until start of next operation.  (Thanks to Paul
	  F. Werkowski)

	o only call dda set sample rate callback if the rate has changed.

Library
	o SVR3.2 with STREAMSCONN wouldn't work with XDMCP due to a
   	  bug in nameserver.c.  (required XDMCP to be disabled; this
   	  won't affect users of stock NAS 1.2 but would affect those
   	  audio servers that implement XDMCP authorization checking)
	  (thanks to Ian Donaldson)

	o fatal errors now lookup AuErrorDB for more detail.
   	  (like Xlib does with XErrorDB) (thanks to Ian Donaldson)

	o Implementation of user callable error catching functions:
		AuSetErrorHandler()
		AuSetIOErrorHandler()
	  (thanks to Ian Donaldson)

	o added default error handler variables so you can catch errors
	  during the initial server open.  (Thanks to Richard Caley)

	o added some setjmp gunkus to Xtutil.c for use by error handlers.
	  (Thanks to Richard Caley)

	o C++ compatibility. (Thanks to Yoav Eilat)

	o New SoundSeekFile() and SoundFlushFile() functions.

	  to fix possible includes of the wrong NetAudio.tmpl.

	o some notes on building under SunOS 4.1.3 OpenWindows from
	  Ian Donaldson.

	o new API man pages from Steven King.  (Thanks!)

	o made man page installation use standard InstallManPage macro.

	o use AuInstallScript macro to install scripts.

	o fixed some build and install problems under FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.
	  (Thanks to Paul F. Werkowski)

** Release 1.2 **

General
	o A few cosmetic changes.

** PATCH 02 **

Server
	o fixed a bug with monitor elements not returning the correct
	  data.  This caused the meters in audemo to be broken.

	o patches from Steven King

	    - In server/os/connections.c, EstablishNewConnections
              probably ought to check that newconn is less than
              lastfdesc before it is used in the BITSET macro (this in
              the mit X11r5 source, havent looked at r6 yet), tho
              you'd need lots and lots of connections to tickle
              this. Also in connections.c, CheckConnections should
              probably check for EINTR if select returns an error, I
              dont know if any implementation of select would actually
              EINTR for if it got a SIGPOLL or SIGALRM if the timeout
              is zero, but better safe than sorry.

            - FallbackDefineSelf exists and is only referenced in
              os/access.c. Its part of the localconn patch which
              obviously isnt handling non 386 svr4's correctly.

Library
	o fixed a bug in AuSoundRecordToData().  The flow wasn't getting
	  stopped when the recording was finished.

	o fixed compile problem in ConnSvr.c under Dell 2.2 Xfree86-2.1.1.

	o fixed compile problems under some X11R4s that don't define _Xconst.

Clients
	o fixed problem with audial -recognize messing with line mode and
	  gain attributes without checking to see if the device was capable.

	o fixed range/clipping problem in effectsAmplitude in auedit.

General
	o changed occurances of the name "NetAudio" to "Network Audio System"
          or "NAS" due to a name conflict.

	o patches from Ian Donaldson

	    - Solaris 2 server failed to link because of undefined
	      symbol FallbackDefineSelf().

	    - Shared library compilation broke completely due to
	      changes in NetAudio.tmpl and because the include of
	      <Library.tmpl> was moved too high up in
	      lib/audio/Imakefile, and missed out on the
	      DoSharedLib/DoNormalLib flags etc.

** PATCH 01 **

Server
	o fixed a couple of problems with speed changes in the
	  SVR4 VOXware driver.

** Release 1.2b BETA **

	o The file server/PATCHES.sk contains patches from Steven King to
	  improve the handling of audio clipping in the server. I've
	  not applied them to the standard distribution yet because
	  I'm concerned about their possible performance impact.

	o added some documentation about actions.

** PATCH 01 **

Server
	o fixed a bug with looping flows.

Library
	o fixed problem with X11R4 build.

** Release ?.? ALPHA (Feburary 11, 1994) **

Server
	o fixed a bug where the last little bit of audio data would be
	  lost.

	o fixed a bug in readClient where the buffer was being incorrectly
	  padded, possibly resulting in static at the end of the audio data.

	o fixed "strdup" bug in SoundCreate.

	o re-arranged some utility routines into separate modules.
	  (NOTE: possible incompatibility - AuMonitorRate and AuMonitorFormat
	         are no longer externed in audioutil.h)

	o add AuWaveFormToString() and AuStringToWaveForm().

	o add AuSoundRecordToData().

	o add stereo support for voc files (thanks to Steven King).

	o new slider widget for volume/gain controls.

General
	o re-worked the includes of NetAudio.tmpl so it will (hopefully)
	  work on most platforms.

	o builds under SVR3.2 (thanks to Steven King).

** Release 1.1 **

Server
	o Protected malloc/free from audio signals.

	o Fixed setting parameters of waveforms and buckets.

	o New dia/dda interface.

	o Fixed a bug where the flow was re-compiled after
	  an event was requested even if that event didn't change
	  the state of the flow.

	o Fixed possible memory trashing in readClient.

	o Sun driver

		- Don't initialize output gain or internal/external speaker
		  mode.

		- Get rid of some 'clicks'.

********************************************************************************
			      CHANGES.labtam
********************************************************************************

Many thanks to Ian M. Donaldson at Labtam for the following:

- Now compiles cleanly on all these without any compiler warnings
  whatsoever (well the odd one or two under X11R4).

	- Solaris 2.3 on SS1000 under Sun provided Open Windows 3.2
	  Server untested.  
	      (We only have a SS1000 running 2.3 which has no audio device)

	  Porting required because Sun changed the audio interface
	  slightly in Solaris 2 versus SunOS 4.

	  Clients tested reasonably.

	- AIX 3.2 on a RS6000/220 under IBM provided X11R4
	  No server port done.  Don't have access to any IBM audio hardware.
	  Clients tested reasonably.

	- SunOS 4.1.2  on a Sun IPX under MIT provided X11R5.
	  (no porting required specific to this platform)
	  Both clients and server tested reasonably.

	- SVR4.0/486  on one of our own computers under MIT provided X11R5.
	  (as a guess comparable to Dell SVR4.0 or ESIX SVR4.0)
	  We used native STREAMSCONN TLI TCP/IP transport.
	  No server port done.  This computer never had audio hardware.
	  Clients tested reasonably.

	- SVR3.2/486  on one of our own computers under MIT provided X11R4.
	  This O/S uses Lachman provided TCP/IP, and we used
	  STREAMSCONN TLI TCP/IP transport.
	  No server port done.  This computer never had audio hardware.
	  Clients tested reasonably.

	  Unfortuantely every SVR3.2 system has some different
	  quirk since TCP was non-standard then.   No guarantees
	  it will compile better on other types.

- Bugfixes
	- server had byte swapping  error that crashed playbucket(1)
	  when client run from opposite endian host

	- autool crashed on little endian host when volume slider was
	  used when stopped (hung on big endian host)

	- various signal mis-use.  Background processes from non-job
	  control shells don't die when ^C hit anymore.

	- "SVR4" is not a reliable symbol for use in Imakefiles; use SystemV4
	  instead.  (broke audial).

	- in Netaudio.tmpl, don't redefine MKDIRHIER or BINDIR by
	  default as this breaks the bootstrap in subtle ways on 
	  certain systems.  Audio clients now get installed in the
	  same directory that X clients do rather than /usr/local/bin.

	  On Solaris 2.3 with OpenWindows, this means /usr/openwin/bin,
	  otherwise it usually means /usr/bin/X11.
	  Similarly for header files, app-defaults and libraries.

	- build will not fail on systems that don't have servers ported
	  to them.  This allows the clients and libraries to be built
	  on all platforms and servers on a subset.

- libaudio is built as a shared library (currently rev 2.0) on systems
  where libX11 is built shared.  In the list above that means
  Solaris 2.3, SunOS 4.1, SVR4.0.
  I used rev 1.0 for the September 93 netaudio release but changes
  between then and netaudio 1.1 looked somewhat incompatable so I bumped
  the revision number then.

- X11R4 compatability re-added in so compiliation in those 
  environments is now possible.

- STREAMSCONN support for SVR3.2 and SVR4.0 for libaudio.  
  This is a direct port from MIT X11R5 with the odd fix-tracker applied.
  NB: Not done for auscope(1).  sockets used in that case.
  (this is ok but if people want binary compatability from SVR3.2
  to SVR4 sockets won't work because SVR3.2 has no standard socket ABI)

- Better System-V and SVR4 support

	- Use System-V reliable signals.  (ie: sigset(2)).  
	  signal(2) is unreliable on System-V systems.
	  Didn't bother with SVR4/POSIX signals; SVR3 signals work
	  fine on SVR4 and are easier to understand and code.

	- don't use libucb at all on SVR4.  This library is bad news
	  on most SVR4 systems and should be avoided like the plague!

- Better ANSI support (SVR4 + Solaris)

	- use ANSI memcpy/memset exclusively on ANSI systems instead
	  of bcopy/bzero

	- eliminated all SVR4.0/486 cc's reported warnings of callback
	  function type declaration mismatches.  (this is the bulk
	  of the changes).  Solaris 2 cc doesn't report half these things
	  unfortunately.

- auscope(1) now has a '-n' flag so it can be run in background reliably.

- 'make install' now fully installs correctly.  Even app-defaults!

- 'make clean' now properly cleans

********************************************************************************

Thanks to Steven King for the following:

- building on ISC

    I had a few problems building 1.2a on my system running ISC SVR3.2r4.0
    with the imake enviroment provided by XFree86 (It looks to be more
    work than its worth to get netaudio to build with the vendor supplied
    X11R4).

    In server/dia/au.h, ISC doesnt have memmove, however bcopy and friends
    are in the normal library search path.

    In lib/audio/Alibnet.h, the omission of the #define for _AuWriteV
    resulted in link errors for all clients.

    In lib/audio/Imakefile, the SYSV_DEFINES macro causes major grief if
    one has installed XFree, I would expect this to be true for any SVR32
    that has XFree.  Also, I found it usefull to include NetAudio.tmpl
    after Library.tmp so that I could redefine things like CDEBUGFLAGS and
    such in NetAudio.tmpl

    In clients/audio/audemo/audemo.c, ISC needed sys/time.h included, I
    suspect most SYSV's will as well.

    In clients/audio/audial/audial.c, the compile breaks on the inclusion
    of sys/file.h, I think this is a ISC 4.0 specific problem.

- localconn patches

    These patches are derived from the XFree86 2.0 release.  I pretty much
    just merged the XFree patches into netaudio.  My principle interest
    was in the streams localconn code for ISC; besides greatly improving
    the performance for local clients, they allow the server to run with
    the system at run level 2, or on systems where full networking isnt
    availible (an extra $$$ option on ISC and lots of other PC sysVs).
     In addition to the ISC code, theres also support for other systems, SVR4,
    SCO, linux and net/free bsd, which may or may not be usefull depending
    on the system (ie, is anyone doing an independent SCO port?).  There
    is also alot of code for a minix and amoeba port.  I can pretty much
    guarantee that this will not work, but I left it in as it doesnt affect
    the other systems and might give a leg up to anyone attempting a minix
    or amoeba port.

- NetAudio.tmpl

    Make clients get rebuilt after libaudio.a changes.
