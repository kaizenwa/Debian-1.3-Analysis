DESCRIPTION: The Network Audio System (NAS).
 The Network Audio System was developed by NCD for playing, recording, and
 manipulating audio data over a network.  Like the X Window System, it uses
 the client/server model to separate applications from the specific drivers
 that control audio input and output devices.
