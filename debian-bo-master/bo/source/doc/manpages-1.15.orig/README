This package contains the Linux man pages for all chapters
except 1 and 8. Some more information is given in the
`Announce' file.

Install by copying to your favourite location.
"make install" will copy them to /usr/man/man[1-8].

If your man pager can handle compressed source pages
(man-1.4 can), you might do "make gz" before "make install".

Note that sometimes these pages are duplicates of pages
also distributed in other packages. This has been reported
about modules.2, exports.5 and mailaddr.7. Be careful not
to overwrite more up-to-date versions.
(Probably I'll remove these pages one of these days.
Reports on further duplicates are welcome.)

Copyrights: These man pages come under various copyrights.
All are freely distributable when the nroff source is included.
