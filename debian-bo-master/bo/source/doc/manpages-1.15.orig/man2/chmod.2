.TH CHMOD 2 "January 12, 1997" "" "System calls"
.SH NAME
chmod, fchmod \- change permissions of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/stat.h>
.sp
.BI "int chmod(const char *" path ", mode_t " mode );
.br
.BI "int fchmod(int " fildes ", mode_t " mode );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The mode of the file given by
.I path
or referenced by
.I filedes
is changed.

Modes are specified by
.IR or'ing
the following:
.RS
.sp
.TP 1.0i
S_ISUID
04000 set user ID on execution
.TP
S_ISGID
02000 set group ID on execution
.TP
S_ISVTX
01000 sticky bit
.TP
S_IRUSR (S_IREAD)
00400 read by owner
.TP
S_IWUSR (S_IWRITE)
00200 write by owner
.TP
S_IXUSR (S_IEXEC)
00100 execute/search by owner
.TP
S_IRGRP
00040 read by group
.TP
S_IWGRP
00020 write by group
.TP
S_IXGRP
00010 execute/search by group
.TP
S_IROTH
00004 read by others
.TP
S_IWOTH
00002 write by others
.TP
S_IXOTH
00001 execute/search by others
.sp
.RE

The effective UID of the process must be zero or must match the owner of
the file.

The effective UID or GID must be appropriate for setting execution bits.

Depending on the file system, set user ID and set group ID execution bits
may be turned off if a file is written.  On some file systems, only the
super-user can set the sticky bit, which may have a special meaning (i.e.,
for directories, a file can only be deleted by the owner or the super-user).

On NFS file systems, restricting the permissions will immediately influence
already open files, because the access control is done on the server, but
open files are maintained by the client.  Widening the permissions may be
delayed for other clients if attribute caching is enabled on them.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
Depending on the file system, other errors can be returned.  The more
general errors for
.B chmod
are listed below:

.TP 0.8i
.B EPERM
The effective UID does not match the owner of the file, and is not zero.
.TP
.B EROFS
The named file resides on a read-only file system.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I path
points outside your accessible address space.
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.I path
is too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The file does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
.TP
.B ELOOP
.I path
contains a circular reference (i.e., via a symbolic link)
.PP
The general errors for
.B fchmod
are listed below:
.TP 0.8i
.B EBADF
The descriptor is not valid.
.TP
.B ENOENT
See above.
.B EIO
A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The
.B chmod
call conforms to SVr4, SVID, POSIX, X/OPEN, 4.4BSD.
SVr4 documents EINTR, ENOLINK and EMULTIHOP returns, but no
ENOMEM.  POSIX.1 does not document ENOMEM or ELOOP error
conditions.
.PP
The 
.B fchmod
call conforms to 4.4BSD and SVr4.
SVr4 documents additional EIO, EINTR, and ENOLINK error conditions.
.PP
POSIX and X/OPEN do not document the sticky bit.
.TP
.B EPERM
See above.
.TP
.B EROFS
See above.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
\fBchmod\fP conforms to POSIX, but \fBS_ISVTX\fP (the sticky bit) does not,
neither do the macros \fBS_IREAD\fP, \fBS_IWRITE\fP and \fBS_IEXEC\fP.
POSIX specifies that some implementations may ignore \fBS_ISUID\fP and
\fBS_ISGID\fP.  Further according to POSIX, you should not attempt to
set any bits which are not listed above.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR open "(2), " chown "(2), " stat "(2) "
