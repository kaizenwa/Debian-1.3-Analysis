.TH LSEEK 2 "10 June 1995" "Linux 1.2.9" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
lseek \- reposition read/write file offset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "off_t lseek(int " fildes ", off_t " offset ", int " whence );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B lseek
function repositions the offset of the file descriptor
.I fildes
to the argument
.I offset
according to the directive
.IR  whence .
The argument
.I fildes
must be an open file descriptor.
.B Lseek
repositions the file pointer
.I fildes
as follows:
.RS
.sp
If
.I whence
is
.BR SEEK_SET ,
the offset is set to
.I offset
bytes.

If
.I whence
is
.BR SEEK_CUR ,
the offset is set to its current location plus
.I offset
bytes.

If
.I whence
is
.BR SEEK_END ,
the offset is set to the size of the file plus
.I offset
bytes.
.RE

The
.B lseek
function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of the existing
end-of-file of the file. If data is later written at this point, subsequent
reads of the data in the gap return bytes of zeros (until data is actually
written into the gap).

Some devices are incapable of seeking.  The value of the pointer
associated with such a device is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion,
.B lseek
returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from the
beginning of the file.  Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I Fildes
is not an open file descriptor.
.TP
.B ESPIPE
.I Fildes
is associated with a pipe, socket, or FIFO.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I Whence
is not a proper value.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, POSIX, BSD 4.3
.SH BUGS
This document's use of
.I whence
is incorrect English, but maintained for historical reasons.
