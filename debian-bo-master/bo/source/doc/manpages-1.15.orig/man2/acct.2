.TH ACCT 2 "10 August 1993" "Linux 0.99.11" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
acct \- switch process accounting on or off
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ad l
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int acct(const char *" filename );
.fi
.ad b
.SH DESCRIPTION
When called with the name of an existing file as argument, accounting is
turned on, records for each terminating process are appended to
\fIfilename\fP as it terminates.  An argument of \fBNULL\fP causes
accounting to be turned off.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 0.8i
.B ENOSYS
The accounting kit has not been installed.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4 (but not POSIX).  SVr4 documents EACCES, EBUSY, EFAULT,
ELOOP, ENAMETOOLONG, ENOTDIR, ENOENT, EPERM and EROFS error
conditions, but no ENOSYS.
.SH NOTES
No accounting is produced for programs running when a crash occurs.  In
particular, nonterminating processes are never accounted for.
