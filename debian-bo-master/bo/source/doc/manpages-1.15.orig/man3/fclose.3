.SH NAME
fclose \- close a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "int fclose( FILE *" stream );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B fclose
function dissociates the named
.I stream
from its underlying file or set of functions.  If the stream was being used
for output, any buffered data is written first, using
.BR fflush (3).
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
.B EOF
is returned and the global variable
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.  In either case no further access to the
stream is possible.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
The argument
.I stream
is not an open stream.
.PP
The
.B fclose
function may also fail and set
.I errno
for any of the errors specified for the routines
.BR close (2)
or
.BR fflush (3).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR close "(2), " fflush "(3), " fopen "(3), " setbuf (3)
.SH STANDARDS
The
.B fclose
function conforms to ANSI C3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').
