.TH SETLOCALE 3  "April 18, 1993" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
setlocale \- set the current locale.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <locale.h>
.sp
.BI "char *setlocale(int " category ", const char * " locale ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B setlocale()
function is used to set or query the program's current locale.
If 
.I locale
is
.BR """C""" " or " """POSIX""" ,
the current locale is set to the portable locale.
.PP
If 
.I locale
is
.BR """""" ,
the locale is set to the default locale which is selected from the
environment variable
.BR LANG .
.PP
On startup of the main program, the portable
.B """C"""
locale is selected as default.
.PP
The argument
.I category
determines which functions are influenced by the new locale:
.TP
.B LC_ALL
for all of the locale.
.TP
.B LC_COLLATE
for the functions
.BR strcoll() " and " strxfrm() .
.TP
.B LC_CTYPE
for the character classification and conversion routines.
.TP
.B LC_MONETARY
for
.BR localeconv() .
.TP
.B LC_NUMERIC
for the decimal character.
.TP
.B LC_TIME
for 
.BR strftime() .
.B NULL
if the request cannot not be honored.
This string may be allocated in static storage.
.PP
A program may be made portable to all locales by calling
.B setlocale(LC_ALL, """""")
after program  initialization, by using the values returned
from a
.B localeconv()
call
for locale \- dependent information and by using
.B strcoll()
or 
.B strxfrm()
to compare strings.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ANSI C, POSIX.1
.PP
Linux supports the portable locales
.BR """C""" " and " """POSIX"""
and also the European Latin-1 
.B """ISO-8859-1"""
, and Russian
.B """KOI-8"""
locales.
.PP
The
.B printf()
family of functions may or may not honor the current locale.
