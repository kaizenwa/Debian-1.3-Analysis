The \fBbcmp()\fP function compares the first \fIn\fP bytes of the
strings \fIs1\fP and \fIs2\fP.  If the two strings are equal, 
\fBbcmp()\fP returns 0, otherwise it returns a non-zero result.  
If \fIn\fP is zero, the two strings are assumed to be equal.

The \fBbcmp()\fP function returns 0 if the strings are equal,
otherwise a non-zero result is returned.
