.SH NAME
alloca \- memory allocator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.BI "void *alloca( size_t " size );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B alloca
function allocates
.I size
bytes of space in the stack frame of the caller.  This temporary space is
automatically freed on return.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
The
.B alloca
function returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated space.  If the
allocation failed, a
.B NULL
pointer is returned.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
There is evidence that the
.B alloca
function appeared in 32v, pwb, pwb.2, 3bsd, and 4bsd.  There is a man page
for it in BSD 4.3.  Linux uses the GNU version.
.SH BUGS
The
.B alloca
function is machine dependent.
