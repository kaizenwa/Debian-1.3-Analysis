.TH ASSERT 3  "April 4, 1993" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
assert \- Abort the program if assertion is false.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <assert.h>
.sp
.BI "void assert (int " "expression" ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B assert()
prints an error message to standard output and terminates the program
by calling
.B abort()
if
.B expression
is false (i.e., compares equal to zero).  This only happens when the macro
.B NDEBUG
is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
No value is returned.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ISO9899 (ANSI C)
.SH "BUGS"
.B assert()
is implemented as a macro; if the expression tested has side - effects,
program behaviour will be different depending on whether
.B NDEBUG
is defined. This may create Heisenbugs which go away when debugging is turned on.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR exit "(3), " abort (3)
