.SH NAME
ecvt, fcvt \- convert a floating-point number to a string.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.BI "char *ecvt(double " number ", size_t " ndigits ", int *" decpt ,
.BI "int *" sign );
.sp
.BI "char *fcvt(double " number ", size_t " ndigits ", int *" decpt ,
.BI "int *" sign );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBecvt()\fP function converts \fInumber\fP to a NULL terminated
string of \fIndigits\fP digits, and returns a pointer to the string.
The string itself does not contain a decimal point; however, the position
of the decimal point relative to the start of the string is stored in
\fIdecpt\fP.  A negative value for \fIdecpt\fP means that the decimal
point is to the left of the start of the string.  If the sign of
\fInumber\fP is negative, \fIsign\fP is set to a non-zero value, otherwise
it's set to 0.
.PP
The \fBfcvt()\fP function is identical to \fBecvt()\fP, except that
\fIndigits\fP specifies the number of digits after the decimal point.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Both the \fBecvt()\fP and \fBfcvt()\fP functions return a pointer to a 
static string containing the ASCII representation of \fInumber\fP.
The static string is overwritten by each call to \fBecvt()\fP or
\fBfcvt()\fP.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR gcvt "(3), " sprintf (3)
