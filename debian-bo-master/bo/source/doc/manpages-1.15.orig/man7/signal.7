Signal	Value	Action	Comment
SIGTRAP	5	CG	Trace/breakpoint trap
SIGIOT	6	CG	IOT trap. A synonym for SIGABRT
SIGEMT	7,\-,7	G
SIGBUS	10,7,10	AG	Bus error
SIGSYS	12,\-,12	G	Bad argument to routine (SVID)
SIGSTKFLT	\-,16,\-	AG	Stack fault on coprocessor

SIGLOST	\-,\-,\-	AG	File lock lost
SIGWINCH	28,28,20	BG	Window resize signal (4.3 BSD, Sun)
SIGUNUSED	\-,31,\-	AG	Unused signal
.TE
(Here \- denotes that a signal is absent; there where three values
are given, the first one is usually valid for alpha and sparc,
the middle one for i386 and ppc, the last one for mips. Signal 29
is SIGINFO / SIGPWR on an alpha but SIGLOST on a sparc.)
.PP
The letters in the "Action" column have the following meanings:
.IP A
Default action is to terminate the process.
.IP B
Default action is to ignore the signal.
.IP C
Default action is to dump core.
.IP D
Default action is to stop the process.
.IP E
Signal cannot be caught.
.IP F
Signal cannot be ignored.
.IP G
Not a POSIX.1 conformant signal.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX.1
.SH BUGS
SIGIO and SIGLOST have the same value.
The latter is commented out in the kernel source, but
the build process of some software still thinks that
signal 29 is SIGLOST.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR kill (1),
.BR kill (2),
.BR setitimer (2).
