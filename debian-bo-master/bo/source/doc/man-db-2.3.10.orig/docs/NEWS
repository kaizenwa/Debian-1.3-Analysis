Major changes since man_db-2.3.5:

	Fixes:
	------

	o Global databases were not owned by setuid owner (if applicable).
	  As a consequence only mandb could update the databases unless
	  man was run by superuser.  Stupid bug.  

	o The keyword passed to apropos _never_ matched the first word
	  of any whatis line.

	o FAVOUR_STRAYCATS code (if enabled), did not work properly.

	o zsoelim did not work as advertised.

	Improvements:
	-------------

	o Man removes it's temporary files upon abnormal termination.

	o apropos does proper word matching rather than the fuzzy
	  matching of 2.3.5.  eg. supplying any of the keywords:
	  `ld.so', `a.out', `dynamic', `linker' or `loader' will match 
	  the following entry:

	  ld.so (8)            - a.out dynamic linker/loader
	
	  whereas `a.out' and `loader' used to fail.

	o man/whatis/apropos return with exit code 16 if manual
	  page/file or keyword is not matched.  Previously exit code 0
	  was used making it difficult for callers to know if the lookup 
	  was successful.

	o addition of German message catalogue.

	o `apropos' and `man -k' do POSIX specified regex matching rather 
	  than keyword searches if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT 
	  is defined.

	o added glob-only support of native system manual hierarchies
	  on HP-UX, OSF and Solaris operating systems.  Improved the
	  whatis parsing code to cope with majority of HP-UX manual pages.

	o ported to NeXTstep.

Major changes since man_db-2.2.1:

	Added support for...
	--------------------
	
	o Non-standard section names i.e. multi-character

	o Compressed manual pages. 
	  A new utility `zsoelim' is included to correctly handle nroff
	  .so requests that point to a file which has been compressed.

	o Compressed stray cats.
	  By definition, stray cats are not re-creatable as they have no
	  relative source manual page. As they may have non-default
	  compression extensions and may reside on read-only media, 
	  stray cats have the same compression support as manual pages.

	o FSSTND proposed `extension' support.
	  Specific package manual pages may be installed in the standard 
	  sections but with a package-unique extension appended as in
	  exit(3tcl) - ../man/man3/exit.3tcl.  Using the command 

		`man -e tcl exit' 

	  would then display an exit manual page with a tcl extension, if
	  available.  Of course, `man 3tcl exit' works as always.

	o FSSTND proposed NLS man subdirectories.
	  Of the form .../man/<locale>/man<sec>/

	o NLS message catalogue hooks.
	  Provision has been made for the programs to emit their messages in
	  a language dependent form.

	o `whatis' referred manual pages.
	  Some manual pages contain relevant information for commands or 
	  programs that would not otherwise reference the page.
	  The `whatis' part of the manual page is used to create virtual
	  links to these pages by all of the names mentioned within it.
	  Examples include names such as `.' and `:' referencing the local
	  shell manual page.

	o Catman utility.
	  Used to pre-format the manual pages into cat pages.

	o Operating systems other than Linux.
	  man_db has been reported to compile on the following platforms:
	  
		Linux, SunOS, Solaris, Ultrix, OSF, HP-UX, AIX, IRIX

          (although portability does not extend to support of native 
	   manual tree structures on some of these systems, eg. HP-UX)

	o Berkeley DB library routines.
	  This compliments the support of both gdbm and ndbm which already
	  existed.  DB databases may be shared across platforms.

	o $MANOPTS environment variable.
	  The environment variable MANOPTS may be set to any string in
	  command line option/argument format.  It is parsed by man(1) prior
	  to it's actual command line.

	o Per manual hierarchy cat directory locations.
	  It is possible to redirect your cat pages to other directories or
	  even other file systems. 
	  
	o Per manual hierarchy nroff/[tg]roff format scripts.
	  Ability to create custom formatter scripts that are called by
	  man(1) to enable format/display of non-standard manual pages or 
	  manual pages requiring a special macro package.

	o Extension of `man -l'.
	  Arguments following -l are interpreted as local files requiring
	  format and display.  Extensions are: 

		`man -l -' formats and displays stdin.
		`man -l foo.1.gz' decompresses, formats and displays foo.1.gz.
	
	o Latin1 manual pages/choice of nroff output device.

	o Viewing of ASCII manual pages formatted for a latin1 output device
	  on a 7 bit ASCII terminal (-7).
	  
	o Whatis and apropos utilities support regex and wildcard matching.

	o checkman. 
	  Shell script utility that will find and display duplicated manual
	  pages found across manual page hierarchies.

	o mkcatdirs. 
	  Shell script utility to create appropriate cat directories after
	  installation and setup.

	Conceptual improvements
	-----------------------

	o Replacement of single database with multiple modular db's.
	  Easier integration of additional information into the databases in
	  the future. 

	o Both user and global databases share the same name: 
	  	
		`index.<db-type>' 
	
	  where <db-type> could be `bt', `db' or `pag' and `dir'.

	o Databases contain `whatis' text.
	  Makewhatis and text whatis databases are redundant, although
	  whatis and apropos will use the text whatis database for information 
	  if they cannot read from a relevant index database.

	o straycats handled without need for `placeholders'.

	o Friendly less(1) prompt.
	  If man(1) uses less(1) as it's pager (dependent on both static and
	  dynamic factors), the prompt is modified to suit the manual page 
	  being displayed.  The modification performed is also changeable by
	  the user.

	o man_db manual.
	  man_db has a manual that covers the setup, maintenance and use of
	  a generic online manual page system.

	o Modes of operation.
	  The man_db utilities can be compiled with various modes of
	  operation in mind.  Eg. man can be stopped from updating databases 
	  and/or creating cat files in situations where security is extremely 
	  important.  See the man_db manual for details.

	Speed improvements
	------------------

	o Background compression/saving of cat files.
	  Cat files are compressed and saved in the background, whilst the
	  user is able to browse the formatted page directly.

	o Merge of straycats and makewhatis into mandb.
	  While mandb has slowed, it now incorporates makewhatis and straycats 
	  functionality and is much faster as a whole.  2.0a2 used grep/awk, 
	  2.2 used C regex and 2.3 now uses lex sourced C to strip out the 
	  whatis information from the raw man or cat files.

	o Berkeley DB support.
	  Provides lower database initialisation overhead as compared with 
	  gdbm.

	o Extremely fast whatis(1) searches.
	  whatis(1) uses keyed database lookups to retrieve whatis strings
	  for standard (non regex/wildcard) searches.
	
	Fixes
	-----
	
	o Correct handling of $MANSECT.
	  The environment variable MANSECT is no longer ignored.

	o Acknowledgement of $MANPATH order.
	  manpath elements are searched in the order specified.
