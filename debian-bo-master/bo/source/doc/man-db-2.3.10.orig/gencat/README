These are the sources to the enhanced gencat software.  The enhanced
gencat can, in addition to performing the same functions as the
standard gencat, also compile header files and generate a list of defines
from a message file.  This is useful because it allows programmers
to use descriptive names when referring to messages instead of having
to use integers all the time.

I have also included the xtract utility in this package.  This can be used
to extract text messages from source code, preformat these messages
and then place them into a message file.  Its operation is as follows:

        xtract < source_code.c > message_file.m

To compile both packages, simply type:
	make all
If both packages have successfully compiled, then typing:
	make install
will install the binaries, and typing:
	make install.man
will install the man pages.

Note: both gencat and xtract have been testing under Linux and SunOS 4.1.3.
They should be fairly portable.  If you have difficulties compiling the
package on your system or have found any bugs, do not hesitate to contact
me.

Note2: Some systems are unable to generate a proper C source file from the
xtract lex source code.  SunOS 4.1.3 is one of these.  I have included
a copy of the C source code that was generated under Linux and which can be
compiled under SunOS to generate a proper xtract binary.  However, you will
need to modify the Makefile to prevent it from trying to generate a new
C source code file from the xtract.l lex sources and trying to compile this
newly generated C source code.  I have stored the original Linux generated C
source code file under the name:
	xtract.c.bak
just in case your system's lex cannot generate the correct C source code
from the lex source.
