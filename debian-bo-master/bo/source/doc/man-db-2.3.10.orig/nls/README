Ok, folks. The directory en_GB contains British English messages, which will
be made into a cat when make is run. These are copies of the default messages 
that the man package utilities will emit.

(They are created by using xcat < src_file > message_file. xcat is found in
the ../xcat directory)

To create a _useful_ native language catalogue:

	mkdir <your_chosen_locale>
	cd en_GB
	tar cvf - * | (cd ../<your_chosen_locale> && tar xvf -)
	cd <your_chosen_locale>

Then translate all of the messages lines, beginning "# " (some of which 
continue onto several lines) into your native language.

Then 
	make install nls=<your_chosen_locale>

will create your new catalogue and copy it to 
${prefix}/lib/locale/<your_chosen_locale>/man_db.cat

To try it out, export LC_MESSAGES=<your_chosen_locale> and run one of the
-DNLS compiled utilities.

I know these are very brief instructions, but I guess you lot don't need me
to tell you everything :) Also, please let me know before you start doing a
complete translation, so that I can keep a record of activity.
