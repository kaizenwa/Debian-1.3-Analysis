    This edition, 1.04 of 2 October 1995 only corrects typographical
    errors in the previous editions, 1.01, 1.02, and 1.03.  
    There are no other changes.

    This is an elementary introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp
    for people who are not programmers, and who are not necessarily
    interested in programming, but who do want to customize or extend
    their computing environment.

The tar file, `intro-emacs-lisp-1.04.tar', contains the Texinfo
source file for `emacs-lisp-intro.texi'.  You may convert this Texinfo
file to Info to read online or typeset it to print.

This tar file contains:

    emacs-lisp-intro.texi      

                    approx 670 kilobytes   Edition 1.04    2 Oct 1995
                    with settings for default 8.5 by 11 inch printing,
                    and no included PostScript figures (uses ASCII
                    figures instead)


In smallbook format, which I prefer even when printing on 8.5 by 11
inch paper, this manual prints to 276 pages; however I have set this
to print in the standard 8.5 by 11 inch size.  You may want to change
this.

This Texinfo source file, `emacs-lisp-intro.texi', formats without
error using TeX version 3.1415 and `texinfo.tex' version 2.145, and
`makeinfo' version 1.55.  Unless you change it, the source file does
not format with the obsolete `texinfo.tex' version 2.108.

Also, this tar file contains the following optional Encapsulated Post
Script figures.

    chest-of-drawers-diagram.eps    11876 bytes
    cons-cell-diagram1.eps          12136 
    cons-cell-diagram2.eps          12523 
    cons-cell-diagram2a.eps         12420 
    cons-cell-diagram3.eps          12984 
    cons-cell-diagram4.eps          13867 
    cons-cell-diagram5.eps          12986 
    lambda-diagram1.eps             10252 
    lambda-diagram2.eps             10278 
    lambda-diagram3.eps             10275 

See the beginning of the `emacs-lisp-intro.texi' file for appropriate
settings.  These figures are not necessary; they are merely nice to
look at --- without them you get the same figures printed with ASCII
characters.

Whether and how you print PostScript depends on your site.  You not
only need to set 'print-postscript-figures' before creating the .dvi
file, but then must convert the .dvi file to .ps with a 'dvips' or
equivalent command.  You may also have to edit the paths for the
included .eps files in 'emacs-lisp-intro.texi' to change the location
from '/usr/local/lib/emacs/man/' to where ever you have put the files.

On some systems you will see an error message when `psfig.tex' is
loaded for the last two .eps files:

            ! No room for a new \write .

If this happens, try `epsf.tex' instead of `psfig.tex', or try typing
RET at the error; the formatting may continue successfully.

Here are the instructions on formatting that you will find in the
beginning of the Texinfo file 'emacs-lisp-intro.texi'.  Best Wishes!

@c ================ Included Figures ================

@c Set  print-postscript-figures  if you print PostScript figures.
@c If you clear this, the ten figures will be printed as ASCII diagrams.
@c (This is not relevant to Info, since Info only handles ASCII.) 
@c Your site may require editing changes to print PostScript; in this
@c case, search for `print-postscript-figures' and make appropriate changes.

@c ================ Size to Print Book ================

@c This manual can be printed in any of three different sizes.
@c In the above header, set @-commands appropriately.

@c     7 by 9.25 inches:          
@c              @smallbook
@c              @clear largebook

@c     8.5 by 11 inches:
@c              @set largebook

@c     European A4 size paper:   
@c              @afourpaper
@c              @set largebook

@c ================ How to Create an Info file ================

@c If you have `makeinfo' installed, run the following command  
@c (where  %  is the shell prompt): 

@c     % makeinfo emacs-lisp-intro.texi

@c or else, inside of GNU Emacs, find the `emacs-lisp-intro.texi' 
@c and then run: 

@c     M-x texinfo-format-buffer

@c After creating the Info file, edit your Info `dir' file
@c appropriately.  (The `dir' file is often in the `/usr/local/info/'
@c directory.)

@c ================ How to Create an HTML file ================

@c To convert to HTML format, apply `texi2html' or 
@c similar command to the `emacs-lisp-intro.texi' file.

@c ================ How to Typeset and Print ================

@c Note: unless you change it, this file does not format with the
@c obsolete `texinfo.tex 2.108'; use a more recent version.  This file
@c formats without error using `TeX 3.1415' and `texinfo.tex 2.145'.

@c If you do not include PostScript figures, run either of the
@c following command sequences, or similar commands suited to your
@c system: 

@c     % texi2dvi emacs-lisp-intro.texi
@c     % lpr -d emacs-lisp-intro.dvi

@c or else:

@c     % tex emacs-lisp-intro.texi
@c     % texindex emacs-lisp-intro.??
@c     % tex emacs-lisp-intro.texi
@c     % lpr -d emacs-lisp-intro.dvi

@c If you include the PostScript figures, you must convert the .dvi
@c file to a .ps file before printing.  Run either of the
@c following command sequences, or one similar:
@c
@c     % dvips -f < emacs-lisp-intro.dvi > emacs-lisp-intro.ps
@c
@c or else:
@c 
@c     % postscript -p < emacs-lisp-intro.dvi > emacs-lisp-intro.ps
@c

@c (Note: if you edit the book so as to change the length of the
@c table of contents, you may have to change the value of `pageno' below.)

@c ================ End of Formatting Sections ================
