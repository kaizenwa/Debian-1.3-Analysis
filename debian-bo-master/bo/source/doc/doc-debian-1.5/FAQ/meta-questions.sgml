<sect1><heading>In what format is this document written?
       <label id="DocumentFormats"></>
<P>
 This document was written using the Linuxdoc-SGML DTD.
 The Linuxdoc-SGML system (now called SGML-Tools) 
can be used to create files in a variety of
other formats, e.g., GNU info, HTML, LaTeX, TeX .dvi format, 
and PostScript (TM) files. sdc (SGML Document Compiler) 
is an alternative system that in some cases produces better output than 
SGML-Tools. SGML-Tools and sdc are available as Debian packages.
