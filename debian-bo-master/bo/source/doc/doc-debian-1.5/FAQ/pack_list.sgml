<sect>Software available in the Debian system <label id="Software">
<P> 
<sect1>What types of applications and development software are available for Debian GNU/Linux?
<P>
Like most Linux distributions, Debian GNU/Linux provides:
<itemize>
<item>the major GNU applications for software development, 
file manipulation, and text processing, including gcc, libc, 
g++, make, texinfo, gnuplot, the Bash shell and numerous upgraded 
Unix utilities,
<item>Perl and its libraries,
<item>TeX, LaTeX, and dvips,
<item>the X Window System, which provides a networked graphical user 
interface for Linux, and numerous X applications,
<item>a full suite of other networking applications, including WWW servers,
browsers, and development tools.
</itemize>
<!-- XXX keep numbers up-to-date -->
Nearly 700 packages, ranging from news servers and readers to sound support,
FAX programs, database and spreadsheet programs, image processing programs,
communications, net, and mail utilities, Web servers, and 
even ham-radio programs are included in the distribution.
Another 50 software suites are available as Debian packages, but are not
formally part of Debian due to license restrictions.

<sect1>Who wrote all that software?
<P>
<itemize>
<item>For each package the <em>authors</em> of this program are
credited in the file <tt>/usr/doc/PACKAGE/copyright</tt>, where
PACKAGE is to be substituted with the package's name. (Packages
conforming to an older Debian Packaging Standard have this in the file
<tt>/usr/doc/copyright/PACKAGE</tt> instead.)
<item><em>Maintainers</em> who package this software for the Debian Linux system
are listed in the <ref id="CtlFile" name="Debian control file"> that comes 
with each package.
</itemize>

<sect1>How can I get a current list of programs that have been packaged for the Debian project?
<P>
A complete list is available from any of the 
Debian <htmlurl url="http://www.debian.org/ftplist.html" name="mirrors">.

<P>
 The file <tt>indices/Packages-Master-i386.gz</tt> provides a list,
  including short descriptions, of all packages that are available for
  computers with 80386 (or more advanced) chips.
 The file <tt>indices/Packages-Master-m68k.gz</tt> provides a similar list
  of packages that are available for computers with Motorola 68k0x0 CPUs.

<P>
The <htmlurl url="http://www.debian.org/FTP/" name="WWW interface to the Debian
packages"> conveniently summarizes the packages in each of about twenty
&dquot;sections&dquot; of the Debian archive, as well as the 10 most
recently uploaded packages.

<sect1>What is missing from Debian GNU/Linux?
<P>
A list of packages which are most urgently needed for Debian
is maintained by Sven Rudolph.  For more details, see the section
<ref id="contrib" name="on contributing to the Debian project">.

<sect1>(How) Does Debian support Java?
<P>
The Java Development Kit from Sun is currently available as a Debian
package (<tt>jdk_VVV-RRR.deb</tt>).  The JDK will allow you to run 
Java programs and applets, and write your own.  If your kernel is 
properly configured (see below), the JDK will allow you to 
<em>run</em> Java programs just like other 
executables.  The JDK package also includes a number of demo programs.
<P>
<!-- XXX general "how to load a module" section ? -->
Debian's kernel is configured with Java support built in as a module (i.e.,
CONFIG_BINFMT_JAVA=m).  Users who wish to build their own 
<ref id="custker" name="custom kernel"> can of course omit this if 
they choose.  Once module support is available in the kernel, you
need to make sure the module is loaded.  You can do it at boot time
by inserting the line <tt>binfmt_java</tt> in the file 
<tt>/etc/modules</tt>.
Alternatively, you can install the module from the command line by
executing the command <tt>insmod DIRNAME/binfmt_java.o</tt> where 
<tt>DIRNAME</tt> is the name of the directory where the modules that
have been built for the version of the kernel now running are stored.
On a system with the 2.0.0 version of the kernel, 
<tt>DIRNAME</tt> is likely to be <tt>/lib/modules/2.0.0/fs/</tt>.
You can check that a module is loaded using the command
<tt>lsmod</tt>.
<P>
Running a Java applet requires a browser with the capability to 
recognize and execute them.  The Netscape browser that can be installed 
as a Debian package will run Java applets.  (The Netscape source code 
is not publicly available.  The Debian netscape package provides 
a wrapper which aids the installation
and management of Netscape on a Debian system.  This is actually a good
example of the integration of commercial packages with the Debian system.)
<P>
<!--
META:  Check whether/how Netscape can run Java programs.
-->
<P>
A final note of mixed blessings:  
Sun's licensing policies on the JDK are becoming more restricted with time,
so this package may not be available as part of Debian soon.
It is possible that it may be available in the same way that Netscape is
available for Debian Linux.  Better news is that a number of programs are 
currently being developed with may provide attractive publicly-available 
alternatives.

<sect1>What are all those directories (stable/development/non-free/contrib/project) at the Debian FTP archives?<label id="dirtree">
<P>
The software that has been packaged for Debian GNU/Linux is
available in one of several directory trees on each Debian mirror site.

<sect2>Top-level Directories
<P>
<descrip>
<tag/The Major Package Trees:/

<itemize>
<item>Debian-1.3/:
This directory contains the packages which formally constitute the most
recent release of the Debian Linux system.  
The contents of this directory do not change.  

<item>Debian-1.3-updates/:
Updates to the current release are in this directory.

<item>Debian-1.3.x/, a.k.a. &dquot;stable/&dquot;:
A copy of the current release with the updates applied.  The
minor number is changed whenever new updates are added. 

<item>&dquot;non-free/&dquot;:  This directory contains packages 
whose distribution is restricted in a way which requires that
distributors take careful account of the specified copyright requirements.  
For example, some packages have licenses which prohibit commercial
distribution.  Others can be redistributed but are in fact shareware 
and not freeware.  The licenses of each of these packages must be
studied, and possibly negotiated, before the packages are included in
any redistribution (e.g., in a CD-ROM). 

<item>&dquot;contrib/&dquot;: This directory contains packages which 
are <em>freely distributable</em>, but do not meet the policy requirements for 
distribution by the Debian project for some reason, e.g., the packages
have some unusual restriction on modification by other users, or are
only available in binary form.  For such packages, the project cannot given
the user any means to assure that they are free of Trojan horses, and 
cannot port them to other architectures.  Binary-only packages which
are not freely redistributable are placed in the <tt>non-free</tt> directory.

</itemize>

<tag/Supplementary directories:/

<itemize>

<item>&dquot;tools/&dquot;:  DOS utilities for creating boot disks, partitioning
your disk drive, compressing/decompressing files, and booting Linux.

<item>&dquot;upgrades/&dquot;: Files needed for upgrading a debian-0.93 system
(based on <tt>a.out</tt> binary format files) to Debian-1.1 (or later, 
based on <tt>ELF</tt> binary files).
Included are instructions for upgrading (either &dquot;manually&dquot; using
<tt>dpkg</tt>, or more automatically, using <tt>dselect</tt>),
along with a copy of the particular version of the package management 
tool, <tt>dpkg</tt> that must be used in <tt>a.out</tt> systems to 
start the upgrade, 
and a list of files that will be needed in order to do the upgrade.

<item>&dquot;doc/&dquot;:  Documentation, instructions on how to submit 
bug reports.

</itemize>

<tag/Of particular interest to developers:/

<itemize>
<item>&dquot;development/&dquot;:  A snapshot  of the current development
system.  Users are welcome to use and test these packages, but are 
warned about their state of readiness.

<item>&dquot;project/experimental/&dquot;: This directory contains packages
and tools which are being developed specifically for the Debian project,
and are still in the testing stage.  Users are welcome to use and test these
packages, but warned about their state of readiness. 

<item>&dquot;private/project/Incoming/&dquot;:  Packages that have been
uploaded by developers, and which are awaiting placement in the directory
hierarchy by the distribution maintainer.  

<item>&dquot;indices/&dquot;:  Various lists, including the 
<tt>Packages-Master</tt> file.

</itemize>

</descrip>

<sect2>Sub-directories
<P>
Within each of the major directory trees (<tt>stable/</tt>,
<tt>non-free/</tt>, <tt>contrib/</tt>, and <tt>development/</tt>, but 
not <tt>project/experimental/</tt>), which is too small to subdivide), 
the binary packages reside in sub-directories whose names indicate the 
chip architecture for which they were compiled:  
<itemize>
<item>binary/, which is normally a link to binary-i386/.

<item>binary-all/, for packages which are architecture-independent.  These
include, for example, Perl scripts.

<item>binary-i386/, for packages which execute on 80x86 machines.

<item>binary-m68k/, for packages which execute on machines based on one 
of the Motorola 680x0 processors.  Currently this is done mainly for 
Atari and Amiga computers, and also for some VME based industry standard 
boards.  There is no port of Linux to the old m68k based Macintoshes,
because Apple did not supply the needed hardware information.

<item>binary-sparc/, for packages which execute on Sun Sparcstations.

<item>binary-alpha/, for packages which execute on DEC Alpha machines.
</itemize>


<sect1>Is source code included with the system?
<P>
Source code is included for everything in the Debian system. 
Most of the license terms of programs in the system <em>require</em> that 
source code be distributed along with the programs, or that an offer to provide
the source code accompany the programs.  
<P>
Source code may or may not be available for packages in the 
&dquot;contrib&dquot; and &dquot;non-free&dquot; directories, which are
not formally part of the Debian system.

<sect1>How can I check that I am using a Debian system?  
<P>
The existence of the program <tt>dpkg</tt> shows that you should be able to install Debian packages on your system. 

In order to make sure that your system has been installed from the
real Debian base disks check for the existence of
<tt>/etc/debian_version</tt>.

<sect1> 
How can I tell what &dquot;version&dquot; of the Debian system I am using?
<P>
There is a file, <tt>/etc/debian_version</tt>, which contains
a single one-line entry giving the version number of the release,
as defined by the package <tt>base</tt>.
<P>
Users should be aware, however, that the Debian system consists
of many parts, each of which can be updated (almost) independently.
Each Debian &dquot;release&dquot; contains well defined and unchanging
contents.  Updates are separately available.  For a one-line description
of the installation status of package <tt>foo</tt>, use the command
<tt>dpkg --list foo</tt>.  (With no arguments, this command prints out
versions of all installed packages.)  For a more verbose description,
use <tt>dpkg --status foo</tt>.

<sect1>
How does Debian support non-English languages? <label id="nonEngl">
<P>
<itemize>
<item>Debian GNU/Linux is distributed with keymaps for nearly two dozen 
keyboards, and with utilities (in the <tt>kbd</tt> package) to install, view, 
and modify the tables.
The installation prompts the user to specify the keyboard he will use.
<P>
<item>Support for French-, German-, Italian- and Spanish-language manual pages is
provided through the <tt>manpages-fr</tt>, <tt>manpages-de</tt>, <tt>manpages-it</tt> and
<tt>manpages-es</tt> packages.  To access an NLS manual page, the user
must set LC_MESSAGES to the appropriate string.  In the case of the
German-language manual pages, LC_MESSAGES must be set to 'de_DE'.  The
<tt>man</tt> program will then search for German manual pages under
<tt>/usr/man/de_DE/</tt>.  
</itemize>

<sect1>
What about the US export regulation limitations?
<p>
US laws place restrictions on the export of defense articles, which
includes some types of cryptographic software. PGP and ssh fall into
this category.
<p>
To prevent anyone from taking unnecessary legal risks, certain Debian
GNU/Linux packages are only available from a non-US site <url
url="ftp://os.inf.tu-dresden.de:/pub/debian-non-US/">, there is a list of
mirror sites <url
url="ftp://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/pub/debian-non-US/README.mirrors">
