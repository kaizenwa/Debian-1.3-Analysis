<sect1>Where/how can I get the Debian installation disks?
<P>
You can get the installation disks by downloading the appropriate files
from the Debian FTP site: <url url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/">
and its <url url="http://www.debian.org/ftplist.html" name="mirrors">.

Please follow the instructions given in the Installation Guide.
It is available in the files 
<tt><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/stable/disks-i386/current/install.txt"
	name="install.txt"></tt> (ASCII) and
<tt><htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/stable/disks-i386/current/install.txt"
	name="install.html"></tt> (HTML).

Some special cases are mentioned below.


<sect1>How do I get and install the Debian from CD-ROM?<label id="cdrom">
<P>
Linux supports the ISO 9660 (CD-ROM) file system with Rock Ridge extensions 
(formerly known as &dquot;High Sierra&dquot;).  Several vendors provide
Debian in this format; these vendors have directly supported
the Debian project:
<itemize>
  <item>iConnect Corp.: i-Connect.Net provides the master FTP system used by
    Debian developers, and its network connection and system administration.
<!-- XXX keep numbers up-to-date -->
    They provide our 168 developers with free accounts on a system that is
    exclusively for our use, and they run our DNS domain. They also maintain
    several Debian packages.  Use the following contact info to order their
    CD-ROM:
    <itemize>

    </itemize>

  <item>Flexible Software:  This company maintains 8 Debian
    packages, and puts a lot of manpower into supporting users on the
    debian-user mailing list and refining the system design with our
    developers. They have carefully documented the development of one 
    of the two methods used to upgrade from Debian 0.93 to Debian 1.1.

<sect1>How can I get/install the Debian from a set of floppy disks?<label id="floppy">
<P>
Copy the Debian packages onto formatted floppy disks.  Either a DOS, 
the native Linux &dquot;ext2&dquot;, or the &dquot;minix&dquot; format will 
do; one just has to use a mount command appropriate to the floppy
being used.
<P>
Using floppy disks has these complications:
  <itemize>
  <item>Short MS-DOS filenames: If you are trying to place Debian package
     files onto MS-DOS formatted disks, you will find that their names 
     are generally too long, and do not conform to the MS-DOS 8.3 filename 
     limitation.  To overcome this,
     Debian developers make all of their packages available by 8.3 filenames 
     in separate &dquot;msdos&dquot; subdirectories (
     <tt>stable/msdos-i386/</tt>, <tt>non-free/msdos-i386/</tt>, 
     <tt>contrib/msdos-i386/</tt>, and <tt>development/msdos-i386/</tt>).
     The files in these 
     subdirectories are merely symbolic links to the Debian archive files; 
     they only differ from the files in the <tt>binary-i386/</tt>, etc. 
     directories by having shorter file names.
    <item>Large file sizes:  Some packages are larger than 1.44 MBytes, and 
     will not fit onto a single floppy disk.  To solve this problem, use the 
     <ref id="dpkgsplt" name="dpkg-split"> tool, available in the 
     <tt>tools</tt> directory at <url url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/">
     and its 
     <url url="http://www.debian.org/ftplist.html" name="mirrors">.
  </itemize>

  <P>
  You must have support in the kernel for floppy disks in order to read and 
  write to floppy disk; most kernels come with floppy drive support 
  included in them.
  <P>
  To mount a floppy disk under the mount point <tt>/floppy</tt> (a directory which 
  should have been created during installation), use:
  <itemize>
    <item><tt>mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /floppy/</tt>
     if the floppy disk is in drive A: and has an MS-DOS filesystem, 
    <item><tt>mount -t msdos /dev/fd1 /floppy/</tt>
     if the floppy disk is in drive B: and has an MS-DOS filesystem, 
    <item><tt>mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy/</tt>
     if the floppy disk is in drive A: and has an ext2 (i.e., a normal Linux) 
     filesystem.
  </itemize>

<sect1>How can I get and install Debian directly from a remote ftp site?<label id="anonftp">
<P>
Install the Debian tool <ref id="dpkgftp" name="dpkg-ftp">.  This package
is currently installed in the directory <tt>development/binary-all/net</tt>
at <url url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/"> and its 
<url url="http://www.debian.org/ftplist.html" name="mirrors">.
For details on installing a package, see notes on <ref id="dpkg" name="dpkg">.
<P>
Then invoke the program <tt>dselect</tt>, which will call <tt>dpkg-ftp</tt>
for you, guide you through the selection of packages, then install the packages,
without every downloading the packages themselves to your machine.
This method is designed to save the user both disk space and time.
Note that no special kernel configuration is needed to access and
install Debian packages by this method.
<P>
To use this service of <tt>dselect</tt>, you will need to know:
<itemize>
<item>the fully qualified domain name of the anonymous ftp site you
plan to use.
<item>the directory which contains the files you want to install, or the
subdirectories which contain files you want to install.  This directory
must contain a file called &dquot;Packages&dquot; (or its compressed
equivalent, &dquot;Packages.gz&dquot;).
</itemize>
<!-- XXX potential /var overflow -->

<sect1>How can I get and install Debian from a tape?<label id="atape">
<P>
At present, installing packages directly from tape is not supported.
One can however, use <tt>tar</tt>, <tt>cpio</tt>, or <tt>afio</tt> to
copy Debian archive files onto a tape, then copy them onto your local 
disk for installation.  In the same vein, floppy disks 
containing &dquot;tar&dquot; files would have to be copied onto a 
local disk before they could be managed with the Debian package tools.

<sect1>What is the latest version of Debian?<label id="version">
<P>
Currently there are three versions of Debian: 
<itemize>
<item>&dquot;1.3&dquot: this is stable software, 
and will not change. 
<item>&dquot;1.3.x&dquot;, a.k.a. &dquot;stable&dquot;, a.k.a &dquot: this 
is stable software, but it may change when major fixes are incorporated.
<item>the &dquot;development&dquot; version;
<!-- empty label -->
<label id="development">.  This is the version currently under
development; it is updated continuously. 
You can retrieve packages from the &dquot;development&dquot; archive on 
any Debian FTP site and use them to upgrade your system at any time. 
<p>
It is planned that this will become a new Debian release about three months after the last release.
</itemize>
