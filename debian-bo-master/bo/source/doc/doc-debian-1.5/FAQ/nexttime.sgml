<sect>What kind of changes should I expect to see in the next major release of Debian Linux? <label id="Future">
<P>

<sect1>Increased security
<P>
Debian now has Shadow password.
<P>
In addition, the Linux library of Pluggable Authentication Modules 
(<url url="http://parc.power.net/morgan/Linux-PAM/">; 
a.k.a. <tt>libpam</tt>) that allow sysadmins to choose authorization modes
on an application-specific basis will be available, and initially set to
authenticate via shadow password.

<sect1>More Support for non-English users
<p>
Debian already has some 
<ref id="nonEngl" name="support for non-English users">.
We hope to find people who provide support for even more languages.
<p>
Some programs already support internationalization, so we need message 
catalogs. Many programs still must be internationalized.
<p>
The GNU Translation Project <url
url="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS"> works on
internationalizing the GNU programs. 


<sect1>More architectures
<p>
Currently a complete Debian release is only available for the i386 
architecture. Complete Debian system on other architectures are expected soon.
