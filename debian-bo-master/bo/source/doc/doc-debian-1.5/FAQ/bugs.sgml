<sect>The Debian Bug Report System<label id="Bugs">
<sect1>Are there logs of known bugs?<label id="Buglogs">
<P>
The Debian Linux distribution has a bug tracking system which files 
details of bugs reported by users and developers. Each bug is given a 
number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt with. 

Copies of this information are available at <url
url="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">.


A mail server provides access to the bug tracking system database via
e-mail.  In order to get the instructions send an e-mail to
request@bugs.debian.org with "help" in the body.


<sect1>How do I report a bug in Debian?<label id="bugrpt">
<P>
If you have found a bug in Debian, please read the instructions for reporting
a bug in Debian.  These instructions can be obtained in one of several ways:
<itemize>
<item>By anonymous ftp.  Debian mirror sites contain the instructions in the
file <tt>doc/bug-reporting.txt</tt>.  
<item>From the WWW.  A copy of the instructions is shown at
<url url="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting.html">
<item>On any Debian system with the <tt>doc-debian</tt> package installed.
The instructions are in the file <tt>/usr/doc/debian/bug-reporting.txt</tt>.  
</itemize>

Use these mail addresses for bugs:
<itemize>
<item>submit@bugs.debian.org:  for general bug reports.  Expect to
get an automatic acknowledgement of your bug report.  It will also be
automatically given a bug tracking number, entered into the bug log 
and forwarded to the debian-devel mailing list.
<item>maintonly@bugs.debian.org:  to send bug reports to the maintainer
only. It will not be forwarded to the debian-devel mailing list.
For example, if one were to identify a bug that was common to many programs,
then rather than entering dozens of bug reports, one might prefer to
send individual bugs to maintonly, then send a summary report to 
debian-devel.
<item>quiet@bugs.debian.org:  to submit bug reports to the bug log only, 
without having them sent either to debian-devel or to the maintainer.
</itemize>
