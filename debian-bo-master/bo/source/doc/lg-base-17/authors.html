<P> <HR> <P> 
Now that <i>Linux Journal</i> has taken over <i>Linux Gazette</i> from John Fisk,
we need you. Anyone wishing to submit Linux tips and tricks or short
articles on Linux related subjects for publication in the <i>Gazette</i>, please
send your material to <a href="mailto:gazette@ssc.com">gazette@ssc.com</a>. 
<P> 
My plan is to post a new issue of the <i>Gazette</i> 
on the last working day of each month. Whether or not this happens will 
depend on writers getting articles to me each month. You will need to submit 
any articles -- full size or just quick tips and tricks -- to me at least 
a week before the end of the month for it to be included in the next month's 
issue. Basically you may send articles whenever and as often as you like -- 
the date received will only determine in which issue it will be placed. By 
the way, sending your articles already tagged for HTML would be a big help.
<P> 
Also, <i>Linux Journal</i> will have some space for a <i>Linux Gazette</i>
page and/or pages. I'm going to take as much space as the <i>LJ</i> editor 
will
allow me to print as much as I can of the neat stuff that you send. So your
articles will appear first on-line in the <i>Gazette</i> and then possibly 
again in hard copy print in <i>LJ</i> magazine.  
<P> 
Any ideas or suggestions you would like to make about the <i>Gazette</i> 
will be welcome.
