Welcome fellow intrepid surfing type dudes!  Well, last month was a slow one surfing wise. I've been hard at work trying to 
fix several problems which croped up while doing last issues' Web and Caldera aritcles. Let's see; <b>Perl</b> quit working; 
my  e-mail system had a problem; right smack in the middle of working on that my ISP underwent some major revisions
which took time to complete, <b>and</b>
<p> 
My Netscape trial period also had to expire.  
<p>
When it rains.......
<p>
I want to give a big hearty welcome to Laurie who is doing a monthly column devoted to Q&A. 
<p> 
Big Tip Laurie: BACKUP your machine!! Often.
<p>
For this months <b>Cool Sites</b>, I plugged my grandsons into the keyboard and they found a place to visit and talk about their
favorite video games.  I had to ummm...well, you know!...HEY! they would've <b>hogged</b> my computer all night!
Anyway, Cool Sites is devoted to children and video game stuff for both big and small kids.  Enjoy.

<h3>TkNet</h3>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tknet.gif">
<p>
Nope, not another service provider or network thingy; TkNet is an utility to manage a PPP/SLIP dialup account with the 
emhasis on <i><b>ease of use and maintainability.</i></b>
<p>
Is TkNet easy to use?  Yes.  I was able to set the program up for PPP simply by entering the name of the script file I 
normally use as root whenever I want to dial up the  ol'ISP. E-Mail routines can be configured as well. TkNet includes 
an application launcher which is also easy to configure.
<p>
<strong>The Launcher Setup </strong><img align=middle src="tknet_launch.gif">

<p>
One minor complaint: I don't 'get' the <b>QUIT</b> button. Not only does it Quit TkNet, but also kills the ppp daemon.
Hmmm...thought killing the ppp daemon was the job of the <b>Disconnect</b> button.

3DO.  Gotta get this machine.  Check out <a href="http://www.3do.com">3DO's home page</a> and you can find out
what makes this a 'must have' toy.  MPEG video, 3-D video, <b>and</b> surround sound all make the other game machines seem a 
little flat.  <b>3DO</b> was founded in 1994 and is the largest software development company focusing on 32/64 bit programing.
I also love the ability to download video clips of <b><i>Blade Force</b></i>.  WOW. Too way cool game.
<p>
Speaking of games, check out the games price difference between any system and 3DO.  3DO prices are a lot cheaper, sometimes <b>$18.00</b>
cheaper!

<p>
Maybe I don't have to buy the machine, maybe I can just buy the software and pop it into the computers CD-ROM. 
Huh? Has Ed spent too many nights staring at the screen?  Finally unable to tell the televisions' remote from the mouse?  
<b>Nope!</b>  Check out the 3DO web site and find out what I'm talking about.

<strong>Turtle <img src=" turtle_trax1.gif "> Trax</strong>
<p>
Seems like you can't talk about kids and computers without talking about education.  Stumbling around cyberspace, the boys
found this way cool site about <a href="http://www.io.org/~bunrab/">Marine Turtles.</a>  Turtle Trax, located on the island
of Maui Hi, is devoted to marine turtles.  Drop in somethime and say howdy.
