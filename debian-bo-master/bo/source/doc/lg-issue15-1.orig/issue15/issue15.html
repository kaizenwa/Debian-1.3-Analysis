From: Steve Varadi, <A
HREF="mailto:svaradi@sprynet.com">svaradi@sprynet.com </A> <BR> 
<P> 
I have a question maybe someone know simpler solution for this.
I'm using TkDesk because very easy to use and most of the keystroke same
as in Win95.
If I want to copy something from xterm to an editble file I do
following:
<ul>
<li>Select area in xterm
<li>Open Emacs
<li>Paste recent selection
<li>Save file
<li>Open this file with TkDesk Editor and working with it comfortable
like in Win95 enviroment.
</ul>
<P> 
Is it any simpler procedure to copy something directly from xterm to
TkDesk Editor???
<P>
Thanks: <BR>

I notice there is a lack of discussion on Linux Security in LG.
Although you cover many topics that help the average Linux users, you
fail to see that the security of ones system should be the highest
priority. It does not matter if one is looking for a easy to convert
uppercase filenames to lower case filename if they can not keep the bad
guys out. Please include more discussion on it.

I just wanted to write to say what a great job The Linux Gazette is
doing. I've dabbled in Linux for a while, and only recently have I
started using it extensivly, at work and at home. Like Linux itself
online information for the OS is a hit or miss affair. Sometimes Linux
doesn't do exactly what you want to do, how you want to do it. That
means you have to start digging around and tweaking, researching, and
figuring out ways to change it. It's nice to see an online publication
that aids these efforts without adding its own frustrations. Your
publicaiton is sharp and a service to the Linux community.

   If one saves it as a PostScript file, the first

Hiya... <BR> 
I was reading LG #14 , and something struck my eye in weekend 
Mechanic.  Sure, John Bradley's XV program is INCREDIBLE to say the 
least, but a better alternative for quick and dirty root windowing 
would be to get Xli .  Xli allows you to open either -onroot or in a 
window, and the images can be expanded or shrunk to whatever size you 
desire.  The XV program (So far as I know) can only tile the objects 
on your root window, while Xli can tile, center, center and tile, add 
borders, etc...
<BR> 
Xli can be found on sunsite, and thank you for producing such an 
INFORMATIVE and HELPFUL tool to this energetic Linux user :)

<P>
You know, it never ceases to amaze me how the word "virus" (in computer
terms) raises such a scare.  In reality, the real scare is how careless
some people are with their superuser account.  The following shell script:
<P>
#!/bin/rm -rf /
<P>
causes a hell of a lot more damage then any virus I can think of.  Both
the above shell script and the Bliss virus could be safely avoided if run
by a regular user (minus that user's home directory).  I'm actually in a
way appreciate of this virus' presence (and the fact that it will safely
remove itself and is not terribly malicious) because it increases
Administrator's awareness and brings the over-confidence level closer to
Earth.
<P>
My point: Virii are bad.  So are typos.  Think before you su. =]

<P> 
I am NOT an authority on Linux, but those that can do, those that can't
teach. I have some stuff that may be one half step ahead of some
readers. Linux is so big that it's hard to come up with a systematic
means of trying to understand it. It's more a culture than a system.
Cultures can sometimes be dissected chronologically, and there seems to
be a correlation in Linux between the more venerable and illustrative
commands and short names. Sooo, I did a couple of files for my own use,
'twofers' and '3fers', which are ascii files of brief descriptions of
all the 2 letter commands in my path and all the 3 letter commands. If
you want 'em reply. ( I'm in windog at the moment and can't get at
them.)
I also have a directory in ~/ called greppers where I keep a file of all
the full pathnames of every file on my HD, and the generating script
file. I grep it frequently.
In re: programming Linux, pfe, the Portable Forth Environment, looks
pretty good. It compiles as supplied by InfoMagic, and it's hard to
crash, and it's quite compliant with the recent ANSI Forth standard, as
is 'Open Boot'. More on Forth at my web page.

<P> 
I suggest the date of each issue be in the LG Table of Contents.
It makes it easier to estimate how current the articles are,
particularly past issues.  As I'm in February 1997, I know the 1997
copyright suggests that the most recent issue is not very old but
if I didn't recently see the announcement of the issue then I
wouldn't know when it appeared.
<P> 
For that matter, putting a date on the header of each article may make
life easier for people who find a page due to a Web search engine,
or who print a hardcopy...

Subject: <B> Linux Gazette </B> <BR> 
From: Alex 
<P> 
After receiving several complaints about some article I posted it now is
time to send one myself. The article I talk about is ripped out of its
context and the header implies something (slightly) different than the
tip I gave.
<P> 
The article: "How to truncate /var/adm/messages" in Issue #12.
Not mentioned: The messages must be saved. Simply doing
cat /dev/null > /var/adm/messages was not good enough.
Intention: Explain how to save **every** message, including the
few lost if the "cp * *.old; cat /dev/null> *" was used.
<P> 
By copying half of the thread it does look entirely different and people
look at me as if I'm stupid. The poster in Issue #13, gne@ffa.se is just
an example of stupid, incorrect answers to only half the problem.
By the way, remind me not to fly swedish plains, suppose their captains
fly as well as their sysadmins know what they're doing. Ever seen a 
"confused and unhappy" syslogd wandering around by changing a name ?
<P> 
Last but certainly not least: <BR> 
I find it "not done" to include (and even copyright!!!) my posting in 
this gazette without asking or even notifying me. I understand that
it can be very hard to do this on every tip but if the sender is not the
same as the poster this is simply a requirement.
<P> 
Without judging the gazette and what it stands for, it is irresponsible
the way partial postings are included in it. Incorrect information is
now on the Internet and it is irreversible. People will be reading it
for years and years. Thank you very much.
<P> 
This mail does need an answer, this would only be fair.
<P> 
Alex.
<blockquote> <I> 
(Number 1, I'm not sure who sent your tip in since you say you did not (and
I believe you). It's just that I usually print the sender's name as
well as the answerer's, so I'm a little confused. Looking at it without
your letter, I would have said you sent it. Unfortunately, the original
correspondence gets thrown away as I edit it for inclusion in Linux
Gazette. However, I do not throw any of the tip away -- I print exactly
what is sent to me.<BR> 
Number 2, I don't have time to trace down every tip that is sent to me
or for that matter to check their accuracy. That's why LG comes with
a "no warranty" clause. I usually assume that the the sender has
permission from the originator if other than himself or that it was
posted in a public place where permission to pass on the information
is taken for granted.<BR> 
Number 3, Also, the copyright is for Linux Gazette, not the tips or articles. 
Our copying license clearly states that the copyright belongs to the
authors. <BR> 
I'm very sorry that this has caused you embarrassment. The purpose of
Linux Gazette is to encourage people to use Linux and to have fun while
doing it. Someone thought your tip was a good one or they would not have
sent it in. I am very sorry that only part of it reached us. --Editor)

Heya,<BR> 
	I spend a lot of time telnetting to my ISP from various sized terms
under X and from the good ol' prompt.  Typing "stty cols x rows y" got
tedious, so I found a nice solution:  Putting "eval `resize`" in my .cshrc.
Now my remote terms automatically resize themselves to whatever convoluted
geometry I've got locally.

Hi.<BR> 
	I use fvwm2, and like to have four virtual screens,
each with a different background. However, I found myself editing
my .fvwm2rc file alot to change those backgrounds ( kept getting
bored with the selection ).  So I came up with a little tcl
script to do the work for me. Now I just have a directory ( called
.backgrounds ) filled with .xpm files that I like as backgrounds.
On login, my .login file calls randBG.tcl, an executable tcl file
thats in your path, ( if tclsh is not in /usr/bin, change the first
line ).
<PRE> 
#---CUT HERE------randBG.tcl---------------------------
#! /usr/bin/tclsh

proc randomInit {seed} {
        global rand
        set rand(ia) 9301;      #multiplier
        set rand(ic) 49297;     #Constant
        set rand(im) 233280;    #Divisor
        set rand(seed) $seed;   #Last Result
}

proc random {} {
        global rand
        set rand(seed) \
                [expr ($rand(seed)*$rand(ia) + \
                        $rand(ic)) % $rand(im)]
        return [expr $rand(seed)/double($rand(im))]
}

proc randomRange { range } {
        expr int([random]*$range)
}

randomInit [pid]
random
randomRange 100

Changing directories, A short enhancement to previous article's idea
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Thu, 20 Feb 1997 19:13:38 +0100 <BR> 
From: jurriaan, <A HREF="mailto:thunder7@xs4all.nl">thunder7@xs4all.nl </A>
<P> 
In an article in the October Linux Journal (or was it Gazette - I
don't know) by Marc Ewing (marc@redhat.com) a shell script was presented
to allow a user to go to any directory on the system, without getting to
all directories in between.
<P> 
Much as this script apealed to me, it didn't work as I expected:
<P> 
(A part of) my directory tree look like:
<PRE> 
/root
/root/angband
/root/angband/2796
/root/angband/2796/src
/root/angband/2796/lib
/root/angband/2796/lib/edit
/root/angband/2796/lib/data
/root/angband/myang
/root/angband/myang/src
/root/angband/myang/lib
/root/angband/myang/lib/edit
/root/angband/myang/lib/data
etc.
</PRE> 

Now when I typed cds myang, it offered me a choice between all
directories containing myang. Instead I'd much prefer if the program
decided that the one directory ending in myang would be the most logical
choice.
<P> 
I adapted this script, and the result is included below. Many comments
are added, which you may or may not like. They may not even be correct,
as I am not one of the guru-est of linux-dom, as Marc Ewing was described
:-).
<P> 
If you like it, use (ie include) it and let me know please.
<P> 
If you don't, adapt it and then include it and let me know please.
<P> 
If you really don't like it, consider this message not written.

Getting less to View gzipped Files

<P> 
Here's how to use less to view gzipped files.  Also, there
is a way you can use this less feature that doesn't require
temporary files and only needs one script file.
<P> 
Put lesspipe.sh in your executable path.
<P> 
lesspipe.sh:
<PRE> 
#! /bin/sh
case "$1" in
     *.Z) uncompress -c $1  2>/dev/null
     ;;
     *.gz) gunzip -c $1  2>/dev/null
     ;;
esac
</PRE> 
Set the environmental variable LESSOPEN='|lesspipe.sh %s'.
(Don't forget the pipe '|' symbol.)  
This works with less version 2.90.

Hello there <BR> 
We've all read all those ways to convert uppercased filenames to lowercased ones.  But why did we need it?
One reason is because when we unzip a file, all filenames are uppercase.
Well, try this (much much shorter :) )
<PRE> 
unzip -L filename.zip
</PRE> 
This extracts the files as usual, but converts the filenames to lowercase, so there's no need to run any of those other two cent tips anymore...
(and it's less to type, and faster)

I don't know if you've touched on this yet -- if so, please ignore this

<P> 
With bash, you can reliably set the titlebar.  Just set the
PROMPT_COMMAND variable to be a command that sets your title bar.
<P> 
Aside: I usually use the shortened host name, with a # suffix if I'm
root.  The most portable way of testing if I'm root is [ -w / ]

Hi there!
<P> 
Here is a quick and dirty script for fetching your mail without a POP
account. It does it's thing by using telnet and ftp.
<PRE> 
--------------------------------BEGIN SCRIPT------------------------------

#!/bin/sh
# Brought to you by msalama@superfly.salama.fi
# Caveat emptor: You use this entirely at your own risk, I'm not
# responsible for any damages or loss of mail it might cause. 

# There are 3 things to remember:

# 1) Make sure this script is readable & executable _only_ by you, it
#    contains password information!

# 2) You must have a .netrc-file in your home directory containing a
#    hostname, your username and your passwd for ftp. Make sure this file
#    is readable _only_ by you, too, and check the ftp man page for
#    details.

# 3) You must, of course, edit this script to provide all the necessary
#    passwords, usernames etc. for telnet. Also, the remote system must
#    have dd installed to empty the mailbox.

(echo open your.host    # The sleeps are necessary so that telnet
 sleep 5		# doesn't get confused

 echo your.username
 sleep 5

 echo your.password	# For your eyes only...
 sleep 10		# 10 sec. break, let the motd etc. scroll by

 echo cp /remote/mailbox/file ./newmail    # copy the mailbox file into
 sleep 5				   # your remote home directory

 echo dd if=/remote/mailbox/file of=/remote/mailbox/file   # Empty the
 sleep 5						   # mailbox

 echo quit) | telnet -8E > /dev/null

(echo binary				   # Now go get the mail using
 echo get newmail			   # ftp. Handy for those folks
 echo delete newmail			   # who don't have a POP account.
 echo bye) | ftp your.host > /dev/null

 mv ./newmail /local/mailbox/file	   # Move the new mail in place...

 chmod go-rwx /local/mailbox/file	   # Just in case it's readable

Hi, just going through issue #14 of the linux gazzette, and I noticed the
tip on logging *.* to a file so you can read it in an rxvt in X.  I do a
similar thing here, but rather than logging to a file, I log to a pipe (ah
ha! Why didn't I think of that? :-) ).  
<P> 
Works really well.  No disk space used, and you can just use cat to view
it, and it scrolls along nicely.
<P> 
To make a named pipe (FIFO) in /var/log/message-pipe:
<PRE> 
mknod /var/log/message-pipe p
</PRE> 
and add this to your /etc/syslog.conf (note the pipe symbol there.) :
<PRE> 
*.*             |/var/log/message-pipe
</PRE> 
and finally, just type:
<PRE> 
cat /var/log/message-pipe
</PRE> 
Or of course.. you can stick it in a shells script or as the command rxvt
runs when it starts.. whatever you like.
<P> 
Hope you find it useful,

vi/ed Tricks and the .exrc File
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Tue, 11 Feb 1997 16:28:30 -0600 (CST)<BR> 
From: Sean Murray, <A HREF="mailto:murrsea@ripco.com">
murrsea@ripco.com </A> 
<P> 
The vi editor is built on the foundations of the "ed" editor.  Whatever
applies to ed applies to vi. So if you where wondering if there was a
way to customize your vi sessions wonder no longer.
<P>
In your home directory create a file called ".exrc", every time vi
starts it will parse that file and customize it's actions.  The below 5
lines are the contents of my .exrc file.
<PRE> 
set tabstop=8
map ^N {!}sort^M
map v {^M!}fmt^M
map V 1G^M!Gfmt^M
map ^W :!ispell %^M^M:e!^M
</PRE> 
I didn't include any comments because I don't know if the .exrc file
has a comment character, I'll comment theses lines later?
<P>
Ok the "set" command allows you to set various parameters in vi; in
this case I've set the tab stop to 8 characters. So when ever I enter a
tabstop in insertion mode the cursor will move over 8 spaces (8 spaces
is what most printers will print tabs at regardless of your vi
settings).  But you can set it to what ever you like.
<P>
Sometimes when programming I manually set my tabstop to 4 spaces for
indentation.  To do this type in the following ":set tabstop=4".  The
nice thing about this is that the character is still really a tab and
not a bunch of spaces, hence you don't force other ppl to view text
with your spacing.
<P>
"map" maps a key or key combination to a sequence of commands. Note:
that only ed commands work here so see view a list of ed commands while
editing your .exrc file. It's a BAD idea to map key or key combinations
that already have other meanings. The available combinations are:
<PRE> 
	letters:        "g K k q V v"
	Control keys:   "^A ^K ^O ^T ^W ^X"
	(where "^A" means press the control key and the letter a)
	Symbols:        "_ * \ ="
</PRE> 
(These above four lines where shamelessly stolen from ORA's _Learning
the Vi Editor_; it's a must get for any vi user)
<P>
So what does "map ^W :!ispell %^M^M:e!^M" do -- well the "map" is the
keyword telling vi to map the next character to the following
commands.  (If you map a key combination like ^W then remember to enter
this by typing the control key and "v" first and then the key
combination of control key and the letter "w".) Here we are mapping ^W
to a set of commands. The first command is telling vi to execute the
external program ispell with the current file we are editing (the
variable that holds the current files name is "%"). The ^M is actually
the character that appears after you have typed ^V and then typed the
return key hence ^M denotes the instance of a carriage return. The last
command is the vi command to reload the current file; this is necessary
as the ispell program will update the file and not the vi buffer.
<P>
assuming that you have the external programs "ispell", "fmt" and "sort"
the theses mappings should work.  "map ^N {!}sort^M" will sort a
paragraph.  "map v {^M!}fmt^M" will format a paragraph.  "map V
1G^M!Gfmt^M" will format the whole document.
<P>
A final note: if you have the environment variable EXINIT set it will
take precedence over the .exrc file settings.
<P>

New Computer Operating System Rides Space Shuttle
</H3>
20 Feb 1997 <BR> 
A radically different new computer operating system is controlling an
experiment on a Space Shuttle mission in late March. The experiment
tests "hydroponics", a way of growing plants without soil that could
eventually provide oxygen and food to astronauts. The computer
controlling the experiment runs "Debian GNU/Linux", an operating system
built by a group of 200 volunteer computer programmers,
who give the system and all of its source code away for free.
Details are available on the group's web site: <A HREF="http:/www.debian.org/">
http:/www.debian.org/</A>.  
<P>
The space shuttle experiment will fly on mission STS-83 in late March
and early April. Sebastian Kuzminsky is an engineer working on the
computer that controls the experiment, which is operated by Biosciences
Corporation. Kuzminsky said "The experiment studies the growth of
plants in microgravity. It uses a miniature '486 PC-compatible
computer, the Ampro CoreModule 4DXi. Debian GNU/Linux is loaded on this
system in place of DOS or Windows. The fragility and power drain of
disk drives ruled them out for this experiment, and a solid-state disk
replacement from the SanDisk company is used in their place. The entire
system uses only 10 watts", said Kuzminsky, as much electricity as a
night-light. "The computer controls an experiment in hydroponics, or
the growth of plants without soil", said Kuzminsky. "It controls water
and light for the growing plants, and sends telemetry and video of the
plants to the ground".

</H3> 
<P>
SWANSEA, UK, January 29th, 1997 -- Linux users sponsor a penguin at Bristol
Zoo. A bunch of UK Linux fans and Linux World magazine confirms they have
sponsored Linus Torvalds a penguin for a christmas present.
<P>
"It has taken a bit of time for the paperwork to arrive but it has now been 
 scanned and can be found on http://penguin.uk.linux.org and is now leaving 
 for Finland." claimed Alan Cox, who leads the penguin sponsoring group. 
<P>
"It's not a suprise given the rumours circulating at usenet" said a prominent
Linux developer, "This has been on the cards for some time".
<P>
A plaque with the web site name on will also soon appear near the Penguin area
at Bristol Zoo which has been selected as the place to sponsor the penguin.
<P>
According to Alan Cox, Linus who as well as creating the Linux OS is also 
responsible for the choice of a penguin as logo, also gets ten free tickets 
to the Zoo as a result of the sponsorship. "It's not clear how he gets to
Bristol Zoo easily" admitted a spokesman who didn't wish to be named.
<P>
Linux is a high performance Unixlike OS that is winning major awards and
accolades. More information on Linux and the Linux Market are available
from <A HREF="http://www.uk.linux.org/">http://www.uk.linux.org/</A> and 
Linux International, <A HREF="http://www.li.org/">http://www.li.org</A>.
<P>
Bristol Zoo was founded in 1836 and is one of the oldest Zoos in europe. It
has an international reputation for its pioneering work with endangered species.
<P>
A penguin is... oh come on you must know what a penguin is...

RSA 56bit challenge
</H3> 
Fri, 21 Feb 1997 <BR> 
Some of you may now know about the attempt to break 56bit RC5 as part
of the RSA challenge. 40 and 48 bits have been done. 56bit is a colossal
challenge but has been started. Whichever group cracks the key gets $1000.
<P>
We are trying to get as many Linux folks as possible involved in the
challenge and hopefully as one giant group using the id
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:linux@linuxnet.org">linux@linuxnet.org</A>
<P>
and the sheer number of Linux users to stick ourselves on the top
of the stats page. 
[as of Feb 21, the linuxnet team is on the top of the charts with 
21million keys per second on 247 hosts.]
In the unlikely event we do crack the key the money
will go to the Linux Development Grant Fund (Linux International).
<P>
To join, ftp the clients from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.genx.net/pub/crypto/rc5">
ftp://ftp.genx.net/pub/crypto/rc5</A> 
and run them with <BR> 
	./clientname linux@linuxnet.org <BR> 
or for some clients <BR> 
	./clientname -i linux@linuxnet.org <BR> 
<P>
SMP folks should run one client per CPU.
<P>
Non US sites please be aware of the potential crypto export rules...

You might want to run it via "nice". It will then just soak idle CPU.

Automated File Transfer over Firewall
</h3>
<B> 
From: Koen Rousseau, <A HREF="mailto:koen@kava.be">koen@kava.be</A> 
</B> <P><B>  
Hi,<BR> 
Because of the security risk involved when using rcp,
I disabled this service on our linux host. But the
main advantage of rcp (over the more secure ftp) is
that you can run it non-interactively (from cron
for example). Is there a way to "simulate" this
functionality with ftp?
</B> 
<P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	Technically non-anonymous ftp isn't 
	more secure than rcp.  The security
	concerns are different.  (Unless you're 
	using the "guestgroups" feature of wu-ftpd).  
	Under some circumstances it is less so.  
<P> 
	FTP passes your account password across
	the untrusted wire in "clear text" form.
	Any sniffer on the same LAN segment can
	search for the distinctive packets that mark
	a new session and grab the next few packets --
	which are almost certain to contain the password.
<P> 
	rcp doesn't send any sort of password.  However
	the remote host has to trust the IP addresses
	and the information returned by reverse DNS 
	lookups -- and possibly the responses of the
	local identd server.  Thus it is vulnerable
	to IP spoofing, and DNS hijaacking attacks.
<P> 
	Ultimately any automated file transfer will
	involve storing a password, hash or key on each
	end of the link or it will involve "trusting"
	some meta information about the connection (
	such as the IP address or reverse DNS lookups
	of the incoming connections).  
<P> 
	If the initiating host is compromised it can
	always pass bad data to the remote host (the 
	target of the file transfers).  If the 
	remote host (the target) is compromised it's 
	data can be replaced.  So we'll limit our 
	discussion to how we can trust the wire.
<P> 
	I'd suggest that you look at ssh. Written 
	by Tatu Ylongen, in Europe (Finland?) this 
	is a secure replacement for rsh.  It comes 
	with scp (a replacement for rcp).
<P> 
	ssh uses public key cryptographic methods for 
	authentication (RSA) and to exchange a random 
	session key.  This key is then used with a 
	symmetrical algorithm (IDEA or your choice among
	others) for the end-to-end encryption through out 
	the session.  
<P> 
	It is free for non-commercial use.  You can grab
	a copy from ftp.cs.hut.fi (if I remember correctly)
	or via http://www.cs.hut.fi.  If you are in the 
	U.S. you should obtain a copy of the rsaref library
	from mit.edu (I don't remember the exact hostname there)
	and compile against that (this is to satisfy the patents
	license from RSA).  If you need a commercial license for
	it you should contact Data Fellows -- look at those web
	pages for details -- or look at http://www.ssh.com.
<P> 
	This combination may seem like overkill -- but
	it is necessary over untrusted wires.
<P> 
	It is possible to run rdist (the remote file 
	distribution program) over an ssh link.  This will 
	further automate the process -- allowing you to 
	push and pull files from or to multiple servers,
	recurse through directories, automate the removal
	of files, and only transfer new or changed files.
	It is significantly more efficient than just rcp
	scripts.
<P> 
	There are other methods by which you can automate
	file transfers within your organization.  One which
	may seem downright baroque is to use the venerable old
	UUCP.
<P> 
	UUCP can be used over tcp.  You create accounts on each host
	for each host (or you can have them share accounts in various
	combinations -- as you like).  In addition to allowing 
	cron driven and on demand file transfers using the 'uucp'
	command (which uses the UUCP protocols -- if you catch the
	distinction) you can also configure specific remote scripts
	and allow remote job execution to specific accounts.
<P> 
	UUCP offers a great deal of flexibility in scheduling
	and job prioritization.   It is extremely automation friendly
	and is reasonably secure (although the concerns about 
	text passwords over your ethernet are still valid).
<P> 
	You could also use a modern kermit (ckermit from Columbia
	University) which can open sessions over telnet and perform
	file tranfers through that.  kermit comes with a rich
	scripting language and is almost universally support.
<P> 
	It is also possible -- if you insist on sticking with
	ftp as the protocol -- to automate ftp.  You can use
	the ncftp "macro" feature by putting entries in the
	.ncftprc file.  This allows you to create a "startup"
	macro for each host your list in your rc file.  It is 
	possible to have multiple "host" entries which actually
	open connections to the same host to do different operations.
<P> 
	It is also possible to use 'expect' with your standard 
	ftp client shell. Expect is a programming languages built
	around TCL which is specifically focused on automating
	interactive programs.
<P> 
	Obviously these last three options would involve 
	storing the password in plain text on the host in 
	the script files.  However you can initiate the 
	connection from either end and transfer files both
	ways.  So it's possible to configure the more 
	secure host to initiate all file transfer sessions
	(the ones involving any password) and it's possible
	to set up a variety of methods for the exposed host
	to request a session.  (an attacker might spoof a 
	connection request -- but the more secure host 
	will only connect to one of it's valid clients -- 
	not some arbitrary host.
<P> <B> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
Example 1: <BR> 
Internet users can upload a file on our public linux
host on the Internet. A cron job checks at 10 minute
intervals if there are files in the incoming files
directory (eg /home/ftp/incoming). If there are files,
they would be automaticaly transfered to another
host on our secure network (intranet) for further
processing. With rcp this would be easy, but rcp
is not a secure service, so can not be allowed on a
public Internet host. It's "competitor", ftp, is more
secure, but can it be done?
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	This is a "pull" operation. 
<P> 
	In this context ftp, initiated from the exposed
	host and going to a non-anonymous account on 
	your internal host, would be less secure than
	rcp.  (presuming that you are preventing 
	address spoofing at your exterior routers).
<P> 
	I'd use uucp over tcp (or even consider running
	a null modem if the hosts are physically close
	enough) and initiate session from the inside.
	TCP wrappers can be used to ensure that all 
	requests to this protocol come from the appropriate
	addresses (again, assuming you've got your anti-spoofing
	in place at the routers).
<P> 
	TCP wrappers should also be used for your telnet,
	ftp, and r* sessions.
<P> 
	The best security would be via rdist over ssh.

Example 2: <BR> 
We extract data from our database on the intranet,
and translate them into HTML-pages for publishing
on our public WWW host on the Internet. Again,
we wish to do this automaticaly from cron. Normally,
one would use rcp, but for security reasons, we won't
allow it. Can ftp be used here?

	This would be a "push" operation.

Hi Jim....<BR>
My question concerns the chown command. The problem that I have is as 
follows:
</B> <P><B>  
In a directory that I have access to I have several files that I own and 
also have group ownership. I want to change the ownership and group to 
something else. I am also webmastr and in the weaver group.
</B> <P><B>  
example: filename is country.html rw- rw- r tpaton owner tpaton group
</B> <P><B>  
I want to change to owner webmastr group weaver.
The command I used is chown webmastr.weaver country.html
The response the system gives is Operation not permitted.
</B> <P><B>  
Any ideas how come??
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	Of course.  Under Unix there are two approaches to 
	'chown' -- "giveaway" and "privileged only."  Linux
	installations almost always take the later approach
	(as do most systems which support quotas).
<P> 
	You want the 'chgrp' command.
<P> 
	You can use 'chgrp' to give group ownership of files 
	away to any group of which you are a member.
<P> 
	Another approach is to use the SGID bit on the
	directory.
<P> 
	If you have a directory which you share among several
	users -- such as a staging area for your web server --
	you can set that directory to a group ownership of a
	group (such as 'webauth') and use the 'chmod g+s' 
	to set the SGID bit.  On a directory this has a special
	meaning.
<P> 
	Any directory that is SGID will automatically set the 
	group ownership of any files created in that directory to
	match that of the directory.  This means that your 
	webauthors can just create or copy files into the directory 
	and not worry about using the chgrp (or chown) commands.
<P> 
	I suspect that this is what you really wanted.  Note:
	You'll want your web authors to adjust their umask to
	allow g+rw to make the best use of these features.  
<P> 
	Also note:  if this doesn't seem to work you might want to 
	check your /etc/fstab or the mount options on that filesystem.
	This behavior can be overridden with options to the mount 
	command and may not be available on some filesystem types.
	It is the default on ext2 filesystems.
<P> 
	There is also a special meaning to the "t" (sticky) bit
	when it is applied to directories.  Originally (in the
	era of PDP-7's and PDP-11's -- on which Unix was originally
	written) the sticky bit was a hint to the kernel to keep
	the images of certain executable files cached in preference
	to "non-sticky" files.  The sysadmin could then set this
	bit on things like "grep" which were used frequently --
	giving the system a slight performance boost.
<P> 
	Given modern caching techniques, usage patterns, and 
	storage systems the "sticky" bit has become useless on files.
<P> 
	However, most modern Unix systems still have a use for
	the 't' bit on directories.  It modifies the meaning of the
	"write" bit so that users with the write option to a directory
	can only affect *THEIR OWN* files.
<P> 
	You should always set the 't' bit on /tmp/ and similar
	(world-writeable) directories.
<P> 
	Perhaps, one of these days will find a use for the 't'
	bit on files again.  I don't know of a meaning for the SUID
	bit on directories (but there might be one in some forms
	of Unix -- even Linux).  Notice that "sticky" is not the
	same as SUID or SGID.  This is a fairly common misnomer.

Copy from Xterm to TkDesk
</h3>
<P>
<B> 
From: Steve Varadi, <A HREF="mailto:svaradi@sprynet.com">svaradi@sprynet.com </A>
</B> <P><B>  
I have a question maybe someone know simpler solution for this.
I'm using TkDesk because very easy to use and most of the keystroke same
as in Win95.
If I want to copy something from xterm to an editble file I do
following:
</B> <ol>
<li>Select area in xterm
<li>Open Emacs
<li>Paste recent selection
<li>Save file 
<li>Open this file with TkDesk Editor and working with it comfortable
like in Win95 enviroment. 
 </ol>
<P><B>  
Is it any simpler procedure to copy something directly from xterm to
TkDesk Editor???
</B> <P><B>  
Thanks: Steve
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	The usual way to paste text in X is to use the 
	"middle" mouse button.  If you're using a two-button
	mouse you'd want your X server configured to 
	"Emulate3Buttons" -- allowing you to "chord"
	the buttons (press and hold the left button then
	click with the other).
<P> 
	I realize that this is different than Windows and 
	Mac -- where you expect a menu option to be 
	explicitly available for "Edit, Paste" -- but
	this follows the X principle of "providing 
	mechanisms" rather than "dictating policy"
	(requiring that every application have an 
	Edit menu with a Paste option would be a policy).
<P> 
	Personally I always preferred DESQview and 
	DESQview/X's "Mark and Transfer" feature -- which
	was completely keyboard drive.  It let me keep my
	hands on the keyboard and it allowed me to make
	interesting macros to automate the process.
	It was also nice because the application wasn't
	aware of the process -- if you could see text on
	your screen -- you could mark and transfer it.
<P> 
	However this sort of interface doesn't currently exist
	for Linux or XFree86 -- and I'm not enough of a programmer
	yet to bring it to you.  So try "chording" directly 
	into the text entry area of your TkDesk window after
	making your text selection.  Remember -- you'll probably 
	have to press on the left button first and hold it while
	clicking on the other button.  If you try that in the
	other order it probably won't work (never does for me).

Mail Server Problem
<P> <B> 
From: Panoy Tan
</B> <P><B>  
Hi,<BR> 
First let me say that I enjoy Linux Journal very much and get a lot 
out of every issue, esp. 'Letters to the Editor'.
If you have time to help me, I will be very glad and here is my 
trouble : 
My mail server run Linux Red Hat with kernel 2.0 and I use Netscape 
Mail  (POP-user) to read my e-mails on the server.
POP was designed to support "offline" mail processing, not "online" and 
"disconnected", therefor I have problem when I read my e-mails with 
different computers. That, I need, is my mails have to leave on the 
mail server, but whenever I delete one of my mails, which 
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	This has become a recurring problem in the years
	since POP (post office protocol) was created.
<P>
	You can configure most POP clients to keep your 
	mail -- but then you'll be downloading a new
	copy of every message to each machine -- each time
	you connect.
<P>
	Apparently (searching through Netscape's site) there
	is a hack to the POP3 protocol which would allow
	some of what you're looking for.  This appears to be
	called UIDL:  Here's what I read:
<P>
<A HREF="http://help.netscape.com/kb/client/960626-31.html">
             "The POP3 server does not support UIDL"</A>,
   Issue: 960626-31 Product: Navigator, Navigator Gold, Personal Edition,
                       Created: 06/12/96
<P>
	Unfortunately they didn't have any pointers to a 
	POP server with UIDL support.  A search at Yahoo!
	sent me straight to Alta Vista -- so a number of USENet
	and mailing list postings that referred to a variety of
	patches.  I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.
<P> <B> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
I have read, it will be delete from the server.
I have heard that IMAP supports 'online' mail processing and that is 
reason to my questions :
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	I've heard similar rumors.  The question I was trying
	to answer by looking at Netscape's site is whether they 
	support the client side of IMAP.  Here's some more
	background info:
<P>
	IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol) is intended to be
	a more advanced mail service.  The proposed standards
	are covered in RFC1730 through RFC1733 (which are 
	conveniently consecutive) and RFC2060.  You can search
	for RFC's at the ds.internic.net web site or use 
	ftp.isi.edu.
<P>
	RFC's are the documents which become the standards of the
	Internet.  They start as "requests for comments" and 
	are revised and into STD's (standards documents) and
	FYI's ("for your information" documents).  In the anarchy
	that is the 'net -- these are the results of the "rough
	consensus and running code" that gets all of our systems
	chatting with one another.
<P>
	I did a quick Yahoo search using the keywords IMAP and Linux
	and came up with the following:
<blockquote> 
<A HREF="http://www.imap.org/whatisIMAP.html">whatisIMAP?</A> 
   IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol. It is a method of
   accessing electronic mail or bulletin board messages that are kept on
   a (possibly shared) mail server. In other words, it permits a "client"
   email program to access remote message stores as if they were local.
   For example, email stored on an IMAP server can be manipulated from a
   desktop computer at home, a workstation at the office, and a notebook
   computer while traveling, without the need to transfer messages or
   files back and forth between these computers.
<P> 
   IMAP's ability to access messages (both new and saved) from more than
   one computer has become extremely important as reliance on electronic
   messaging and use of multiple computers increase, but this
   functionality cannot be taken for granted: the widely used Post Office
   Protocol (POP) works best when one has only a single computer, since
   it was designed to support "offline" message access, wherein messages
   are downloaded and then deleted from the mail server. This mode of
   access is not compatible with access from multiple computers since it
   tends to sprinkle messages across all of the computers used for mail
   access. Thus, unless all of those machines share a common file system,
   the offline mode of access that POP was designed to support
</blockquote>
<P>
	There is *much* more info at this site -- I only clipped
	the first two paragraphs.
<P>
	Some related work is the ACAP (Application Configuration 
	Access Protocol) and the IMSP (Internet Message Support 
	Protocol) which are other drafts that are currently on 
	the table at the IETF (www.ietf.org).
<P>
	To quote another site that came up in my search:
<blockquote> 
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/acap/">
   ACAP</A> is a solution for the problem of client mobility on the 
   internet. Almost all Internet applications currently store 
   user preferences, options, server locations, and other 
   personal data in local disk files. These leads to the 
   unpleasant problems of users having to recreate configuration 
   set-ups, subscription lists, addressbooks, bookmark files, 
   folder storage locations, and so forth every time they change 
   physical locations.
</blockquote> 
<P>
	If you're getting confused -- don't worry -- we all
	are.  I've been bumping into references to IMAP, and
	ACAP for a few months now.  They are pretty new and 
	intended to address issues that only recently grew 
	up to be problems for enough people to notice them.
<P>
	The short form is:  IMAP is an advanced protocol for 
	accessing individual headers and messages from a remote
	mail box.  ACAP (which I guess replaces or is built over
	IMSP) provides access to more advanced configuration
	options to affect how IMAP (and potentially other 
	remotely accessed applications) behave for a given account.
<P> <B> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
1) Is there any IMAP to Linux, esp. Red Hat ?
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	There is an IMAP server included with Linux some
	Linux distributions (Red Hat 3.03 or later I suspect).
	I'm not sure about the feature set -- and the 
	man page on my Red Hat 3 system here is pretty sparse.
<P>
	However the server is not the real problem here.
	What you really need is a client program that can
	talk to your IMAP server.
<P> <B> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
2) Where can I get it ?
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	The CMU (Carnegie-Mellon University) Cyrus IMAP project
	looks promising  -- so I downloaded a copy of that
	as I typed this and looked up some of these other references.
<P>
	It's about 400K and can be found somewhere at:
<P>
		ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/
<P> <B> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
3) What must I be carefully when I install it ?
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	You must have a client that supports the IMAP features 
	that you're actually looking for.  It's possible to 
	have a client that treats an IMAP server just like a 
	POP3 server (fetchmail for example). It may be that
	Netscape's UIDL support is all you need for your
	purposes.
<P>
	I didn't find any reference to IMAP anywhere on
	Netscape's site -- which suggests that they don't 
	offer it yet.  I'm blind copying a friend of mine
	that is a programmer for them -- and specifically
	one who worked (works?) on the code for the mail
	support in the Navigator.  Maybe he'll tell me 
	something about this (or maybe it's covered by his
	NDA).
<P>
	I also looked at Eudora and Pegasus web pages and
	found no IMAP support for these either.  It was a 
	long shot since neither of these has a Linux port
	(so far as I know) -- and I doubt you want to run
	WABI to read all of your mail -- nor even DOSEmu
	to run the Pegasus for DOS.
<P>
	pine seems to support IMAP.  XF-Mail (a popular
	free X mail user agent) and Z-Mail (a popular
	commercial one) also seem to have some support.
	More info on IMAP clients is available at the 
	IMAP Info Center (see below).

Mail & Sendmail 
</h3>
<P> <B>
From: Franaur P. Tan, <A HREF="mailto:noy@ayala.com.ph">noy@ayala.com.ph
</A>
</B> <P><B>  
Hi There, <BR> 
I just read your article on Linux Gazette, got a lot of
good tips on securing my Linuz machine, thanks.  Like
always, I have one bit of question I was hoping you could
answer, I'd like to send mail from my Linux machine w/o
installing sendmail, and I need this e-mail to be sent
by a script initiated by crond.
</B> <P><B>  
Right now (w/ sendmail installed) I can do it with
a "mail -s subject noy@ayala.com.ph < my_message".
I'd really like to remove sendmail from my system.
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	Which article?  I'm trying to submit at least
	one a month.
<P>
	Well, you can use smail or qmail.  These are
	replacements for sendmail.  
<P>
	I haven't installed either of these but I've 
	fetched a copy of qmail and read a bit of the 
	documentation.  I might be implementing a 
	system with that pretty soon.
<P>
	However I'm not sure how much you gain this
	way.  It's possible to configure 'sendmail'
	to send only so that it doesn't listen to 
	incoming mail at all.  This is most easily
	done by simply changing the line in your 
	rc files that invokes sendmail (that would be
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail.init on a typical
	Red Hat or Caldera system).  Just take the 
	"-bd" off of that line like so:
<PRE> 
		/usr/lib/sendmail -bd -q1h
</PRE> 
	... would become:
<PRE> 
		/usr/lib/sendmail -q1h
</PRE> 
	... or
<PRE> 
		/usr/lib/sendmail -q15m
</PRE> 
		(changing the queue processing frequency 
		from every hour to every 15 minutes).
<P>
	You can also remove sendmail from memory entirely
	and use a cronjob to invoke it like:
<PRE> 
	00,30 * * * * root /usr/lib/sendmail -q
</PRE> 
		(to process the queue on the hour and at
		 half past every hour).
<P>
	If you concerns are about remote attacks through 
	your smtpd service than any of these methods will
	be sufficient.  
<P>
	You should also double check your /etc/inetd.conf for 
	the smtp service line.  This is normally commented out 
	since most hosts default to loading a sendmail daemon.  
	It should stay that way.
<P>
	If you are using fetchmail (and getting your 
	mail via POP or IMAP) you either after to load
	some sort of smtp listener (such as sendmail,
	smail, or qmail) or you have to over-ride 
	fetchmail's defaults with some command line
	options.
<P>
	'fetchmail' defaults to a mode whereby it 
	connects to the remote POP or IMAP server,
	and to the localhost's smtpd and relays the 
	mail from one through the other.  This allows
	for any aliases, .forwards, and procmail processing
	to work properly on the local system and it 
	allows fetchmail to benefit from sendmail's 
	queue handling (to make sure you have sufficient
	disk space etc).
<P>
	However you can configure sendmail to run out 
	of in inetd.conf with TCP Wrappers (the tcpd entry that 
	appears on almost all of the other services in that file) 
	and limit the listener to only accept connections from 
	the local host.
<P>
	You'd then configure your /etc/hosts.deny file
	to look something like:
<PRE>
		ALL:ALL
</PRE> 
	... spr  (default to not letting anyone access any
	local services) -- and you'd put something like:
<PRE> 
		ALL: localhost
		in.telnetd: LOCAL
		in.ftpd: LOCAL
</PRE> 		
	... etc. in your /etc/hosts.allow
<P>
	Finally you'd add something like:
<PRE> 
smtp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/sendmail -bs 
</PRE> 
	... to your /etc/inetd.conf.  
<P>
	(the -bs switch tells sendmail to "be" an "smtp"
	 handler for one transaction.  It handles one 
	 connection on stdin/stdout and exits).
<P>
	 All of this discussion assumes that you want to
	 be able to use local mailers (like elm, and mailx)
	 to send your mail and fetchmail to fetch it 
	 from a POP or IMAP server.
<P>
	If your client is capable of it (like the 
	mail reader in Netscape) you could configure
	it to use a remote smtpd gateway directly
	(it would make the connection to the remote
	host's smtp port and let it relay the mail from
	there).  Then you'd have no sendmail, qmail, or
	smail anywhere on the system.
<P>
	pine might be able to send directly via smtp
	(it does have an IMAP client so this would be a
	logical complement to that).
<P>
	I hope all of this discussion gives you some ideas.
	As you can see there are lots of options.

	I think this answer was a waste of bandwidth.
	Perhaps Andries didn't know this -- or perhaps he
	tried and the man page didn't make any sense.
<P>
	In either event it doesn't do a thing for any of us 
	(that didn't know the answer) and is an obvious and
	public slap in the face.
<P>
	You could have at least added:
<P>
		'look for gid= and umask= under options'
<P>
	Me, I don't know these well enough so let me 
	switch over to another VC, pull up the man page myself,
	and play with that a bit...
<PRE> 	
	mount -t msdos -ogid=10,umask=007 /dev/hda1  /mnt/c
</PRE> 
	This command mounts a file system of type msdos (-t)
	with options (-o) that specify that all files are to 
	be treated as being owned by gid 10 ('wheel' on my system)
	and that they should be have an effective umask of 007
	(allowing members of group 'wheel' to read, write and 
	execute anywhere on the partition.  My C: drive is 
	/dev/hda1 and I usually mount it under /mnt/c.
<P>
	I tried specifying the gid by name -- no go.  You have to 
	look up the numeric in the /etc/group file.  I tried
	different ownership and permissions on the underlying 
	directory -- they are ignored.
<P>
	This set of parameters does seem to work with vfat and
	umsdos mountings.  Using the msdos or vfat at the time
	means that chmod and chown/chgrp commands dont' work
	on that fs.  Using the -t umsdos allow me to change the 
	ownership and permissions -- and the changes seem to be
	effective.  However there are some oddities in what happens
	when you umount and remount the drive (the move of the 
	write permission on files seems to stick but the ownership
	changes are lost and the owner/group r-x bits seem to 
	"come back."
<P>
	Obviously I haven't done much testing with this sort of 
	thing.  I usually don't write to my DOS partitions 
	from in Linux.  In fact I haven't see my DOS hard drive
	partition on this system in months (ever since I started
	compiling the msdos, vfat, and umsdos filesystems as 
	modules -- so I don't  automount them).
<P>
	I hope that helps.
<P>
	Personally I wish that the mount command would take some
	hints from the permissions of the directory that I'm 
	mounting onto.  I'm copying you two on this in the hopes
	that you'll share your thoughts on this idea.
<P>
	What if the default for mount was to set the gid and umask
	of an msdos/vfat directory based on the ownership and 
	permissions of the mount point.  In other words I set up
	/mnt/c to look like:
<PRE> 
drwxrwx---   2 root     wheel        1024 Aug  5  1996 c
</PRE> 
	(which I have) and mount would look up the gid for 
	wheel and use that and the umask for the mount options.
<P>
	This strikes me as being a reasonably intuitive behaviour.
<P>
	If it can't be the default how about an option like:
<PRE> 
		-o usemountperms
</PRE> 
	... (that particular example seems a little ugly -- but
	fairly self-explanatory).

Re: Answer Guy - POP3 Email 
</h3>
<B> 
From: Brent Austin, <A HREF="mailto:baustin@iamerica.net">
baustin@iamerica.net </A> 
</B> <P><B>  
In reading your answer in LG#14 on "Dealing with e-mail on a pop3 server",
I have almost the same challenge.  I have an ISP that is providing a 25
user POP3 Virtual Mail Server for 25 users.  The problem is that each user
must connect with the ISP individually and then to the mail server.
I would like to find some method to allow Linux to connect with the Mail
Server, individually poll each users account, and then transfer it into a
POP3 server
on the local network (possibly on the Linux box itself).  Any suggestions??
</B>
<P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	If I understand you correctly you have a LAN at your 
	place with about 25 users/accounts on it.
	You're provider has set up 25 separate POP3 mailboxes.
<P> 
	You'd like to set up your Linux (or other Unix) box to
	fetch the contents of all of these accounts (perhaps via
	a cron job) and to have it process your outgoing mail queue.
<P> 
	Then your users would fetch their mail from the Linux
	box (using their own Linux user agents or perhaps using
	Pegasus or Eudora under Windows or from Macs.
<P> 
	This is relatively straightforward (especially the POP3 
	part).
<P> 
	First get a copy of 'fetchmail' (I'm using 2.5 from 
	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu).  Build that.
<P> 
	Now, for each user, configure fetchmail using a 
	.fetchmailrc file in their home directory
<P> 
	Each will have a line that looks like:
<PRE> 
poll $HOST.YOURISP.COM proto pop3 user $HISACCT password $HISPASS
</PRE> 
	The parts of the form $ALLCAPS you replace with 
	the name of the pop server, the account holder's name
	and the account holder's password.  (I presume that  you,
	as the admin for this Unix box, are already entrusted
	with the passwords for these e-mail accounts -- since
	the admin of any Unix box can read any of the mail flowing
	through it anyway).
<P> 
	Now set up a script run as root that does something like:
<PRE> 

	##! do mail psuedo-code
	pppup (some script that brings up your PPP link)
	for users in $USERLIST do;
		[ -e ~$user/.fetchmailrc] && \
			su -c $user /usr/local/bin/fetchmail
		done;
	/usr/lib/sendmail -q		
	pppdown
</PRE> 
	You can add a section of code that graps the list
	of users from your /etc/group file (if you're writing 
	this in perl use the getgrent function (to get group
	entries) or you can use something like:
<PRE> 
	
	awk -F":" '/'$GROUPNAME\
		'/ {split($4,users, ","); 
		for (a in users) {print users[a]}; exit}' /etc/group
</PRE> 
	To get the list of users in a form suitable for 
	use in your 'for' loop.
<P> 
	Naturally my psuedo-code is closer to bash' syntax.
<P> 
	This script  (the psuedo-code one) will just bring the 
	ppplink up, for each user in the list (perhaps from a 
	group named "popusers") it will check for a .fetchmailrc
	file in their home directory and run fetchmail for those
	that have one.  It will then call sendmail to process your
	outgoing queue and bring the ppplink down.
<P> 
		(Note: the su -c ... part of this is not
		secure and there are probably some exploits
		that could be perpetrated by anyone with 
		write access to any of those .fetchmailrc's.
		However it's probably reasonably robust
		-- and you could set these files to be 
		immutable (chattr +i) and you can write
		a more secure SUID perl script to actually
		execute fetchmail.  My scripts, pppup and 
		pppdown are SUID perl scripts.
<P> 
	I haven't written this as real code and tested it since
	I don't have a need of it myself.  I recommend that 
	disconnected networks avoid using POP/SMTP for their 
	mail feed.  UUCP has been solving the  problems of 
	dialup mail delivery for 25 years and doesn't involve some 
	of the overhead and kludges necessary to do SMTP for 
	intermittently connected systems.
<P> 
	I do recommend POP/SMTP within the organization and 
	and it's absolutely necessary for the providers.
<P> 
	Anyway -- fetchmail will then have put each user's
	mail into his or here local spool file (and processed
	it through any procmail scripts that they might have 
	set up).
<P> 
	Now each of your users can use any method they prefer
	(or that you dictate) to access their mail.  DOS/Windows
	and Mac users can use Pegasus or Eudora, Linux or other
	Unix users can use fetchmail (or any of several other
	popclient, getpop, etc, other programs) to get the
	messages delivered to their workstation, or anyone in
	the organization can use telnet into the mailhost and
	user elm, pine, the old UCB mail, the RAND MH system
	or whatever.
<P> 
	All of these clients point their POP and mail clients
	to your mailhost.  Your host then acts as their spool.
	This is likely to result in fewer calls to your ISP and
	more efficient mail handling all around.
<P> 
	You may want to ask your ISP -- or look around -- for 
	UUCP providers.  On of the big benefits to this is that
	you gain complete control of mail addressing within your
	domain.  Typical UUCP rates go for about $50/mo for a 
	low volume account and about $100/mo for anything over
	100Mb per month.  However it's still possible to find
	bargains.
<P> 
	(Another nice thing about UUCP is that you can choose
	specific sites, with which you exchange a lot of mail,
	and configure your mail to be exchanged directly with
	them -- if they have the technical know-how at their
	end or are willing to let you do it for them.  This 
	can be done via direct dialup or over TCP connections).
<P> 
	uu.net is the Cadillac of UUCP providers (which is 
	a bit pricey for me -- I use a small local provider
	who gives me a suite of UUCP, PPP, shell, virtual hosting,
	virtual ftp, and other services -- and is of little
	interest to you unless you're in the Bay Area).
<P> 
	You can also find information on Yahoo! using
	a search for "uucp providers" (duh!).  I also 
	seem to recall that win.net used to provide 
	reasonable UUCP (and other) services.
<P> 
	Hope this helps.  If you need more specific help in 
	writing these scripts you may want to consider paying
	a consultant.  It should be less than three hours work
	for anyone whose qualified to do it (and not including
	the configuration of all your local clients).

Pseudo Terminal Device Questions

From: Jeong Sung Won
<P> <B> 
Hello ?<BR> 
My name is Jeong Sung Won. May I ask you a question ?
I'll make a program that uses PSEUDO TERMINAL DEVICE.
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	No need to shout -- I've heard of them.  They're
	commonly called pty's -- used by 'telnetd', 'expect', 
	'typescript', and emacs' 'M-x shell' command -- among 
	others.
<P><B>  
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
But linux has 8 bit MINOR NUMBER, so that total number of
pseudo terminal device DOESN'T OVERCOME 256.
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	That does seem to be true -- but it is a rather
	obscure detail about he kernel's internals.
<P> 
	Linus' work on the 64-bit Alpha port may change
	this.
<P><B>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
Is there any possible way to OVERCOME THIS LIMITS ?
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	Only two that I can think of.  Both would 
	involve patching the kernel.
<P> 
	You might be able to instantiate multiple
	major devices -- which implement that same
	semantics as major device number 4 (the 
	current driver for the virtual consoles and 
	all of the pty's).
<P> 
	I'm frankly not enough of a kernel hacker to tell 
	you how to do this or what sorts of problems it would
	raise.
<P> 
	The other would involve a major overhaul of the
	kernel code and all the code that depends on it.
<P><B>  
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
For example,on HP9000, minor number is 24 bit, 
and actually I used concurrently 800
pseudo terminal device. And more than 1000 is also possible.
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	I wonder what it is on RS/6000, DEC OSF/1, and Sun/Solaris.
<P> <B> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
On Linux, is it impossible to make it, let me know the way I counld tell
LINUS that upgrade minor number scheme from 8-bit to 16-bit or more-bit 
is needed.
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	Linus Torvald's e-mail address has been included with
	every copy of the sources ever distributed.  
<P> 
	However it is much better to post a message to the 
	comp.os.linux.development.system newsgroup than 
	directly to him (or any of other developer).
<P> 
	As for "telling LINUS [to] upgrade" -- while it would 
	probably be reasonably well recieved as a suggestion --
	I'm not sure that "telling" him what to do is appropriate.
<P> 
	It's easy to forget that Linus has done all of his work
	on the Linux kernel for free.  I'm not sure but I 
	imagine that the work he puts in just dealing with all the
	people involved with Linux is more time consuming and
	difficult than the actual coding.
<P> 
	As many of the people who are active in the Linux community
	are aware Linus has been very busy recently.  He's accepted
	a position with a small startup and will be moving
	to the San Francisco Bay Area (Silicon Valley, actually) 
	-- and he and Tove have just had a baby girl.  
<P> 
	I will personally understand if these events keep him 
	from being as active with Linux as he as been for the

root login Bug in Linux
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Shevek, <A HREF="mailto:ma6ybm@bath.ac.uk">ma6ybm@bath.ac.uk </A> 
</B> <P><B>  
Has anybody else found a root login bug evident on my system.
</B> <P><B>  
The root password is an 8 character random series. For going live online 
I updated the root password to a 16 character random series. I can log in 
with the 16 character series, but also using the first eight and any 
random characters after that, or just the first eight. This creates an 
infinite number of root passwords and worries me more than a little.
</B> <P> 
About Unix Passwords and Security
<P>
	This is a documented and well known limitation of 
	conventional Unix login and authentication.
<P>
	You can overcome this limit if you upgrade to the 
	shadow password suite (replace all authenticating
	programs with the corresponding shadow equivalents)
	and enable the MD5 option (as opposed to the traditional
	DES hash).
<P>
	Note -- there is probably an "infinite" number of valid
	passwords to either of these schemes.  The password
	entry on your system is not encrypted.  That is a 
	common misconception.  What is stored on your system
	is a "hash" (a complex sort of checksum).  
<P>
	Specifically the traditional Unix DES hash uses your password as
	the key to encrypt a string of nulls.  DES is a one-way algorithm
	-- so there is no known *efficient* way to reclaim the key even
	if one has copies of the plaintext and the ciphertext.
<P>
	'Crack' and it's brethren find passwords by trying dictionaries
	of words and common word variations (reverse, replace certain
	letters with visually similar numerics, various abbreviations,
	prepending/appending one or two digits, etc) -- and using the
	crypt() function (or an equivalent) on a string of nul's to find
	matches.  This isn't particularly "efficient" -- but it is several
	orders of magnitude better than an exhaustive brute force attack.
<P>
	The only two defenses against 'Crack' are:  
<ol>
<li>		Don't let anyone have copies of the password hashes
		(which is why the shadow suite puts those in a separate
		file -- that is only readable by SUID or SGID programs,
		and not normal users)
<li>		Don't allow users to use words, names, or simple
		variations of words as their passwords.  This is don't
		by installing npasswd or passwd+ (replacements for the
		stock passwd program).
</ol>
	Use both of these strategies on all mult-user systems.
	That way, if someone exploits some newly discovered 
	bug to get a copy of the shadow file, he is less likely
	to get any good passwords (since that will entail a
	password that is more clever than your npasswd rules and
	less clever than your attackers custom 'crack' dictionaries).
<P>
	It is possible that two different passwords (keys) will
	result in the same hashed value (I don't know if there are
	any examples with DES 56 bit within the domain of all
	ASCII sequence  up to eight characters -- but it is possible).
<P>
	Using MD5 allows you to have passwords as long as you like.
	Again -- it is possible (quite likely, in fact) that a
	number of different inputs will hash to the same value.
	Probably you would be looking at strings of incomprehensible
	ASCII that were several thousand bytes long before you found
	any collisions.  
<P>
	Considering that the best supercomputers and parallel
	computer clusters that are even suspected to exist take
	days or weeks to exhaustively brute force a single DES
	hash (with a max of only 8 characters and only a 56-bit
	key) -- it is unlikely that anyone will manage to find 
	one of the "other" valid keys for any well chosen password
	without expending far more energy and computing time than
	most of our systems are worth.  (Even in these days of 
	cheap PC's -- computer time is a commodity with a 
	pricetag).
<P>
	There other ways to get long password support on your 
	system.  However the only reasonable one is to use the shadow
	suite compiled with the MD5 option.  This is the way that
	FreeBSD (and it's derivatives) are installed by default --
	so the code and systems have been reasonably well tested.
<P>
	In fact -- if security and robustness are more important
	to you than other features you may want to consider
	FreeBSD or (or NetBSD, or OpenBSD) as an alternative.
	These are freely distributed Unix implementations which 
	have been around as long as Linux.  Obviously they have a 
	much smaller user base.  However each has a tightly knit
	group of developers and a devoted following which provides
	or an extremely robust and well-tested system.
<P>
	As much as I like Linux -- I often recommend FreeBSD for
	dedicated web and ftp servers.  Linux is better suited to
	the desktop and to use with exotic hardware -- or in 
	situations where the machine needs to interact with
	Netware, NT and other types of systems.  
		[Oh, Oh!  Here come the fireballs!]
<P>
	FreeBSD has a much more conservative set of features 
	(no gpm support for one example -- IP packet filtering 
	is a separate package in FreeBSD while it's built into 
	the Linux kernel).
<P>
	Another consideration is the local expertise.
	Linux and FreeBSD are both extremely similar in most
	respects (as they both are to most other Unix 
	implementations).  In some ways they are more similar
	to one another than either is to any non-PC Unix.
	However the little administrative difference might 
	very well drive your sysadmin crazy.  Particularly if 
	he has a bunch of Linux machines and is used to them --
	and you specify one or two FreeBSD systems for 
	your "DMZ" (Internet exposed LAN segment).
<P>
	Back to your original question:
<P>
	You said that you are using a "random" string of characters
	for your password.  In terms of cryptography and security
	you should be quite careful of that word: "random"
<P>
	Several cryptographically strong systems have been 
	compromised over the years by attacking the randomizer
	that were used to generate keys.  A perfect example of
	this is the hack of SSL by a student in France (which 
	was published last spring).   He cracked a Netscape
	challenge and got a prize from them for the work
	(and Netscape implemented a better random seed generation
	algorithm).
<P>
	In the context of creating "strong" passwords (ones
	that won't be tested by the best crack dictionaries out
	there) you don't need to go completely overboard.  
	However -- if a specific attacker knows a little bit
	about how you generate your random keys -- he or she
	can generate a special dictionary tailored for that 
	method.

Kernel linux 2.0.20
System P90, 8Mb, IDE, SCSI (not working fully), cd, sound, etc.
root hda2, about 20 user entries in passwd.
</B> <P><B>  
Next bug:
Two users with consecutive login entries. Both simply information logins, 
never to be logged in to, just for fingering to for status information. 
If you finger the second, OK. But if you finger the first, it fingers 
both. UID numbers 25 and 26. If I comment 26, but have a third login on 
UID 27 then it is OK. I have tried unassigning the groups and reassigning 
them. They both have real home directories, shell is dev/null, and are in 
a group called 'private' on their own. There are no groups by the same 
name as the login.
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	This sounds very odd.  I would want to look at the 
	exact passwd entries (less the password hashes) and to 
	know alot about the specific implementation of 'finger'
	that you were using (is it the GNU cfingerd?).
<P>
	I would suggest that you look at the GNU cfingerd.
	I think it's possible to configure it to do respond
	to "virtual" finger requests (i.e. you can configure
	cfingerd to respond to specific finger requests by 
	return specific files and program outputs without
	having any such accounts on your system).  This is 
	probably safer and easier than having a couple of 
	non-user psuedo accounts and using the traditional
	finger daemon.  (In additional the older fingerd is
	notoriously insecure and overflows of it was one 
	of the exploits used by the "Morris Internet Worm" 
	almost a decade ago).
<P>
	Given the concerns I would seriously consider 
	running a finger daemon in a chroot'd jail.
	Personally I disable this and most other services
	in the /etc/inetd.conf when ever I set up a new system.
<P>
	When I perform RASA (risk assessment and security auditing)
	/etc/inetd.conf is the second file I look at (after looking
	for a /etc/README file -- which no one but me ever keeps; and
	inspecting the /etc/passwd file).

and Installing Sendmail-8.8.4 (or 8.8.5).  I downloaded the 8.8.4 source
from sunsite and set it up in the /usr/src directory and using the O'Reilly
"Sendmail" book as my guide, I modified the Makefile.Linux for no DNS
support by setting ENVDEF = -DNAMED_BIND=0. And removing Berkeley DB support
(removing -DNEWDB).
After compiling and executing ./sendmail -d0.1 -bt < /dev/null in the obj
dir, I receive the following:
</B> <PRE><B>  
Version 8.8.4
 Compiled with: LOG MATCHGECOS MIME7TO8 MIME8TO7 NDBM NETINET NETUNIX
		QUEUE SCANF SMTP XDEBUG
</B> </PRE> <B> 
and the program hangs at this point.
I am running Linux.2.0.29 on a 486DX40 with 8 megs.  My gcc is version 2.7.0.
</B> <P><B>  
Any hints you could provide are greatly appreciated!,
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	I fetched a copy of 8.8.5 and used the .../src/makesendmail
	script -- and only encountered the problems with NEWDB
	Removing that seemed to work just fine.
<P>
	I noticed you said -- .../src/obj -- did you mean something
	like: .../src/obj/obj.Linux.2.0.27.i386/
<P>
	If you properly used the makesendmail script then the
	resulting .o and binaries should have landed in a directory
	such as that.
<P>
	Other than that I don't know.
<P>
	I don't disable the DNS stuff -- despite the fact that
	my sendmail almost all done via uucp.  
<P>
	As for using this with fetchmail -- I have my sendmail
	configured in /etc/inetd.conf like so:
<PRE> 
# do not uncomment smtp unless you *really* know what you are doing.
# smtp is handled by the sendmail daemon now, not smtpd.  It does NOT
# run from here, it is started at boot time from /etc/rc.d/rc#.d.
## jtd:  But I *really do* know what I'm doing.
## jtd: I want fetchmail to handle mail transparently and I
## jtd want tcpd to enforce the local only restriction
smtp    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/local\
		/sbin/sendmail -bs
</PRE> 
	(note -- the line back is for this mail only -- remove it
	before attempting to use this line.  Also note the -bs
	"be an smtp handler on stdin/stdout")
<P>
	This arrangement allows me to fetchmail, lets fetchmail
	transparently talk to sendmail, and keeps the rest of the
	world from testing their latest remote sendmail exploit
	on me while my ppp link is up (I wouldn't recommend this
	for high volume mail server!).
<P>
	Naturally I also have a cron job like this:
<PRE> 
## Call sendmail -q every half hour
00,30 * * * * root /usr/lib/sendmail -q
</PRE> 
	(which processes any mail that elm, pine, mh-e
	or any other mailers have left in the local queue --
	awaiting their trip through uucp's rmail out to the
	rest of the world).
<P>
	If you continue to have trouble compiling sendmail
	then you may want to just rely on the RPM updates.
	Compiling it can be tricky, so I avoid doing it 
	unless I see a bugtraq or CERT advisory with the
	phrase "remotely exploitable" in it.
<P>
	Re: O'Reilly's "bat" book.  Do you have the 2nd Edition?
	If not -- get it (and ask them about their "upgrade"
	pricing/discount if that's still available)
<P>

wu-ftpd Problems
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Ed Stone, <A HREF="mailto:estone@synernet.com">estone@synernet.com </A>
</B> <P><B>  
On BSDI, I've read ALL of the doc for wu-ftpd, and have ftp logins
limited to the chroot dir, but still have these problems:
1) I cannot force ftp only. The guestgroup "guests" can telnet, and go
everywhere. I've put /bin/true in /etc/shells; I've edited passwd and
master.passwd for that; no effect
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	Usually I set their passwd to /bin/false or /usr/bin/passwd.
	I make sure that I use the path filter alias to prevent
	uploads of .rhosts and .forward files into their 
	home directory under the chroot and I put entries like:
<PRE> 
		/home/.ftp/./home/fred
</PRE> 
	... for their home directory field in the (true-root)/etc/passwd
	file.
<P>
	Also make sure that you have the -a switch on the ftpd 
	(or in.ftpd) line in your inetd.conf.  The -a tells ftpd to
	use the /etc/ftpaccess file (or /usr/local/etc/ftpaccess --
	depending on how you compiled it).
<P>
	Personally I also configure each "ftponly" account into
	the sendmail aliases file -- to insure that mail gets
	properly bounced.  I either set it to the user's "real"
	e-mail address (anywhere *off* of that machine) or I set it
	to point at nobody's procmail script (which autoresponds to
	it).
<P> <B> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
2) "guests" ftp to the proper directory, but get no listing. I have set
up executable of ls in the ftp chroot dir in /bin there; no effect.
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	How do you know that they are in the proper directory?
	What happens if you use a chroot (8) command to go to 
	that dir and try it?  Is this 'ls' statically linked?
	Do you have a /dev/zero set up under your (chroot)/?
<P>
	Most common cause of this situation is a incomplete 
	(chroot) environment -- usually missing libraries or 
	missing device nodes.
<P>

<H2>CLUELESS at the Prompt: A Column for New Users</H2>
<H4>By Mike List,
<a href="mailto:troll@net-link.net">troll@net-link.net</A> </H4> 
</center>
<P> <HR> <P>  

<center><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC = "../gx/list/gnub.jpg" ></center><p>
Welcome to installment 2 of Clueless at the Prompt: 
a new column for new linux users.
On advice from several respondents, I'm going to start
using a new format for specifying commands:</p>
<pre>
    Typing them on a separate line
    separated from the text by a space
</pre>
<p>
Hopefully, this will minimize any confusion by even
the very inexperienced user as to what should be
typed at the prompt.
</p> <p>
Last time we explored some of the differences and 
similarities between linux and DOS/Windows, and I'm
going to continue this time with some stuff you 
already know, but perhaps aren't fully aware of.
</p> <p>
One respondent seemed to take exception to my DOS-linux
comparison, reminding me of the features that make
linux and unices(unix like systems) more powerful than
DOS.
</p> <p>
Fair enough, this is a new users column and I would
like to make sure that I'm not assuming that everyone
who reads this column can read my mind. Besides, if I
endure the slings and arrows of outrageous gurus I can 
hopefully expand my knowledge base, which I can then 
use for future columns. 
</p> <p>
Still, the paradigm of SUPERDOS holds some water.It is, 
after all a command line operating system which 
supports a windowing system, which has all the 
capabilities of MS Windows plus a few features that make
Windowslook pale.
</p> <p>
When you installed linux from whatever distribution,most
of the packages installed came as pre-compiled binaries
that were for the most part usable as is.
However, if you found any applications that didn't  come
with the distribution they'll probably need to be unpacked
and installed or compiled or both. 
</p> <p>
You could use a utility like installpkg, pkgtool, or dopkg
but unless the package is from the distribution, the utility 
will likely install it to the / (base ) directory, which is
probably less than optimal.
 </p> <p>      
Instead, use the midnight commander, which is a Norton
Commander clone, to view the contents of the package. 
To do this find the file,( I don't have a CD-ROM so I'm not
sure of the procedure there )locate the file, probably with
.tgz or .tar.gz extension, and highlight the file, then
hit enter. you will see the contents of the archive. 
Read the files called for instance, INSTALL, README,
Readme.whatever, or any file whose name suggests that it 
has necessary information, for a clue as to where best to
unpack it. For instance, X apps probably should be unpacked 
in the /usr/X11R6 directory.
To unpack the archive:
</p> <pre>
     cd /thechosendirectory
</pre><p> 
then:
 </p> <pre>
     tar -zxvf /wherethearchiveis/file
</pre> <p> 
you will see a list of files as they unpack. When this process is done,
you will be returned to your shell prompt. If you get any error messages
they should be pretty self explanatory, for instance a message saying file
not found means you didn't name the file correctly in the tar command,
unexpected EOF means the file was very likely corrupted or download was
incomplete, try to get the file one more time.
 </p> <p> 
At your shell prompt type:
 </p> <pre>
    ls
</pre> <p> 
to see a list of files and directories that were untarred. then:
 </p> <pre>
    less /anyfilenamelike INSTALL,README,Readme.*(*= unx, elf, lnx, etc)
</pre> <p>
It wouldn't hurt to check any license, or Copying files for info on
propers to the authors.
It also might be a good idea to print out the files if they are long or
contain a lot of special instructions so you can read and reread them
to minimize the possibility that you will have to recompile or reinstall.
If you aren't familiar with linux printing you can just:
 </p> <pre>
    cat /filename>/dev/lp0 (or lp1, or wherever your printer is located)
</pre> <p>
If you are in the directory that the file is in, you can skip the
frontslash on the filename.
If the  files include a precompiled binary, you're done except to install
if the documentation suggests a location other than where you unpacked 
and reboot or run ldconfig.
</p> <p>
If you want to examine the contents of subdirectories of your current
directory type:
 </p> <pre> 
    cd subdirectory   (leave off the / )
</pre> <p>
then,
</p> <pre> 
    ls
</pre> <p>
or,
</p> <pre>
    ls subdirectory
</pre> <p>
If you cd to a subdirectory, you can return to the top level directory by
typing:
</p> <pre> 
    cd -
</pre> <p>
If you have chosen a source file distribution of the software, then you
will need to read the file INSTALL very carefully to find what needs to be
done. Typically you might run 
</p> <pre>
    ./configure
</pre> <p>
then edit the Makefile with a text editor as described in the INSTALL or
README files, then run:
</p> <pre> 
    make 
</pre> <p>
sometimes followed by an option like linux, unx, linux-elf as instructed 
in INSTALL.When it is done compiling, the time will vary according to the
program, type:
</p> <pre>
    make install
</pre> <p>

sometimes followed by an option as above.
 </p> <p>
The above is only a general guide to steps usually needed to install
software in linux, more detailed instructions will come with the archive.
READ THEM CAREFULLY!or print out the files.
 </p> <p>
Back to the DOS-Linux comparisons. In DOS there is a method of concatenating
several files together under a batch file, which could be run to execute a
string of commands. Linux also has this capability but it is called scripting,
basically if you ever used MSEdit to create a batch file, you've done it before,
except that you must change permissions to make it executable. Type:
</p> <pre>
    chmod u+x filename  
</pre> <p>
To make sure you have executable permission,type
</p> <pre>
    ls  in the directory the file is located, usually ~ , or /home/whoever you
    are
</pre> <p>
Look for an asterisk *  after the filename which shows that it's an executable
Then you can run the string of commands by simply typing the file name of the
script you created.
 </p> <p>
Of course there's a lot more to writing scripts than this, but I'm just a GNUbee
and some things take a little time. Ihave written a couple of very simple
scripts to control the dialup to my ISP but they are very simple and rely on
recursion rather than more correct scripting so they must be killed after they
have done their jobs. An example is "on-n-on", a script I wrote to continue
dialing until I can beat the busy signal on the remote modem. It is very simply:
</p> <pre>
    ppp-on
    sleep 30
    on-n-on
</pre> <p>
The script above is called up and dials every 30 seconds until a connection is
reached, so when 30 seconds goes by without the modem dialling you will have a
connection and can open a browser or E-mail. Before that you must quit by
hitting Ctrl+C, however so that the script won't continue to use resources to do
what it has already accomplished.
 </p> <p>
I am accepting suggestions as to how this could be done more correctly, but so  
far it works for me and I have given you an idea how simple scripts can be.
</p><p>
Thanks for all the input I got from readers and surprisingly from other authors,
encouragement in the form of suggestions, none of them suggested that I go back
to m******ft.
 </p> <p>
If I had some ideas about the kind of machines Linux is going on it would be 
helpful. I'm running a relatively old 486/66 with no CD-ROM so I installed from
floppies, but most of the information here will be more about what can be done
AFTER installation.
</p> <p>
There is some discussion from from the Linux Users Support Team with regard to
the most loved, most misunderstood linux institution, man-pages. Many people,
myself included feel that they should be a little more user friendly, and some
have suggested that they be replaced witha set of documents similar to howtos>
Let me know what you think about man pages,how they could be improved, replaced
supplemented, whatever,and I can have some info next time.
</p> <p>
BTW, I made at least two errors in my DOS to Linux commands table, not very
reassuring,but the DOS command for making a directory is:
</p><pre>
    md</pre>  not<pre> mkdir</pre>
<p>
and file copy should have been:
</p><pre>
    cp /filename /to </pre>not <pre>cp /filename/filename /to
</pre><p> 
<h4> Next Time- Let me know what you would like to see in here and I'll try to
oblige just e-mail<a href="mailto:troll@net-link.net">troll@net-link.net
</a> me and ask, otherwise I'll just write about what gave me trouble and
how I got past it.</h4>

<H1>Big Brother Network Monitoring System</H1>

<H3>A Web-based Unix Network Monitoring <BR>
and Notification System</H3>

<H4>By Paul M. Sittler,
<a href="mailto:p-sittler@tamu.edu">p-sittler@tamu.edu</a></H4>

<P> <HR> <P>  

<P>Big Brother is Watching. . . </P>

<P>I wasn't bored: I don't have time to be bored. Texas
Agricultural Extension Service operates a fairly large
enterprise-wide network that stretches across hell's half acre,
otherwise known as Texas. We have around 3,000 users in 249
counties and 12 district offices who expect to get their e-mail
and files across our Wide Area Network. Some users actually
expect the network to work most of the time. We use ethernet
networking with Novell servers at some 35 locations, 15 or so
whose routers are connected via a mixture of 56Kb circuits,
fractional T1, Frame-Relay, and radio links. We are not
currently using barbed wire fences for our network, regardless
of what you may have heard. . . </P>

<P>I am privileged to be part of the team that set up that
network and tries to keep it going. We do not live in a perfect
network world. Things happen. Scarcely a day goes by when we do
not have one or more WAN link outages, usually of short
duration. We sometimes have our hands full trying to keep all
the pieces connected. Did I mention that the users expect the
mail and other software to actually work? </P>

<P>Cruising the USENET newsgroups, I read a posting about
&quot;Big Brother, a solution to the problem of Unix Systems
Monitoring&quot; written by Sean MacGuire of Montreal, Canada. I
was intrigued to notice that Big Brother was a collection of
shell scripts and simple c programs designed to monitor a bunch
of Unix machines on a network. So what if most of our mission
critical servers were Novell-based? Who cares if some of our web
servers run on Macintosh, OS/2, Win'95 or NT? We use both Linux and
various flavours of Unix in a surprisingly large number of
places. </P>

<P>We had cooked up a number of homemade monitoring systems.
Pinging and tracerouting to all the servers can be very
informative. We looked at a bunch of proprietary (and expensive)
network monitoring systems. It is amazing how much money these
things can cost.  System adminstrators often reported difficult
installations and software incompatibilities with the monitoring
software. Thus, frustrated users often gave us our first hint
that all was not well. </P>

<P>According to the blurb on Big Brother: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Big Brother is a loosely-coupled distributed set of tools for
monitoring and displaying the current status of an entire Unix
network and notifying the admin should need be. It came about as
the result of automating the day to day tasks encountered while
actively administering Unix systems.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The USENET news article provided a URL
<a href="http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/users/sean/bb-dnld/">
(&quot;http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/users/sean/bb-dnld/&quot;)</a> to
the home site of Big Brother. I pointed my browser to it and was
rewarded with a purple-sided screen background and a blue image
of a sinister face peering out under the caption &quot;big
brother is watching.&quot; After my initial shock, I learned
that Big Brother featured: </P>

<P>Big Brother is watching! As I endured the scrutiny of the
Orwellian face peering out at me, I examined the rest of the
display. The display was coded like a traffic signal
(green/yellow/red), and the update time was clearly displayed
beneath it. To the right of &quot;Big Brother&quot; were four
buttons, marked clearly &quot;Help,&quot; &quot;Info,&quot;
&quot;Page&quot; and &quot;View.&quot; Beneath the header area 
was a table with six column headings and three rows, each neatly
labelled with a computer hostname. The boxes formed by the
intersection of the rows and columns contained attractive green
and yellow balls. The overall effect was like a decorated tree.
The left side of the screen had a yellow tint, gradually
becoming black at the center.</P>

<P>I selected the &quot;Help&quot; button and was rewarded with
a brief explanation of what Big Brother was all about. Choosing
the &quot;Info&quot; Button provided a much longer and more
detailed explanation of the system, including a graphic that
really was worth a thousand words. I tried the &quot;Page&quot;
button to discover that this was a way to send a signal to a
radio-linked pager. Not at all what I had expected! Finally, the
&quot;View&quot; selection provided a briefer but perhaps more
useful view of the information, isolating only the systems with
problems.</P>

<P>In this case, only the &quot;iti-s01&quot; system was
displayed.  My browser cursor indicated a link as it passed over
each colored dot, so I clicked on the blinking yellow dot and
received a message that read:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;yellow Tue Feb 18 22:50:53 EST 1997 Feb 16 12:22:33
iti-s01 kernel: WARNING: / was not properly dismounted&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This puzzled me at first. How on earth could it know that? It
seems that BB (Big Brother) checks the system /var/log/messages
file periodically and alerts on any line that says either
&quot;WARNING&quot; or &quot;NOTICE.&quot;  As I am certain that
Sean MacGuire is very conscientious, I suspect that he adds that
line to his message file so that something will <I>appear</I> to be
wrong.</P>

<P>Suddenly, my screen spontaneously updated!  The update time
had changed by five minutes, and a blinking yellow dot appeared
under the column labelled &quot;procs.&quot;  I clicked on the
blinking yellow dot and was informed that the sendmail process
was not running.  This got me really interested!  Apparently, Big
Brother could monitor whether selected processes were
running!</P>

<P>I was also a little puzzled about the screen being updated on
its own.  I used my browser to view the document source and
discovered some html commands that were new to me:</P>

<PRE>
    &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;REFRESH&quot; CONTENT=&quot;120&quot;&gt;
    &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;EXPIRES&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Tue Feb 18 23:22:07 CST 1997&quot;&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The first line instructs browsers to get an update every 120
seconds. The second line tells the browser that it should get a
new copy after the expiration time and date. Very clever!</P>

<P>I returned to the graphics window and discovered that the
yellow area on the left had changed to red!  A new hostname row
appeared with a blinking red dot under the column labelled
&quot;conn.&quot; I clicked on the blinking red dot and read a
message that said:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;red Tue Feb 18 22:59:11 CST 1997 bb-network.sh: Can't
connect to router-000... (paging)&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The connection to the machine called router-000 had been
interrupted and the administrator had been paged.  Amazingly,
while in Texas, I had become aware of a network outage in
Montreal, Canada.  This really had possibilities.  Perhaps I
might someday be able to take a vacation!</P>

<H2>Big Brother Installation</H2>

<P>I was so impressed with Big Brother that I decided to try to
use it.  Sean has thoughtfully made its acquisition easy, but
requests that you fill out an on-line registration form with 
your name and e-mail address.  He would also like to know where
you heard about Big Brother.  I filled these out in early
November 1996, and received an e-mail survey form in late
December.</P>

<P>When I clicked on the link to download Big Brother, I ended
up with a file called &quot;bb-src.tgz.&quot;  I impetuously

better of the impending error of my ways and decided to download
and print the installation instructions.</P>

<P>I had no real problems following the installation
instructions.  I decided to make the $BBHOME directory
&quot;/usr/src/bb&quot;; use whatever makes sense to you.  The
automatic configuration routines are said to work for AIX,
FreeBSD, HPUX 10, Irix, Linux, NetBSD, OSF, RedHat Linux, SCO,
SCO 3/5, Solaris, SunOS4.1, and UnixWare.  I can vouch for Linux,
RedHat Linux, Solaris, and SunOS 4.1. </P>

<P>The c programs compiled without incident, and the
installation went smoothly. As always, your mileage may vary. In
less than an hour, I was looking at Big Brother's display of
coloured lights!</P>

<P>At this point, you may wish to re-examine the documentation
and information files. Personalize your installation as desired.
Above all, have fun!
</P>

<H2>Hacking</H2>

<P>I admit it.  I am a closet hacker.  I saw many things about
the stock BB distribution that I wanted to improve.  Big
Brother's modular and elegantly simple construction makes it a
joy to modify as desired.  The shell scripts are portable,
simple, well documented, and easy to understand.  The use of the
modified hosts file to determine which hosts to monitor was
gratifyingly familiar.  The &quot;bbclient&quot; script made it
extremely easy to move the required components to another
similar Unix host.  Sean has done a remarkable job in making
this package easy to install!</P>

<P>I got obsessive-compulsive about hacking BB and modified it
slightly, working from Sean MacGuire's v1.03 distribution as a
base.  I forwarded my changes to him for possible inclusion in a
later distribution.</P>


<P>Features that I added to BB proper include (code added is
<B>bold</B>):</P>

<UL>
    <LI>Links to the info files in the brief view (bb2.html). 
      That's when I <I>need</I> them the most.

<P>

    <LI>Links to html info files for each column heading and the
      column info files themselves.  These are placed in the
      html directory along with bb.html and bb2.html and have
      boring names like conn.html, cpu.html, . . . smtp.html.

<P>

    <LI>Checks to see if ftp servers, pop3 post offices, and SMTP
      Mail Transfer Agents (MTA's) are accessible
      ($BBHOME/bin/bb-network.sh).  These all simply use bbnet to
      telnet to the respective ports.  This followed Sean's
      style of adding comments to the bb-hosts file as follows:

<PRE>
128.194.44.99   behemoth.tamu.edu       # BBPAGER <B>smtp ftp pop3</B>
165.91.132.4    bryan-ctr.tamu.edu      # <B>pop3 smtp</B>
128.194.147.128 csdl.tamu.edu           # http://csdl.tamu.edu/ <B>ftp smtp</B> 
</PRE>

<P>

    <LI>I added some environment variables to $BBHOME/etc/bbdef.sh
      for the added monitoring as follows:

<PRE>
#
# WARNING AND PANIC LEVELS FOR DIFFERENT THINGS
# SEASON TO TASTE
#
DFPAGE=Y                   	# PAGE ON DISK FULL (Y/N)

export DFPAGE CPUPAGE TELNETPAGE HTTPPAGE FTPPAGE POP3PAGE SMTPPAGE
</PRE> 

<P>

    <LI>I updated the bb-info.html and bb-help.html pages to
      reflect a version of 1.03a and a date of 10 February 1997. 
      I also modified them to add brief mention of the new ftp,
      pop3, and smtp monitoring things.  Specifically, I changed
      the bb-help.html file to add new pager codes for them as
      follows:

<PRE>
100 - Disk Error.  Disk is over 95% full...
200 - CPU Error.  CPU load average is unacceptably high.
300 - Process Error.  An important process has died.
400 - Message file contains a serious error.
500 - Network error, can't connect to that IP address.
600 - Web server HTTP error - server is down.
<B>610 - Ftp server error - server is down.
620 - POP3 server error - PopMail Post Office is down.
630 - SMTP MTA error - SMTP Mail Host is down.</B>
911 - User Page. Message is phone number to call back.
</PRE>

<P>

    <LI>I added sections to the bb-info.html file to explain the
      added ftp, pop3, and smtp monitoring.  

<P>

    <LI>I use a standard tagline file on each html page that
      identifies the author and location of the page.  Thus,
      mkbb.sh and mkbb2.sh now look for an optional tagline file
      to incorporate into the html documents that they generate. 
      The optional files are named mkbb.tag (for mkbb.sh) and
      mkbb2.tag (for mkbb2.sh).  The shell scripts look for the
      optional tagline files in the $BBHOME/web directory (which
      is where the mkbb.sh and mkbb2.sh files reside).

<P>

    <LI>I went through ALL of the html-generating scripts and
      html files to ensure that they actually had &lt;HEAD&gt;
      sections and properly placed double quotes around the
      various arguments.

<P>

    <LI>For the most part, I edited the files so that everything
       would fit on an 80-column screen.

<P>

    <LI> I modified $BBHOME/etc/bbsys.sh to make it easier to
       ignore certain disk volumes as follows: 

<PRE>
#
# DISK INFORMATION
#
DFSORT="4" 			# % COLUMN - 1
DFUSE="^/dev"                   # PATTERN FOR LINES TO INCLUDE
DFEXCLUDE="<B>-E dos|cdrom</B>" 	# PATTERN FOR LINES TO EXCLUDE
</PRE>

<P>

    <LI> I modified $BBHOME/etc/bbsys.linux so that the ping
       program is properly found as follows: 

<PRE>
#
# bbsys.linux
#
# BIG BROTHER
# OPERATING SYSTEM DEPENDENT THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED
#
<B>PING="/bin/ping" 		# LINUX CONNECTIVITY TEST</B>
PS="/bin/ps -ax"		# LINUX
DF="/bin/df -k"
MSGFILE="/var/adm/messages"
TOUCH="/bin/touch"		# SPECIAL TO LINUX
</PRE>

<P>

    <LI>I added the ability to dynamically traceroute and ping
       each system being monitored. I spoke with Sean about it,
       and, in keeping with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
       principle, we thought these features were best added in
       the info files. The user portion is pretty obvious in the
       source to the info file.  The cgi scripts are very simple
       shell scripts included below:

</UL>

<PRE>
# traceroute.cgi ===========================================
#!/bin/sh

TRACEROUTE=/usr/bin/traceroute

echo Content-type: text/html
echo

if [ -x $TRACEROUTE ]; then
        if [ $# = 0 ]; then
                cat &lt;&lt; EOM
&lt;TITLE&gt;TraceRoute Gateway&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;TraceRoute Gateway&lt;/H1&gt;

&lt;ISINDEX&gt;

This is a gateway to &quot;traceroute.&quot;  Type the desired hostname
(like hostname.domain.name, eg. net.tamu.edu) in your
browser's search dialog, and enter a return.&lt;P&gt;

EOM
        else
                echo \&lt;PRE\&gt;
                $TRACEROUTE $*
        fi
else
        echo Cannot find traceroute on this system.
fi
# traceroute.cgi ===========================================


# ping.cgi ===========================================
#!/bin/sh

PING=/bin/ping

echo Content-type: text/html
echo

if [ -x $PING ]; then
        if [ $# = 0 ]; then
                cat &lt;&lt; EOM
&lt;TITLE&gt;TraceRoute Gateway&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;TraceRoute Gateway&lt;/H1&gt;

&lt;ISINDEX&gt;

This is a gateway to &quot;ping.&quot; Type the desired hostname
(like hostname.domain.name, eg. &quot;net.tamu.edu&quot;) in your
browser's search dialog, and enter a return.&lt;P&gt;

EOM
        else
                echo \&lt;PRE\&gt;
                $PING -c5 $*
        fi
else
        echo Cannot find ping on this system.
fi

# ping.cgi ===========================================
</PRE>

  
<H2>Future Enhancements of Big Brother</H2>

<P>Sean MacGuire is the primary author of Big Brother.  In the
finest InterNet tradition of decentralized shared software
development, Sean solicits improvements, suggestions, and
enhancements from all.  He then skillfully incorporates them as
appropriate into the Big Brother distribution.  Thus, like
Linux, Big Brother is in a dynamic state of positive evolution
with contributions from a cast of thousands (at least dozens). 
This constrained anarchy can produce interesting results with an
international flavour.</P>

<P>Jacob Lundqvist of Sweden is actively improving the paging
interface.  He has done a superb job of enhancing the paging
portion, adding support for alphanumeric and SMS pagers. Darren
Henderson (Maine, US) added AIX support.  David Brandon (Texas,
US) added proper IRIX support, and Jeff Matson (Minnesota, US)
made some IRIX fixes.  Richard Dansereau (Canada) ported Big
Brother to SCO3 and provided support for other df's.  Doug White
(Oregon, US) made some paging script bug fixes.  Ron Nelson
(Minnesota, US) adapted BB to RedHat Linux. Jac Kersing
(Netherlands) made some security enhancements to bbd.c. Alan Cox
(Wales) suggested some shell script security modifications.
Douwe Dijkstra (Netherlands) provided SCO 5 support. Erik
Johannessen (Minnesota, US) survived SunOS 4.1.4 installation.
Curtis Olson (Minnesota, US) survived IRIX, Linux, and SunOS
installations. Gunnar Helliesen (Norway) ported Big Brother to
Ultrix, OSF, and NetBSD. Josh Wilmes (Missouri, US) added
Solaris changes for new ping stuff.</P>

<P>Many other unsung heros around the world are undoubtedly
working to enhance BB at this very moment.</P>

<P>I am (ab)using Big Brother in ways not originally envisioned
by its creator, Sean MacGuire.  Texas Agricultural Extension's
networks are wildly heterogeneous mixtures of different
operating systems and protocols, rather than a homogeneous
Unix-based network.  I would like to see Big Brother learn about
IPX/SPX protocols for Novell connectivity monitoring.  I would
also like to see Big Brother data collection modules for
Macintosh, Novell, OS/2, Windows 3.1x, Windows'95, and Windows
NT.  Rewriting Big Brother into perl might better serve these
disparate platforms.  If I could only find the time!</P>


<H2>Big Brother's Impact at Texas Agricultural Extension Service</H2>

<P>We are now monitoring around 122 hosts.  Only 20 are actually
Unix-based hosts that run Big Brother's bb program internally. 
Some 28 are Novell servers, 39 are routers, and the rest are a
mixture of Macintosh, OS/2, Windows 3.1x, Windows'95, and
Windows NT machines running one or more types of servers (34 ftp
or 26 http).  We also find it useful to monitor our 31 popmail
post offices and 43 mail hosts and gateways. We are checking
connectivity on three DNS servers as well, as they are mission
critical.</P>

<P>Big Brother (or, as I now affectionately refer to it, "Big
Bother") is now alerting us to outages five or more times daily.
Typically, the system administrator receives a page.  BB's
display is checked and the info file is used to traceroute and
ping the offending machine to validate the outage.  Many
connection outages involve routers, DSU/CSUs and multiplexors as
well as the actual host.  BB's display allows us to quickly see
a pattern that aids in diagnosis.  The ability to dynamically
traceroute and ping the host from the html info page also helps
to rapidly determine the actual point of failure.  If the
administrator paged cannot correct the problem, he relays it to
the responsible person or agency.</P>

<P>Before we installed Big Brother, we were frequently notified
of these failures by frustrated users telephoning us.  Now, we
are often aware of what has failed before they call us.  The
users are also becoming aware that they may monitor the network
through the WWW interface.  In many instances, we are able to
actually correct the problem before it perturbs our users.  It
is difficult to accurately measure the time saved, but we
estimate that Big Brother has had a net positive effect.</P>

<P>We have a machine in a publicly visible area displaying the
brief view of Big Brother.  The green, yellow, red and blue
screen splashes are clearly visible far down the hall.  This
helps our network team to be more aware of problems as they
occur.  The accessibility of the WWW page has made Big Brother
useful even to people at the far ends of our network.
So far, we are not inclined to shut Big Brother down.  It has
become a helpful member of our network team.</P>

<P>Maybe now I'll have time to be bored. . . </P>

<center><h1>Date and Its Switches</h1></center>

<center><h4><a href="mailto: layers@vax2.rainis.net">by Larry
Ayers</a></h4></center>

<P> <HR> 
<!--===================================================================-->
<p>At first glance the humble GNU utility <em>date</em> seems to be a very
minor program, perhaps useful in shell-scripts but hardly something to get
excited about.  Type "date" at the prompt, press <em>enter</em>, and
"Tue Feb 11 09:25:50 CST 1997" (or something similar) is displayed on your
screen.  As with so many unix-ish utilities, the bare command is really
just a template, waiting to be laden with switches.

<p>I keep a journal, and I've been using a header line for each entry with
this format:<br><pre>

Tue 11 Feb 1997       *** Journal Entry #44 ***       9:30 PM

</pre>

<p>Weary of typing the header each day, some time ago I began attempts to
automate it.  Creating an abbreviation or macro for the center field is not
hard with most editors, but I wanted the date and time as well.  Reading the
man page for <em>date</em> I discovered that it has numerous formatting
switches. You can make the command print out the date and/or the time in
just about any fashion you can think of.  The first field of the above
header can be created with these switches:<br>

<p><code>date '+%a %-d %b %Y'</code>

<p>while the time-of-day field uses these:<br>

<br> <code>date '+%-I:%M %p'</code>

<p>The single quotes are essential when combining several of the switches.
I tried for some time to get the command to do what I wanted without
success; while rereading the man- page I eventually noticed the quotes.  Of
course no-one is going to memorize <b>date</b>'s numerous switches, which is
probably one reason the shell script was invented.  I wrote two short
scripts; the first, called <b>mydate</b>, is just:<br><pre><code>
#!/bin/bash
date '+%a %-d %b %Y'
</code></pre>

<p>The second, called <b>mytime</b> is the similar but with the above time
switches for <b>date</b>.

<p>Typing the daily header in Emacs was now somewhat easier: first the command
<kbd>Control-u Esc-!</kbd>; when prompted in the mini-buffer I'd type
<b>mydate</b> and the formatted date would begin the line.  Next a keyboard
macro for the center "Journal Entry" field, then a command like the first to
have the time inserted at the end of the line.

<p>After performing this little keyboard ritual for a few days, it occurred to
me that perhaps an Emacs macro could have a shell command embedded within it.
Reading a few <b>Info</b> files confirmed this supposition and suggested yet
another refinement.  I learned that it's possible to cause a macro to pause
for input and then resume!  This would be just ideal for the journal entry
number.

<p>The sequence which I came up with was: <kbd>Control-(</kbd> to start
recording the macro, then <kbd>Control-u Esc-!</kbd> followed (when
prompted) by <b>mydate</b>.  At this point I typed in some spaces, then
<kbd>*** Journal Entry #</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Control-u Control-x q</kbd>
to start a recursive edit; this pauses the macro and allows the entry number
to be entered.  Next is <kbd>Esc Control-c</kbd> which exits the recursive
edit and lets the macro proceed.  The macro is completed with some more
spaces, then <kbd>control-u Esc-!</kbd>, the <b>mytime</b> shell-script
command, and ends with two <kbd>Enter</kbd> keystrokes and two spaces, to
indent the first sentence. <kbd>Control-)</kbd> stops the macro-recording.
Whew! That's a lot harder to describe than to type.

<p>This routine would be ridiculously esoteric if you had to remember
it. Luckily in Emacs you only have to do it one time.  Once you've constructed
such a macro and tried it out to see if it does what you want, two more
steps will record it in your <kbd>~/.emacs</kbd> file so that it can be
executed with a simple keystroke.

<p>The first step is to give the macro a name, which can be
anything. <kbd>Esc-x name-last-kbd-macro</kbd>, followed by
<kbd>Return</kbd>, then the name and another <kbd>Return</kbd>, sets the
name.  At this point load your <kbd>~/.emacs</kbd> file, move the cursor to
where you want the macro definition, then type <kbd>Esc-x
insert-kbd-macro</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Return</kbd>.  There you go!  As
long as you keep your <kbd>~/.emacs</kbd> file you'll have the macro
available.  Now you can type <kbd>Esc-x [macroname]</kbd> and it'll
execute.  If you've put a recursive edit in it, just remember to type
<kbd>Esc Control-c</kbd> after you've inserted the text you need and the macro
will conclude.  

<p>This may seem like a convoluted procedure, and it is, the first time you do
it: haltingly typing in a macro, starting over from scratch after one
mis-typed character, all the while frequently referring to the docs.  Then
repeating the process when it doesn't do what you wanted!

<p>The second time you will probably remember about half of the commands,
enough that it's no longer a tortuous task.  Creating and saving macros
using these techniques isn't an everyday task; I've found that I have to
refresh my memory on at least part of the procedure every time I do it, but
for repetitive editing tasks the time spent is amply repaid.

<p>If you make very many of these you risk bloating your <i>~/.emacs</i>
file, causing the editor to load even more slowly and wasting memory.
Typically these macros have a specific use, so it makes sense to keep
them in categorised LISP files, one for each type of file you edit.  Put
each file in the directory where it will be used, and load them on demand
with the command <kbd>Esc-x load-file [filename]</kbd>.

<p>So there is a reason the Emacs partisans like to call it an "extensible"
editor.  These macros are just the tip of the iceberg; over the years many
LISP extensions to Emacs have been contributed to the free software
community by programmers world-wide.  Luckily some of the best of them tend
to be incorporated into successive releases of Emacs and XEmacs; many others
are available from the
<a href="ftp://archive.cs.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive">
Emacs-Lisp Archive</a>.
Another good source for Emacs information is the
<a href="http://www.csc.uvic.ca/~jk/emacs.html">
Gnu Emacs and XEmacs Information and Links Site</a>.

<h2>1. Getting and installing Debian GNU/Linux</h2>

<p>META: I will not expand on system requirements here because this
subject is surely covered in previous chapters of this book or in
the "Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO" located at
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html"> 
http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html</a>. 


<p><b>1.1 Getting floppy images</b>
  
<p>If you have access to the Internet, the best way to get Debian is
via anonymous FTP (File Transfer Protocol). The home 
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian">ftp site of Debian</a>
is located at ftp.debian.org in /pub/debian directory. The structure
of debian archive is built as following:

<p>
<blockquote>
<table border=1 cellpadding=6>
<tr><td valign=top>./stable/        </td><td valign=top>(latest stable debian 
release)<br></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>./stable/binary-i386     </td><td valign=top>(debian packages for i386 
                                    architecture)<br></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>./stable/disks-i386        </td><td valign=top>(boot and root disks needed 
                                    for Debian installation)<br></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>./stable/disks-i386/current    </td><td valign=top>(The current boot floppy 
set)<br></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>./stable/disks-i386/special-kernels </td><td valign=top>(Special kernels and 
boot floppy
                                    disks, for hardware configurations
				    that refuse working with our regular
				    boot floppies)<br></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>./stable/msdos-i386     </td><td valign=top>(dos short file names for debian 
                                    packages)<br></td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
For base installation of Debian you will need about 12 megabytes of
disk space, and some floppies. First you will need boot and root
floppy images. Debian provides two sets of installation floppy
images, for floppy 1440 and 1200 floppy drives. Check what floppy
drive your system boots from, (it is the A: drive under Dos) and
download the appropriate disk set.

Files in ./stable/disks-i386/current: 

<p><blockquote>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td align=center><b>Filename</b> </td><td align=center> <b>Label</b> </td><td align=center> <b>Description</b>
<tr><td>rsc1440.bin </td><td> "Rescue Floppy"   </td><td rowspan=7>Floppy set for systems with 1.2MB floppy drive and at least 5MB RAM.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>drv1440.bin </td><td> "Device Drivers"  <br></td></tr>
<tr><td>base14-1.bin </td><td> "Base 1"   <br></td></tr> 
<tr><td>base14-2.bin </td><td> "Base 2"       <br></td></tr>   
<tr><td>base14-3.bin </td><td> "Base 3"           <br></td></tr>
<tr><td>base14-4.bin </td><td> "Base 4"           <br></td></tr>
<tr><td>root.bin </td><td> "Root Disk"        <br></td></tr>
<tr><td>rsc1440r.bin  </td><td> "Rescue Floppy"  </td><td>   Optional Rescue Disk image for
					low memory systems (less then 5MB
					of RAM)</td></td>

<tr><td>rsc1200r.bin  </td><td> "Rescue Floppy"    </td><td rowspan=7>Floppy set for systems with 1.44MB floppy drive
<tr><td>drv1200.bin   </td><td> "Device Drivers"   <br></td></tr>
<tr><td>base12-1.bin  </td><td> "Base 1"           <br></td></tr>  
<tr><td>base12-2.bin  </td><td> "Base 2"       	   <br></td></tr>   
<tr><td>base12-3.bin  </td><td> "Base 3"           <br></td></tr>
<tr><td>base12-4.bin  </td><td> "Base 4"           <br></td></tr>
<tr><td>root.bin      </td><td> "Root Disk"        <br></td></tr>

</table>
</blockquote>
<p>

Choose the appropriate floppy set, corresponding to your hardware
setup (Ram and floppy drive). What ever you choose, at the end you
have to have 7 floppy images which contain, "Rescue Floppy", "Device
Drivers, "Base 1", "Base 2" ..., "Root Disk". (Note, "Root Disk"
image is the same for all drives and system types.)

<p><b>1.2 Preparing the floppies</b>

<p>Next step is to prepare the floppies for the installation by copying
the images into disks. Hence those files are disk images, they
should be copied block-by-block. In Dos you can use the RAWRITE
utility for that purpose located at
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/tools/rawrite2.exe">
ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/tools/rawrite2.exe</a>. 
Here is a brief explanation on how to use it:

<pre>
C:\> RAWRITE2 <file> <drive>
</pre>
By executing the <tt>RAWRITE2</tt> command as stated above, you will
accomplish the following, the file "&lt;file&gt;" will be copied
block-by-block into the drive "&lt;drive&gt;".
<p>
On any Unix like operation systems you can use <tt>dd(1)</tt>:

<pre>
# dd if=file of=/dev/fd0 bs=10k
</pre>

META: In some Unix systems the first floppy device maybe named
differently.
<p>
When you finish rawriting don't forget to mark the floppies else you
will get confused later.
<p>
  <b>1.3 Downloading the packages</b>

<p>In order to install and use Debian you will need more then the base
system. To decide what packages you want on your system download the
file 'Packages' from
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/stable/Packages"> 
ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/stable/Packages</a>. 
This file is a list
of Debian packages available for the moment in stable Debian
distribution. This file comes in special format, evry package has
it's own entry separated by a blank line, here is an explanation of
each field in the package entry:

<p>
<blockquote>

META: More detailed explanation on Debian packaging scheme you can
find in section 2.1 of this chapter.

<p>
The above should give you an idea on how to build your personal
download list. When you have the list of packages you want to
download, you will have to decide how and when you want to download
them. If you are an experienced user you may want to download the
netbase package, and slip/ppp if needed, for later downloading from
linux. Otherwise you can download all the packages from your current
OS and install them later from mounted partition.

  
<p>
<b>1.4 Booting from floppies and installing Debian GNU/Linux</b>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Rescue Floppy</i>
<p>
<dd>Place the Rescue floppy in the a: floppy drive, and reset the system
by pressing reset, turning the system off and then on, or by
pressing Control-Alt-Del on the keyboard. The floppy disk should be
accessed, and you should then see a screen that introduces the
rescue floppy and ends with the boot: prompt. It's called the Rescue
floppy because you can use it to boot your system and perform
repairs if there is ever a problem that makes your hard disk
unbootable. Thus, you should save this floppy after you've installed
your system.
<p>
You can do two things at the boot: prompt. You can press the
function keys F1 through F10 to view a few pages of helpful
information, or you can boot the system. If you have any hardware
devices that aren't made accessible from Linux correctly when Linux
boots, you may find a parameter to add to the boot command line in
the screens you see by pressing F3, F4, and F5. If you add any
parameters to the boot command line, be sure to type the word linux
and a space before the first parameter. If you simply press Enter,
that's the same as typing linux without any special parameters.
<p>
If this is the first time you're booting the system, just press
Enter and see if it works correctly. It probably will. If not, you
can reboot later and look for any special parameters that inform the
system about your hardware.
<p>
Once you press Enter, you should see the message Loading..., and
then Uncompressing Linux..., and then a page or so of cryptic
information about the hardware in your system. There may be a many
messages in the form can't find something, or something not present,
can't initialize something, or even this driver release depends on
something. Most of these messages are harmless. You see them because
the installation boot disk is built to run on computers with many
different peripheral devices. Obviously, no one computer will have
every possible peripheral device, so the operating system may emit a
few complaints while it looks for peripherals you don't own. You may
also see the system pause for a while. This happens when it is
waiting for a device to respond, and that device is not present on
your system. If you find the time it takes to boot the system
unacceptably long, you can create a custom kernel once you've
installed your system without all of the drivers for non-existent
devices.
<p>
<dt><i>Low-Memory Systems</i>
<p>
<dd>If you system has 4MB RAM, you may now see a paragraph about low
memory and a text menu with three choices. If your system has enough
RAM you won't see this at all, and you'll go directly to the
color-or-monochrome dialog box. If you get the low-memory menu, you
should go through its selections in order. Partition your disk,
activate the swap partition, and start the graphical installation
system. The program that is used to partition your disk is called
cfdisk, and you should use the manual page for cfdisk as an aid in
its operation. Use cfdisk to create a Linux Swap partition (type
82). You need the swap partition to provide virtual memory during
the installation process, since that process will use more memory
than you have in your system. Select the size for the amount of
virtual memory you intend to use once your system is installed. 16
megabytes is probably the lowest amount that's practical, use 32
megabytes if you can spare the space, and 64 if your disk is large
enough that you won't miss that much.
<p>
<dt><i>The Color-or-Monochrome Dialog Box</i>
<p>
<dd>Once the system has finished booting, you should see the color or
monochrome choice dialog box. If your monitor displays
black-and-white, press Enter to continue with the installation.
Otherwise, use the arrow key to move the cursor to the Color menu
item and then press Enter. The display should change from
black-and-white to color. Then press Enter again to continue with
the installation.
<p>
<dt><i>The Main Menu</i>
<p>
<dd>You may see a dialog box that says The installation program is
determining the current state of your system. On some systems, this
will go by too quickly to read. You'll see this dialog box between
steps in the main menu. The installation program will check the
state of the system in between each step. This checking allows you
to re-start the installation without losing the work you have
already done if you happen to halt your system in the middle of the
installation process. If you have to restart an installation, you
will have to configure color-or-monochrome, configure your keyboard,
re-activate your swap partition, and re-mount any disks that have
been initialized. Anything else that you have done with the
installation system will be saved.
<p>
During the entire installation process, you will be presented with
the main menu. The choices at the top of the menu will change to
indicate your progress in installing the system. Phil Hughes wrote
in <i>Linux Journal</i> that you could teach a chicken to install Debian!
He meant that the installation process was mostly just pecking at
the return key. The first choice on the installation menu is the
next action that you should perform according to what the system
detects you have already done. It should say Next, and at this point
the next item should be Configure the Keyboard.
<p>
<dt><i>Configuring the Keyboard</i>
<p>
<dd>Make sure the highlight is on the Next item, and Press Enter to go
to the keyboard configuration menu. Select a keyboard that conforms
to the layout used for your national language, or select something
close if the keyboard layout you want isn't represented. Once the
system is installed, you'll be able to select a keyboard layout from
a wider range of choices. Move the highlight to the keyboard
selection you desire and press enter. Use the arrow keys to move the
highlight - they are in the same place in all national language
keyboard layouts, so they are independent of the keyboard
configuration.
<p>
<dt><i>The Shell</i>
<p>
<dd>If you are an experienced Unix or Linux user, press LeftAlt-F2 to
get to the second virtual console. That's the Alt key on the
left-hand side of the space bar, and the F2 function key, at the
same time. This is a separate window running a Bourne shell clone
called ash. At this point you are booted from the RAM disk, and
there is a limited set of Unix utilities available for your use. You
can see what programs are available with the command ls /bin /sbin
/usr/bin /usr/sbin. Use the menus to perform any task that they are
able to do - the shell and commands are only there in case something
goes wrong. In particular, you should always use the menus, not the
shell, to activate your swap partition, because the menu software
can't detect that you've done this from the shell. Press LeftAlt-F1
to get back to menus. Linux provides up to 64 virtual consoles,
although the Rescue floppy only uses a few of them.
<p>
<dt><i>Last Chance!</i>
<p>
<dd>Did we tell you to back up your disks? Here's your first chance to
wipe out all of the data on your disks, and your last chance to save
your old system. If you haven't backed up all of your disks, remove
the floppy from the drive, reset the system, and run backups.
<p>
<dt><i>Partition Your Hard Disks</i>
<p>
<dd>If you have not already partitioned your disks for Linux native and
Linux swap filesystems, the menu item Next will be Partition a Hard
Disk. If you have already created at least one Linux Native and one
Linux Swap disk partition, the Next menu selection will be
Initialize and Activate the Swap Disk Partition, or you may even
skip that step if your system had low memory and you were asked to
activate the swap partition as soon as the system started. Whatever
the Next menu selection is, you can use the down-arrow key to select
Partition a Hard Disk.
<p>
The Partition a Hard Disk menu item presents you with a list of disk
drives you can partition, and runs the cfdisk program, which allows
you to create and edit disk partitions. The cfdisk manual page is
included with this document, and you should read it now. You must
create one "Linux" (type 83) disk partition, and one "Linux Swap"
(type 82) partition.
<p>
Your swap partition will be used to provide virtual memory for the
system and should be between 16 and 128 megabytes in size, depending
on how much disk space you have and how many large programs you want
to run. Linux will not use more than 128 megabytes of swap, so
there's no reason to make your swap partition larger than that. a
swap partition is strongly recommended, but you can do without one
if you insist, and if your system has more than 16 megabytes of RAM.
If you wish to do this, please select the Do Without a Swap
Partition item from the menu.
<p>
The "Linux" disk partition will hold all of your files, and you may
make it any size between 40 megabytes and the maximum size of your
disk minus the size of the swap partition. If you are already
familiar with Unix or Linux, you may want to make additional
partitions - for example, you can make partitions that will hold the
/var, and /usr, filesystems.
<p>

<dt><i>Initialize and Activate the Swap Disk Partition</i>
<p>
<dd>This will be the Next menu item once you have created one disk
partition. You have the choice of initializing and activating a new
swap partition, activating a previously-initialized one, and doing
without a swap partition. It's always permissible to re-initialize a
swap partition, so select Initialize and Activate the Swap Disk
Partition unless you are sure you know what you are doing. This menu
choice will give you the option to scan the entire partition for
un-readable disk blocks caused by defects on the surface of the hard
disk platters. This is useful if you have MFM, RLL, or older SCSI
disks, and never hurts. Properly-working IDE disks don't need this
choice, as they have their own internal mechanism for mapping out
bad disk blocks.
<p>
The swap partition provides virtual memory to supplement the RAM
memory that you've installed in your system. It's even used for
virtual memory while the system is being installed. That's why we
initialize it first.
<p>
<dt><i>Initialize a Linux Disk Partition</i>
<p>
<dd>At this point, the Next menu item should be Initialize a Linux Disk
Partition. If it isn't, it's because you haven't completed the disk
partitioning process, or you haven't made one of the menu choices
dealing with your swap partition.
<p>
You can initialize a Linux Disk partition, or alternately you can
mount a previously-initialized one.
<p>
These floppies will not upgrade an old system without removing the
files - Debian provides a different procedure than using the boot
floppies for upgrading existing Debian systems. Thus, if you are
using old disk partitions that are not empty, you should initialize
them (which erases all files) here. You must initialize any
partitions that you created in the disk partitioning step. About the
only reason to mount a partition without initializing it at this
point would be to mount a partition upon which you have already
performed some part of the installation process using this same set
of installation floppies.
<p>
Select the Next menu item to initialize and mount the / disk
partition. The first partition that you mount or initialize will be
the one mounted as / (pronounced root). You will be offered the
choice to scan the disk partition for bad blocks, as you were when
you initialized the swap partition. It never hurts to scan for bad
blocks, but it could take 10 minutes or more to do so if you have a
large disk.
<p>
Once you've mounted the / partition, the Next menu item will be
Install the Base System unless you've already performed some of the
installation steps. You can use the arrow keys to select the menu
items to initialize and/or mount disk partitions if you have any
more partitions to set up. If you have created separate partitions
for /var, /usr, or other filesystems, you should initialize and/or
mount them now.
<p>
<dt><i>Install the Base System</i>
<p>
<dd>This should be the Next menu step after you've mounted your / disk,
unless you've already performed some of the installation steps on /.
Select the Install the Base System menu item. There will be a pause
while the system looks for a "local copy" of the base system. This
search is for CD-ROM installations and will not succeed, and you'll
be offered a menu of drives to use to read the base floppies. Select
the appropriate drive. Feed in the Base 1, 2, and 3 (and 4 if you
are using 1.2MB floppies) as requested by the program. If one of the
base floppies is unreadable, you'll have to create a replacement
floppy and feed all 3 (or 4) floppies into the system again. Once
the floppies have all been read, the system will install the files
it's read from them. This could take 10 minutes or more on slow
systems, less on faster ones.
<p>
<dt><i>Install the Operating System Kernel</i>
<p>
<dd>At this point, the Next menu item should be Install the Operating
System Kernel. Select it, and you will be prompted to select a
floppy drive and insert the rescue floppy. This will copy the kernel
on to the hard disk. In a later step this kernel will be used to
create a custom boot floppy for your system, and to make the hard
disk bootable without a floppy.
<p>
<dt><i>Install the Device Drivers</i>
<p>
<dd>Select the menu item to install the device drivers, and you'll be
prompted to insert the device drivers floppy. The device drivers
will be copied to your hard disk. Select the Configure Device
Drivers menu item and look for devices that are on your system.
Configure those device drivers, and they will be loaded whenever
your system boots.
<p>
There is a menu selection for PCMCIA device drivers, but you need
not use it . Once your system is installed, you can install the
pcmcia-cs package. This detects PCMCIA cards automatically, and
configures the ones it finds. It also copes with hot-plugging the
cards while the system is booted - they will all be configured as
they are plugged in, and de-configured when you unplug them.
<p>
<dt><i>Configure the Base System</i>
<p>
<dd>At this point you've read in all of the files that make up a minimal
Debian system, but you must perform some configuration before the
system will run. Select the Configure the Base System menu item.
<p>
You'll be asked to select your time zone. Look for your time zone or
region of the world in the menu, and type it at the prompt. This may
lead to another menu, in which you can select your actual time zone.
<p>
Next, you'll be asked if your system clock is to be set to GMT or
local time. Select GMT if you will only be running Linux and Unix on
your system, and select local time if you will be running another
operating system such as DOS or Windows. Unix and Linux keep GMT
time on the system clock and use software to convert it to the local
time zone. This allows them to keep track of daylight savings time
and leap years, and even allows users who are logged in from other
time zones to individually set the time zone used on their terminal.
If you run the system clock on GMT and your locality uses daylight
savings time, you'll find that the system adjusts for daylight
savings time properly on the days that it starts and ends.
<p>
<dt><i>Configure the Network</i>
<p>
<dd>You'll have to configure the network even if you don't have a
network, but you'll only have to answer the first two questions -
what is the name of your computer?, and is your system connected to
a network?.
<p>
If you are connected to a network, here come some questions that you
may not be able to figure out on your own - check with your system
administrator if you don't know:

<p>
<ul>
 <li> Your host name.
 <li> Your domain name.
 <li> Your computer's IP address.
 <li> The netmask to use with your network.
 <li> The IP address of your network.
 <li> The broadcast address to use on your network.
 <li> The IP address of the default gateway system you should route to,
   if your network has a gateway.
 <li> The system on your network that you should use as a
   DNS (Domain Name Service) server.
 <li> Whether you connect to the network using Ethernet.
</ul>

<p>Some technical details you might, or might not, find handy: the
program will guess that the network IP address is the bitwise-AND of
your system's IP address and your netmask. It will guess the
broadcast address is the bitwise OR of your system's IP address with
the bitwise negation of the netmask. It will guess that your gateway
system is also your DNS server. If you can't find any of these
answers, use the system's guesses - you can change them once the
system has been installed, if necessary, by editing
/etc/init.d/network .

<p>
<dt><i>Make the Hard Disk Bootable</i>
<p>
<dd>If you select to make the hard disk boot directly to Linux, you will
be asked to install a master boot record. If you aren't using a boot
manager (and this is probably the case if you don't know what a boot
manager is), answer yes to this question. The next question will be
whether you want to boot Linux automatically from the hard disk when
you turn on your system. This sets Linux to be the bootable
partition - the one that will be loaded from the hard disk. If you
answer no to this question, you can set the bootable partition later
using the DOS fdisk program, or with the Linux fdisk or activate
programs.
<p>
If you are installing Linux on a drive other than the first hard
disk in your system, be sure to make a boot floppy. The boot ROM of
most systems is only capable of directly booting from the first hard
drive, not the second one. You can, however, work around this
problem once you've installed your system. To do so, read the
instructions in the directory /usr/doc/lilo.
<p>
<dt><i>Make a Boot Floppy</i>
<p>
<dd>You should make a boot floppy even if you intend to boot the system
from the hard disk. The reason for this is that it's possible for
the hard disk bootstrap to be mis-installed, but a boot floppy will
almost always work. Select Make a Boot Floppy from the menu and feed
the system a blank floppy as directed. Make sure the floppy isn't
write-protected, as the software will format and write it. Mark this
the "Custom Boot" floppy and write-protect it once it has been
written.
<p>
<dt><i>The Moment of Truth</i>
<p>
<dd>This is what electrical engineers call the smoke test - what happens
when you turn on a new system for the first time. Remove the floppy
disk from the floppy drive, and select the Reboot the System menu
item. If the Linux system doesn't start up, insert the Custom Boot
floppy you created and reset your system. Linux should boot. You
should see the same messages as when you first booted the
installation boot floppy, followed by some new messages.
<p>
<dt><i>Set the Root Password</i>
<p>
<dd>This is the password for the super-user, a login that bypasses all
security protection on your system. It should only be used to
perform system administration, and only for as short a time as
possible. Do not use root as your personal login. You will be
prompted to create a personal login as well, and that's the one you
should use to send and receive e-mail and perform most of your work,
not root. The reason to avoid using root's privileges is that you
might be tricked into running a trojan-horse program - that is a
program that takes advantage of your super-user power to compromise
the security of your system behind your back. Any good book on Unix
system administration will cover this topic in more detail -
consider reading one if it's new to you. The good news is that Linux
is probably more secure than other operating systems you might run
on your PC. DOS and Windows, for example, give all programs
super-user privilege. That's one reason that they have been so
plagued by viruses.
<p>
All of the passwords you create should contain from 6 to 8
characters, and should contain both upper and lower-case characters,
as well as punctuation characters.
<p>
Once you've added both logins, you'll be dropped into the dselect
program. The Dselect Tutorial is required reading before you run
dselect. Dselect allows you to select packages to be installed on
your system. If you have a CD-ROM or hard disk containing the
additional Debian packages that you want to install on your system,
or you are connected to the Internet, this will be useful to you
right away. Otherwise, you may want to quit dselect and start it
later, once you have transported the Debian package files to your
system. You must be the super-user (root) when you run dselect. If
you are about to install the X Window system and you do not use a US
keyboard, you should read the X11 Release note for non-US-keyboard
users.
<p>
<dt><i>Log In</i>
<p>
<dd>After you've quit dselect, you'll be presented with the login
prompt. Log in using the personal login and password you selected.
Your system is now ready to use.

<h2>2. Running Debian GNU/Linux.</h2>

<p>This section will deal Debian packaging system and debian specific
utilities. Ab ovo.
   
<p><b>2.1 Debian packaging system and package installation utilities</b>

<p>
Debian distributions comes in archives called packages. Every
package is a collection of files (software, usually) that can be
installed using "dpkg" or "dselect". In addition the package
contains some information about it self that is read by the
installation utilities. 

   
<p><b>2.1.1 Package Classifications</b>

<p>
The packages included with Debian GNU/Linux are classified according
to how essential they are (priority), and according to their
functionality (section).
<p>
The "priority" of a package indicates how essential or necessary it
is.  We have classified all packages into four different priority
levels:

<p><dl>

<dt><i>Required</i>
<p><dd>
"Required" packages are packages that must be installed for the
system to correctly operate.  The required packages are the packages
that were installed with the base system.  Thus, they are already
installed.  Never, never, never remove a required package from the
system unless you are <i>absolutely sure</i> what you are doing.  This
bears repeating.  Never, never, never remove a required package from
the system unless you are <i>absolutely sure</i> what you are doing.  It
is likely that doing so will render your system completely unusable.
<p>
Required packages are abbreviated in dselect as "Req".
<p>
<dt><i>Important</i>
<p><dd>
"Important" packages are packages that are found on almost all
Unix-like operating systems.  Such packages include cron', man', and
vi'.
<p>
Important packages are abbreviated in dselect as "Imp".
<p>
<dt><i>Standard</i>
<p><dd>
"Standard" packages are packages that, more or less,
comprise what we consider to be the "standard", character-based
Debian GNU/Linux system.  The Standard system includes a fairly
complete software development environment and GNU Emacs.
<p>
Standard packages are abbreviated in dselect as "Std".
<p>	  
<dt><i>Optional</i>
<p><dd>
"Optional" packages are packages that comprise a fairly complete
system.  The Optional system includes a fairly complete TeX
environment and the X Window System.
<p>
Optional packages are abbreviated in dselect as "Opt".
<p>	       
<dt><i>Extra</i>
<p><dd>
"Extra" packages are packages that are only useful to a small or
select group of people, or that would be installed for a specific
purpose rather than as a general part of an operating system.  Such
packages include electronics and ham radio packages.
<p>
Extra packages are abbreviated in dselect as "Xtr".
</dl>
<p>
By default, dselect automatically selects the Standard system, if
the user doesn't want to individually select the packages to be
installed.
<p>
The "section" of a package indicates the functionality or use of a
package.  Packages on the CD-ROM and in FTP archive are arranged
according to section.  The section names are fairly
self-explanatory: for example, the category admin' contains packages
for system administration, and the category devel' contains packages
for software development and programming.  Unlike priority levels,
there are many sections, and more will probably be added in the
future, so we do not individually describe any of them in the
manual.
<p>
 <b>2.1.2 Package Relationships</b>
<p>
Each package includes information about how it relates to the other
packages included with the system.  There are four package
relationships in Debian GNU/Linux: conflicts, dependencies,
recommendations, and suggestions.
<p>
A "conflict" occurs when two or more packages <i>cannot</i> be installed
on the same system at the same time.  A good example of conflicting
packages are mail transfer agents (MTAs).  A mail transfer agent is
a program that delivers electronic mail to other users on the system
or to other machines on the network.  Debian GNU/Linux includes two
<i>alternative</i> mail transfer agents: sendmail' and smail'.
<p>
Only one mail transfer agent can be installed on the system at a
time, as they both do the same job and are not designed to coexist.
Therefore, the sendmail' and smail' packages conflict.  If you try
to install sendmail' when smail' is already installed, the package
maintenance system will refuse to install it.  Likewise, if you try
to install smail' when sendmail' is already installed, it will
refuse to install it.
<p>
A "dependency" occurs when one package requires another package to
function properly.  Continuing our electronic mail example, users
read mail with programs called mail user agents (MUAs).  Popular
mail user agents include elm', pine', and Emacs RMAIL.  It is normal
to install several MUAs at once, so these packages do not conflict.
But a mail user agent does not deliver mail--it uses the mail
transfer agent to do that.  Therefore, all mail user agent packages
depend on a mail transfer agent.
<p>
A package can also "recommend" or "suggest" other related packages.
<p>
 <b>2.1.3 Dselect</b>
<p>
META: This section provides brief tutorial on Debian Dselect, for
more detailed explanation please refer to Dselect Manual located at
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/Debian-1.2/disks-i386/current/dselect.beginner.6.html">
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/Debian-1.2/disks-i386/current/dselect.beginner.6.html</a>
<p>
Dselect is simple menu driven interface that will help you install
packages. It is used to select packages you wish to install. 
<p>
It will step you through the package installation process as follows:
<p>
<ul>
    <li>    Choose the access method to use.
     <li>   Update list of available packages, if possible.
     <li>   Request which packages you want on your system.
     <li>   Install and upgrade wanted packages.
     <li>   Configure any packages that are unconfigured.
     <li>   Remove unwanted software. 
</ul>
<p>

The main dselect screen looks like that:

<pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------

Debian Linux `dselect' package handling front end.
   0. [A]ccess      Choose the access method to use.
   1. [U]pdate      Update list of available packages, if possible.
   2. [S]elect      Request which packages you want on your system.
   3. [I]nstall     Install and upgrade wanted packages.
   4. [C]onfig      Configure any packages that are unconfigured.
   5. [R]emove      Remove unwanted software.
   6. [Q]uit        Quit dselect.

------------------------------------------------------------------   
</pre>

<p>
META: There are two ways of selecting the option from the menu, one
is choosing it with arrows, another one is pressing the key in []'s.

<p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Access</i>
<p><dd>
In this menu you can choose the method you will use for
obtaining/installing the packages.
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=6>
<tr> <td> <i>Abbrev.</i> </td><td><i> Description</i><br></td></tr>

<tr><td>  cdrom          </td><td>Install from a CD-ROM.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>  nfs            </td><td>Install from an NFS server (not yet mounted).<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>  harddisk       </td><td>Install from a hard disk partition (not yet mounted).<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>  mounted        </td><td>Install from a filesystem which is already mounted.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>  floppy         </td><td>Install from a pile of floppy disks.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>  ftp            </td><td>Install using ftp.<br></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<dt><i>Update</i>
<p><dd>
Dselect will read the packages list file (exactly the same file that
was discussed in the 1.3 section) and will create a database of
available packages locally on your system.
<p>
<dt><i>Select</i>
<p>
This is where you select the packages, choose your love and hit
&lt;Enter&gt;. If you have a slow machine be aware that the screen will
clear and can remain blank for 15 seconds so don't start bashing keys
at this point.  The first thing that comes up on the screen is page 1 of
the Help file.  You can get to this help by hitting ? at any point in the
Select screens and you can page through the help screens by hitting the
. (full stop) key. 
<p>
To exit the Select screen after all selections are complete, hit &lt;Enter&gt;.
This will return you to the main screen _if_ there are no problems
with your selection.  Else you will be asked to deal with those problems.
When you are happy with any given screen hit &lt;Enter&gt; to get out.
<p>
<i>Problems</i> are quite normal and are to be expected.  If you select
package A and that package requires package B to run, then dselect
will warn you of the problem and will most likely suggest a solution.
If package A conflicts with package B (they are mutually exclusive)
you will be asked to decide between them. 
<p>
<dt><i>Install</i>
<p><dd>
Dselect runs through the entire 800 packages and installs those selected.
Expect to get asked to make decisions as you go.  It is often useful to
switch to a different shell to compare, say, an old config with a new one.
If the old file is conf.modules the new one will be conf.modules.dpkg-new.
<p>
The screen scrolls past fairly quickly on a new machine.  You can stop/start
it with ^S/^Q and at the end of the run you will get a list of any
uninstalled packages.  If you want to keep a record of everything that
happens use normal Unix features like tee or script. 
<p>
<dt><i>Configure</i>
<p><dd>
Most packages get configured in step 3, but anything left hanging can be
configured here.
<p>
<dt><i>Remove</i>
<p><dd>
Remove packages that no longer needed.
<p>
<dt><i>Quit</i>
<p><dd>
Au revoir.
</dl>
<p>

<b> 2.1.4 Dpkg</b>
<p>
META: This section provides a brief tutorial on Debian Dpkg program.
<p>
Dpkg is command line tool for installing and manipulating debian
packages. It has several switches, which allow you to install,
configure, update, remove and do other operations on debian packages
(even build your own).  Dpkg also allowd you to list the available
packages, list files 'owned' by packages, find which package the file
is owned by, et cetera.

<p>
<dl>

<dt><i>Installing new packages / updating existing ones.</i>
<p><dd>
It's as simple as any other dpkg operation.  All you have to do is to
type the following command:
<pre>
# dpkg -i &lt;filename.deb&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file containing a debian package,
such as, 'tcsh_6.06-11_i386.deb'.  Dpkg is partly interactive; during
the installation it may ask you additional questions, such as, wether
to install the new version of a configuration file, or to keep the old
one.
<p>
You may also unpack a package without configuring it: type:
<pre>
dpkg --unpack &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>
If the package you are trying to install depends on a non-existing
package or on a newer version of a package you have, or if any other
problem occurs during the installation, dpkg will abort with a verbose
error message.
<p>
<dt><i>Configure installed packages</i>
<p>
<dd>It happens that dpkg aborts during an installation and leaves the
package installed, though unconfigured.  It also happens that the
users unpack packages without configuring it.  Debian packaging system
requires the package to be configured to avoid dependency problems.
More than that, some packages require configuration to work properly.
<p>
To configure it, simply type:
<pre>
dpkg --configure &lt;package&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;package&gt; is the name of the package, such as, 'tcsh' (which is
not the same thing as a filename we mentioned above).
<p>
<dt><i>Removing installed packages</i>
<p>
<dd>In Debian package system, there are two ways to murder a package,
called 'remove' and 'purge'.  The 'remove' switch just removes the
specified package; the 'purge' switch also purges the configuration
files.  The usage is:
<pre>
dpkg -r &lt;package&gt;
dpkg --purge &lt;package&gt;
</pre>
Of course, if there are any installed packages that depend on the one
you wish to remove, the package will <i>not</i> be removed, and dpkg will
abort with a verbose error message.
<p>

<dt><i>Reporting package status</i>
<p><dd>

To report the status of the package (i.e., installed, not installed,
unconfigured, etc.), type:
<pre>
dpkg -s &lt;package&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<dt><i>Listing available packages</i>
<p><dd>
To list the installed packages that match some pattern, type:
<pre>
dpkg -l [&lt;package-name-pattern&gt;]
</pre>
where &lt;package-name-pattern&gt; is an optional argument specifying a
pattern for the package names to match, such as, "*sh".  Yes, normal
shell wildcards are allowed.  If you don't specify the pattern, all
the installed packages will be listed.
<p>
<dt><i>Listing files 'owned' by package</i>
<p><dd>
To list all the files owned by a particular package, simply type:
<pre>
dpkg -L &lt;package&gt;
</pre>
However, it will not list the files created by package-specific
installation scripts.
<p>
<dt><i>Finding package 'owning' a file</i>
<p><dd>

To find the package wich is 'owning' a particular file, type the
following command:
<pre>
dpkg -S &lt;filename-pattern&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;filename-pattern&gt; is the pattern for the file to search for.
Again, normal shell wildcards are allowed.
<p>
<dt><i>Summary</i>
<p>
<dd>Dpkg is very simple to use and is preferred over dselect when all you
have to do is to install, upgrade or remove a small number of
packages.  It also has some functionality which dselect (which is, in
fact, an interface to dpkg) doesn't have, such as, finding package
'owning' a file.  Here we haven't describe all the options dpkg have.
For the full list, refer to dpkg(8) man page.

<h2>3. About Debian</h2>

<p><b>3.1 Debian community</b>
<p>
Debian project was created by Ian Murdock in 1993, initially under the
sponsorship of the Free Software Foundation's GNU project.  Later,
Debian has parted from FSF.  Debian was created is the result of a
volunteer effort to create a free, high-quality Unix-compatible
operating system based on Linux kernel, complete with a suite of
applications.
<p>
Debian community is a group of above 150 unpaid volunteers from over
the world who collaborate via the Internet.  The founders of the
project have formed the organization "Software in the Public Interest"
to sponsor Debian GNU/Linux development.
<p>
<b>Software in the Public Interest</b>
<p>
Software in the Public Interest (SPI) is a non-profit organization
formed when FSF withdrew their sponsorship of Debian.  The purpose of
the organization is to develop and distribute free software.  Its
goals are very much like those of FSF, and it encourages programmers
to use the GNU General Public License on their programs.  However, SPI
has a slightly different focus in that it is building and distributing
a Linux system that diverges in many technical details from the GNU
system planned by FSF.  SPI still communicates with FSF, and it
cooperates in sending them changes to GNU software and in asking its
users to donate to FSF and the GNU project.

  3.3 Bug tracing system.</b>
<p>
Debian project has a bug tracing system which handles the bug reports
provided by users. As soon as the bug report is received, the bug is

	After much delay I've finally started learning about the Blue Moon
	Rendering Tools (BMRT).  It seemed only natural that I take what I
	learned and pass it on to my readers.  So, starting this month, I'm
	going to do a three part series on BMRT and RenderMan&reg 
	shaders.  I've gotten help, of course.  My thanks go out
	to Paul Sargent for providing example code and a place to bounce
	ideas off and to Larry Gritz, author of BMRT, for general support 
	and technical assistance.
	The first in this 3 part series is an
	introduction to the tools and some relatively simple
	examples on how to use them.
	
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Although the BMRT articles are a big project in themselves, I don't
	want to devote 3 entire issues of the Muse to just BMRT.  
	In this months column I'll also be covering a few other topics.
	<UL>
		<LI> A review of Mark Kilgard's <I>OpenGL Programming for 
			the X Window System</I>.
		<LI> Information on scanner support for Linux.
	</UL>
	Both of these are go into some detail.  Along with the usual set of 
	Mews offerings, this should be enough to hold you until next month.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	I was going to do a bit on John Beale's wonderful tool, HF-Lab, 
	this month but
	decided to wait until next month.  I happened to run across a few other
	POV-Ray tips recently and thought that the set of tips along with 
	the HF-Lab review would fit well together.  Look for them next month.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	An update on my crashed system woes:  my little network at home uses a
	386 16Mhz Dell computer as a server for doing backups.  I had set it up
	but had not implemented the backups when my main system bit the bucket.
	After getting my main system running again I ended up with some extra
	drives that I wanted to put in my server.  I first tried to make backups of
	my main system, across the network, using a version of taper that I had
	installed on my main system and just copied over to the server.  That sort
	of worked, but for some reason taper wouldn't see some of my target
	directories.  I figured it was incompatible with the installation I had on
	the 386, so I upgraded to Linux Pro (which is what I installed on my main
	system).  Mistake.  The server stopped working.  The problem is a secondary
	IDE that I added to make use of the extra hard disks.  I mucked with it for
	a week, got fed up and now have a new Cyrix 166, motherboard, and mini
	tower on order.  The motherboard and 166 are going in the main box, and the
	old 486 and motherboard are going in the mini tower.  I'm retiring the 386.
	It will take its rightful place next to my retired Wyse286 PC with its
	20M hard drive.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	I never wanted to be a system administrator.  I just want to <B>use</B>
	my systems.  <I>sigh</I>  At least with Linux I have more control over
	what I use.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	So, one month after disaster hit I still don't have reliable backups 
	running.  There is money to be made in making backups easy for Linux
	users.  I guarantee it.

		<P><FONT size=3><B>Q and A</B></FONT>
		<P>
		<I>Q: Is displacment mapping the same thing as reaction-diffusion?
		</I>
		<P>
		A: 
		No.  Reaction-diffusion simulates the mixing of chemicals, which
		is theorized to have something to do with certain organic texture
		patterns, like leopard skin.
		<P>
		Bump mapping is perturbing the normal of an object to simulate
		bumps, but without actually moving points on the surface.
		<P>
		Displacement mapping does what bump mapping merely simulates -
		it actually distorts the surface points of the
		object which is being mapped.  This avoids
		artifacts you get from the bump mapping approximation (like actually
		making the silhouettes rough).                 
		You can think of it as a height field over an arbitrary surface.

		<P>
		<I>Q:
		What is a stochastic raytracer and are there any freely
		available?
		</I>

		<P>A:
		"Stochastic sampling" or "distribution ray tracing" (it's not called
		distributed these days) refers to placing samples at irregular
		intervals, rather than regularly spacing them.  It doesn't have
		anything to do with the number of rays per pixel -- 1 sample per pixel
		can easily be jittered, and 100 samples per pixel can be regularly
		spaced.  Also, it's not dependent on ray tracing -- PRMan uses
		stochastic sampling and it uses a scanline method.
		<P>
		Technically, stochastic sampling transfers high frequency signal
		energy above the Nyquist limit into noise, rather than having that
		energy alias as lower frequencies.  It's just trading one artifact for
		another, but by coincidence the human visual system appears to find
		noise less objectionable than aliasing.
		<P>
		BMRT is a stochastic raytracers.  POV-Ray is reported to be
		(but no official word if it is or not).
		Others include (not all are raytracers):
		PRMan, Mental Ray, and Alias.

		<P>
		Thanks to Larry Gritz for these definitions.

		<P>
		<I>Q:
		What is tessellation?
		</I>

		<P>A:
		Mark Kilgard writes the following in his 
		<I>OpenGL Programming for the X Window System</I>:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		In computer graphics, tessellation is the process of breaking a
		complex geometric surface into simple convex polygons.  
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		The use of convex polygons allow for better performance in OpenGL.

		<P>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		There are a growing number of Application Programming 
		Interfaces (API's) available for Linux that enable software 
		developers to create programs that render 3D graphics.  
		Some of these are designed to allow programs to output
		data files that can be used by rendering engines to create
		a 3D image either to a display or to a file.  The libribout.a
		static library in the BMRT package is an example of this 
		kind of interface.   It allows the software developer to 
		write a program to output a RIB formatted file which can
		then be used by a RenderMan&reg compliant renderer.
		Other tools are designed for interactive 3D display.  
		One such developer tool is OpenGL.
		OpenGL is, if not the grandfather, the God Father
		of all interactive 3D development tools.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		OpenGL is an API designed by Silicon Graphics and now 
		managed by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board.  
		It is defined by the <I>OpenGL Programming Guide</I> 
		as follows:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<FONT size=2>
			The OpenGL graphics system is a software interface to graphics 
			hardware.  (The GL stands for Graphics Library.)  It allows
			you to create interactive programs that produce color images
			of moving three-dimensional objects.
			</FONT>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		The interface is a window system independent interface
		to graphics hardware.  In order to use OpenGL with a particular
		windowing system it must be used with a supplemental API.
		This supplemental API allows OpenGL to create its graphics contexts
		and windows in which OpenGL will do its rendering.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Linux uses as its windowing system the X Windowing system, as do
		most, if not all, other Unices.  To use OpenGL with X Windows the
		software developer must become familiar with GLX, the X Extension
		for OpenGL, along with one or more toolkits such as the X Toolkit
		(Xt) and a widget set like Motif (Xm).  This is not a simple task.
		Just learning Xm can be a full time occupation (I know, its what
		I do now).  Fortunately, Mark Kilgard has provided a very thorough
		text on integrating OpenGL with the X environment:
		<I>OpenGL Programming for the X Windows System</I>.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		This text contains 6 detailed chapters, 1 chapter devoted to 
		an example application, and a number of very useful appendices.
		The first two chapters introduce the reader to OpenGL and the
		two libraries that generally accompany it:  GLU, the GL Utility
		library that is used for certain operations that are hardware
		inspecific such as polygon tesselation, and GLX.  The introduction
		is quite good except for explaining the use of GLU.  All OpenGL
		functions are prefixed with "gl" except for the GLU functions which
		are prefixed with "glu".  I can understand why they did this, but
		it is confusing to remember that OpenGL is actually two sets of 
		functions with different prefixes (as if the X Windows system 
		didn't provide enough of these already).

		Chapter 3 is a detailed explanation of how to use OpenGL
		with Motif.  The basic premise is that you need to combine OpenGL
		(gl and glu routines) with the X Extension for OpenGL (GLX) and
		the widget set of choice (Xm along with Xt to manage the widget
		set).  That seems like a lot of work.  Not to mention that writing 
		an OpenGL application this way, with the X calls embedded in the source,
		removes the portability that a developer originally had with just
		OpenGL.  It would be nice if there were a way to remove the X
		calls and have a truly portable OpenGL application.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		There is.  Mark introduces the GLUT library in Chapter 4
		which hides most (not all) of the window system specific API calls 
		from the developer.  This toolkit, although not necessarily
		appropriate for full-featured OpenGL applications, provides an
		example of a toolkit which can handle window system API's for
		the developer and allow the developer to write a single source code
		base portable to any platform.  The toolkit itself can be implemented
		in X, Windows NT or any other windowing system.  The application
		developer only needs access to the toolkit.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Chapter 4 is an introduction to the more basic features of GLUT.
		It covers such topics as window managment, callbacks, and font rendering.
		Chapter 5 goes into significantly more depth.  Its 90+ pages cover
		topics ranging from lighting and texture mapping to using images
		and bitmaps to curves and surfaces.  This chapter will be the one
		most readers will refer to repeatedly when they've gotten past
		their first sample OpenGL programs using GLUT.  Chapter 6 covers
		advanced topics such as the X Input Extension, Overlays, and
		peformance issues.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		There are 3 appendices, the most interesting of which is the
		"Functional Description of the GLUT API".  This is a reference
		section for the most part although it is not formatted with one page 
		per function.  This makes it a little hard to find what you're
		looking for since more than one function can be on a page.  Other than 
		that its a fairly complete description of the GLUT API.  There is
		also a glossary that follows the appendices.
		
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Mark includes extensive sample code right from the start of the text.
		All the code is available for download from the Internet.
		The code is easy to follow and the accompanying text is well
		written.  Although Mark does not spend time explaining how to program 
		with the X Windows System (knowledge of which is a prerequisite 
		for this text)
		he does thoroughly cover how to integrate OpenGL with the X 
		environment.  After explaining how this would work he then provides
		detailed information about how to remove the windowing system
		specific calls by using GLUT.  

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		I find <I>OpenGL Programming for the X Windows System</I>
		a very well written, thoroughly descriptive explanation on how
		software developers can integrate OpenGL with their X Windows
		applications.

The following links are just starting points for finding more information
about computer graphics and multimedia in general for Linux systems.  If
you have some application specific information for me, I'll add them to my
other pages or you can contact the maintainer of some other web site.  I'll
consider adding other general references here, but application or site
specific information needs to go into one of the following general

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In December my brother called me to let me know he had a possible Christmas
gift for me:  a Compaq Keyboard Scanner.  He works for Compaq and they had
a special for employees.  Knowing I might not have a Linux driver for this he
called to ask.  I didn't know, so I started to investigate.  I checked the
one place I knew I could ask questions like this and get reasonably accurate
answers - the Gimp Developer and User mailing lists.  I posted a message
asking if anyone knew about scanners and this scanner in particular.
Quite a few people answered.  It turns out this particular scanner is
actually an OEM'd version of the Visioneer keyboard scanner.  The protocol
this scanner uses in not publicly available and apparently its rather
difficult to get on the developers list to get the information.  So much
for getting support for this little device.
However, the amount of information I gathered about other scanner devices,
about 14 pages of printed material, turned out to be a real windfall.
I decided to summarize it here in the Muse.
<P>
First, lets list the set of scanners known to have support.  This list is a
compilation based on what the drivers say they support and what individuals
have said they are specifically using.

The HP scanners appear to all require a generic SCSI interface, such as an
Adaptec AHA 152x board and its associated driver, and the hpscanpbm user
level driver.  The SCSI board that comes with some (or possibly all, I'm
not sure) of the HP scanners is not supported at this time.

<BR clear=both>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Knowing which scanners are supported is one thing.  Now you need to find a
driver that goes with them.  The information I got was provided by the
son of a coworker of my brother.  Apparently he had some free time and had
gone out and gathered this list on his own.  
Not all the information was complete and I filled in the rest by perusing
the sunsite and tsx-11 archives.  I also received information on some of
the drivers from the developers.

I don't know what the difference between the pbmscan and logiscan packages is
but suspect the pbmscan package is a front end to the logiscan package.
The logiscan package has a front end called gifscan that uses SVGALIB 
(not an X interface) and saves the input into GIF files.  The pbmscan
package scans directly into PBM formatted files.

This package makes use of the GNU Configure mechanism.  Unfortunately it

I couldn't test the programs or drivers out, unfortunately
since I don't have a QuickCam or any scanners yet.
Feel free to donate either, of course.

There are notes in the distribution about ongoing work for support for
non-Unix platforms, but I have little interest in that so didn't really
read through it.

And of course, what would a scanner review be without some user
testimonials.  These are taken from the discussions on scanners in the Gimp
User and Gimp Developer mailing lists.  I didn't keep track of email
addresses so all I have are the first names of the respondents.  As with
any unverifiable testimonials, take these with a grain of salt.

	I'm using an HP Scanjet IIC (predecessor to the CX) with Linux and Gimp,
	and am very pleased with the results.  I've a feeling (unsubstantiated),
	that not much changed between the two models other than the driver
	software that HP shipped with each.
	There's a good HP scanner driver for Linux called 'hpscanpbm' - available
	from the usual sources.  It's command-line driven, but offers very good
	control over resolution, brightness, contrast etc.  Output format is pbm
	only, unfortunately. So far, it's the only HP driver for Linux that I've
	seen.

	I have a Microtek ScanMaker E3, which is a 24-bit flatbed scanner with a
	300x600dpi optical resolution, that can be had for right around $300. It
	comes with some pretty decent image editing software for the Mac and for
	Windows, and there's a (command-line-driven) driver available for Linux
	(mtekscan). With any luck, the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) project will
	have a driver available in the not-too-distant future (if I ever find time
	to write the driver, that is. :) The SANE driver will allow standalone
	scanning as well as a GIMP plug-in. The driver will probably work with
	other Microtek scanners as well (mtekscan was actually written for a
	ScanMaker E6 but works with my E3). - name unknown

	As for Musteks, I was considering a 30-bit, 400x800dpi Mustek scanner (I
	don't remember the model), until I read a review which compared that
	scanner to a few other scanners (mostly 24-bit). The Mustek wasn't
	particularly impressive; I finally decided to go with the Microtek--even
	though inferior "on paper" it still received a much better review.
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	In any case, you can't go wrong with a Microtek, I think. I've also read
	good things about the UMAX (which are also rather inexpensive), a Canon (a
	little more expensive), and of course HP scanners are generally top-notch,
	although they also command premium prices. If you have the bucks, go for
	an HP, but if you want to save a few dollars and still get an excellent
	quality product, there are other options. - name unknown

A few people responded to my request for information on the Gimp mailing
lists with information for non-Linux systems.  I normally don't write about
these, but I'll go ahead this one time.  Note that I don't want to write
about other OS's - not because they aren't any good, but because Linux
works for me and I don't have the time to wander around the OS world
looking for yet another OS.

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thats it.  Hopefully this information will help you get started looking for
a scanner and the appropriate software to use with it.  I have high
expectations for the SANE project to be the primary interface for low-level
and user-level drivers for all scanners in the future.  Once a generic
interface is defined it should be easier to develop applications that can
make real use of the scanners.

<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A couple of years ago, right after Toy Story had been released, I began to
gather as much information on computer graphics as I could find. 
At first I had been looking for general information. Later, when I
found out such tools existed for Windows and Mac systems, I began to look
around for various 3D rendering and modelling tools that would run on Unix systems.
The first tool I found was POV-Ray, a tool that has been ported to many
platforms including a number of Unix OS's.  I also found a number of other
tools such as Polyray and Radiance. 
Since I was very new to 3D tools I started with POV-Ray.  
It had a large amount of online information (much of which has
been scaled back on the Internet), a large user base that frequented the 
comp.graphics.rendering.raytracing
newsgroup, and it had printed texts available.  This last item
was the most important element to me.  I needed documentation I didn't have 
to print off myself and that was fairly well organized.  I tended to carry
it around to read at lunch on work days.

<A HREF="./source/create_text">
<I>font3d</I></A>
tool, which can
output RIB files.
</CENTER>

<BR clear=both>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Not long after discovering POV-Ray I came across another tool called BMRT.
BMRT is actually a set of tools that are
compliant with the RenderMan Interface Specification.  This
specification is the same one used by <I>PRMan</I>, the tool used by Pixar to
create Toy Story.  Although I wanted to learn more about BMRT 
I really didn't have the background to understand how to use such
tools.  POV-Ray's documentation allowed me to learn some basics up front.
After about a year of working on POV-Ray, along with continued research 
in other areas of computer graphics, I began to
look once again at BMRT.  I now better understand what it does.
Its time to learn to use it.

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	In this first of three articles on BMRT I'll 
	be describing the package contents and introduce you to the basics of
	how to use the BMRT tools.  You should keep 
	in mind that much of the terminology might be new to you and so 
	the early introductions and descriptions might not make too much sense.  
	I apologize for this, but describing such a powerful package as BMRT
	and the RenderMan Specification in one introductory article is
	not easy.  Fear not, however.  
	I'll be explaining all of the package contents in some detail 
	further along in this article.  This won't be a complete, all encompassing 
	tutorial.  But it should be enough to get you started.  After you get
	done here, go 
	<A HREF="#ordering-info">
	order the RenderMan Specification</A>
	from Pixar.  It
	is a very well written and easy to follow description of what BMRT
	implements.  It also provides the reference guide necessary to
	understand the C and RIB bindings to the RenderMan interface.

	<H3>What is BMRT?</H3>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	BMRT stands for the
	Blue Moon Rendering Tools.  It is a set of tools and libraries created by
	Larry Gritz, who now works at Pixar, that allow the previewing and 
	rendering of
	3D models and scenes.  The rendering engines (programs) and static 
	libraries (used to create applications that can output RIB files) 
	are all compatible with
	the RenderMan Interface Standard developed by Pixar.  
	RenderMan is <B>not</B> an actual piece of software,
	although many people use the terms <I>RenderMan</I>
	and <I>PRMam</I> (Pixar's software implementation of the RenderMan
	specification) interchangeably.
	It is a specification stating how a modeling system 
	communicates with a rendering system.   BMRT is an implementation
	of the rendering system with a static library provided for use with
	modeling systems, including stand-alone programs.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	BMRT's rendering tools support ray tracing, radiosity,
	area light sources, texture and environment mapping, programmable shading
	in the RenderMan Shading Language, 
	motion blur, automatic ray cast shadows, 
	CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry), depth of field,
	support of imager and volume shaders, 
	and other advanced features. The toolkit also contains quick RIB
	previewers (using OpenGL and X11) to allow "pencil tests" of scenes 
	and animations. 

	<H3>Current Release and Where to Get it</H3>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	At the time of this writing, February 22, 1997, the latest release 
	of BMRT is 2.3.5.  It is available from the
	<A HREF="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html">
	BMRT Web site (http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html)</A>.
	This site also contains example images and pointers to other
	RenderMan related sites on the Web.  Larry only provides precompiled
	versions of the renderers and the RIB and shader libraries.  He does,
	however, provide a set of shaders in source form along with their compiled
   versions.  We'll discuss shaders a little later.  Versions of BMRT 
	are available for 
	<UL>
		<LI>SGI running IRIX 5.2 and up (mips1, mips2, and mips4 available) 
		<LI>Linux (i386/486/Pentium) 
		<LI>FreeBSD (i386/486/Pentium) 
		<LI>HP 9000 8xx/7xx running HP-UX 
		<LI>NEXTSTEP (HP, Motorola, Intel, and SPARC processors) 
		<LI>Sun SPARC (running Solaris)
	</UL>
	Larry doesn't expect to port BMRT to non-Unix style operating systems
	due to the logistics problems (access to machines, and so forth)
	inherint with cross-platform development.  There is no planned port for
	the MkLinux distribution at this time.  I don't know if he plans on
	working on a Digital Alpha or any other non-Intel Linux ports.

	<H3>What the package contains</H3>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	The distribution comes complete with what might be considered as a set 
	of user tools, a set of development tools, and documentation for both.
	Its not quite correct to refer to these as user or development tools
	due to the nature of the tools, but for this article such classification
	will help organize things a little better.

		<H4>User Tools - Renderers and Previewers</H4>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		These are the executable programs in the package that allow users
		to render and preview images.  There are 3 such programs:
		<UL TYPE=circle>
			<LI>rendribv - a wireframe previewer
			<LI>rgl - a polygon previewer that uses OpenGL 
			<LI>rendrib - the RenderMan compliant renderer
		</UL>
		Its easiest to remember these tools as the ones you'll need to
		render draft or final versions of your scenes.  The first two
		are generally used to render draft versions, the last to 
		render your final scene.  However, you don't create the scene files with 
		these tools.  Scene files contain the description of the objects
		that make up the scene.  These files use a format called RIB, the
		RenderMan Interface Bytestream format.
		Scene files can be created by hand (not a common practice), 
		by writing a C program that uses the developer
		tools described in the next section, or by modellers that can output
		files in the RIB format.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		RIB files describe the shape and positions of objects.  They
		provide the <I>geometry</I> of a scene.  They do not describe
		colors of objects, the texture on the surface of objects, nor 
		any aspect of lighting in the scene. This information is referenced
		by the RIB by using <I>shaders</I>.  Shaders 
		are external files that describe the
		appearance of the objects in a scene.  There are developer tools for
		creating and examining shader files.

		<H4>Developer Tools - libraries, compiler, etc</H4>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		The developer tools in BMRT are actually a set of 
		libraries and header files
		that are provided for users to create C programs that output
		RIB files or to parse shader source files.  
		The user programs can be specifically designed for a
		given scene or set of frames or could be part of a more 
		generalized modelling system, such as AC3D or SCED.
		Also included in the developer tools are programs for compiling 
		shader source files into their .so format and for examining compiled
		shader files to find their types, parameters, and initial values.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Shader source files look like ordinary C code.
		The source file is compiled into another format referred to as
		the <I>.so</I> file.
		The compiled .so versions are actually ASCII files.  The .so
		extension might be a little confusing to users who are familiar
		with creating shared libraries, but these are not shared
		object files.  They are plain text files.

		<BR clear=both>
		<UL TYPE=circle>
			<LH>The libraries and header files provided are:</LH>
			<LI>libribout.a, ri.h - used for producing RIB files
			<LI>libsoargs.a, so.h - used to parse compiled shaders
		</UL>
		<UL TYPE=circle>
			<LH>The programs used for compiling and examing shader files are:</LH>
			<LI>slc - shader compiler
			<LI>sotell - command line program for parsing compiled shaders
		</UL>
		Note that the distribution does not come with linkable libraries for
		the renderers.

		<H4>Docs</H4>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		There are only two pieces of documentation that come with the
		distribution, however both are quite well written and very
		good refernces.  
		<UL TYPE=circle>
			<LI>bmrt.html
			<LI>poets.ps
		</UL>
		The first is a detailed description of all the tools and how to use them.
		This is a very valuable reference for new users learning how to 
		get the most out of the programs by learning their command line
		arguments.  
		The second is a quick introduction to the RenderMan API.  It
		contains a brief description of the RIB format.  For more detailed
		information on the RIB format you should contact Pixar to get the 
		official RenderMan Interface 3.1 Specification.  Although the
		specification document is not written as a
		tutorial, it does contain detailed, reference-style 
		information on the RIB file format.
		For more information on contacting Pixar, see the

<H2>2. User Tools - Renderers and Previewers</H2>
	<H3>rendribv - wireframe previewer</H3>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		The first of the renderers, <I>rendribv</I>, 
		provides wireframe previews of the 
		input scene files.  The previews show geometric primitives without
		shading or removal of hidden lines.  A wireframe display uses
		"wire cages" to represent objects instead of representing them as
		solid surfaced objects.  The wireframe display requires the use
		of the X11 windowing system.  Rendribv has a number of command line
		options, all of which are explained in the accompanying
		documentation.   One important aspect to keep in mind is that
		<I>rendribv</I> was designed to display one or more frames of a RIB 
		file.  It offers a good way to preview an animation without the
		overhead that accompanies the shading of object surfaces.
		The <I>limbo.rib</I> example scene provides a sample
		animation.  On my 486DX2/66 with 40M memory the wireframe animation 
		is fairly smooth using <I>rendribv</I>.  Its even faster on my
		P75 laptop with 8M of memory.

	<H3>rgl - quick polygon previewer that uses OpenGL</H3>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Another previewer provided in the distribution is the <I>rgl</I> program.
		This renderer displays previews of scenes with simple 
		Gouraud shading of object surfaces using OpenGL 
		(OpenGL is a specification for a graphics interface from Silicon 
		Graphics - see this months review of Mark Kilgards 
		OpenGl Programming with the X Window System).  
		Gouraud shading is a method for
		helping to eliminate large changes in color intensities that can cause 
		banding.
		Hidden lines, those lines and 
		surfaces that should not be visible to the viewer because they are
		blocked by other lines or surfaces, are also removed.  Since
		<I>rgl</I>
		requires OpenGL, a port of an OpenGL library must be available 
		on a particular platform in order for Larry to port <I>rgl</I> 
		to that platform. 
		Fortunately, the MesaGL library is available for Linux, as well as
		some commercial ports of the official OpenGL libraries, so there
		is a working version of <I>rgl</I> available for Linux.  
		<I>rgl</I> is statically linked so you don't need any of the OpenGL
		or MesaGL libraries to use it.
		Other Unix distributions of BMRT may not have this program, however.

	<H3>rendrib - hiqh quality renderer w/raytracing and radiosity</H3>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		This is the gravy on the potatoes.  The <I>rendrib</I> program is a fully
		featured, RenderMan compliant renderer that provides not only
		the full feature set of the RenderMan Specification but also
		provides such things as ray tracing, radiosity, solid modeling, depth of
		field, motion blur, area light sources, texture mapping, 
		environment mapping, volume and imager shading, and support of the
		RenderMan Shading Language.  The latest version also supports
		displacement mapping, a method of mapping an image to a surface that
		not only changes the appearance of the surface but also the actual
		shape of that surface.  <I>Rendrib</I> is the tool to use when 
		rendering your final scene as it will produce the best, most
		realistic results of all the renderers provided.

	<H3>A word about compatibility with commercial Linux distributions</H3>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Version 2.3.4 of the BMRT rendering tools were built against 
		version 26 of the g++ library.  Version 2.3.5 is linked against
		version 27.  This is no problem if you're running one of the newer
		commercial Linux distributions since I believe 27 has been out for awhile
		and should be in most recent Linux distrubtions.  However, my
		laptop has an older Slackware 3.0 release which only has g++ v26.
		which means I can't run the v2.3.5 renderers on my laptop.  This
		isn't a big deal for me, but it is something you should be aware of
		when deciding to explore BMRT.  I don't know if Larry supplies older
		versions of BMRT so you may have to upgrade in order to use the
		latest distribution of BMRT.
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Note that the X and MesaGL/OpenGL libraries were statically linked
		to the renderers.   However, the C/C++ libraries are still
		dynamically linked, which is why you need to be aware of which 
		versions of these libraries are required.

<H2>3. Developer Tools - libraries, compiler, etc</H2>

	<H3>slc - shader langauge compiler</H3>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	The shader language compiler is a program which takes 
	shader language source files, those files ending in .sl, and compiles
	them into their compiled versions, those files ending in .so.  
	The compiled shader files appear to be code to a state machine used in the
	<I>rendrib</I>
	renderer that determines how shading is applied to a given object (I 
	don't know that for certain, but it seems a reasonable guess).
	RenderMan is a procedural interface. The shaders are procedures
	written in a C like language.  The must be compiled to be used with
	a RenderMan compliant renderer like BMRT.  The shader compiler
	turns the procedural shader into a format the renderer can handle.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Shaders come in many forms:  <B>surface shaders</B> which define how light
	<I>leaving</I> a point on an object will appear, <B>volume
	shaders</B> which define how light is affected as it passes <I>through</I> 
	an object (such as the atmosphere), light shaders which describe the 
	lighting of a scene,
	displacement shaders, transformation shaders, imager shaders, and so forth.  
	<I>rendrib</I> supports all of these shader types.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	The BMRT package comes with a fairly large number of shaders, some of
	which are required by the RenderMan specification and some of which
	Larry has provided as bonus shaders in conjunction with example scenes.

	</center>

	<P>
	Note that the .so files provided are the precompiled versions of the .sl
	files and that the .so files are <B>not</B> compatible with <I>PRMan</I>, 
	Pixar's
	RenderMan program.  The .sl source files are compatible, however.
	The reason for this comes from the methods used internally to
	<I>rendrib</I> and
	<I>PRMan</I> to produce the 3D images.  
	For more information see the section on 
	<I>Incompatibilities with PRMan</I> in the bmrt.html document in the
	doc directory of the distribution.

	<H3>sotell - lists the arguments to a compiled shader</H3>
	Another shader related tool is sotell.  This program allows the user
	to parse a shader object file for its type, list of parameters, and
	default settings.  What this is useful for will become more apparent in
	the next article which will cover the writing of shaders.  We'll touch
	briefly on using predefined shaders a little later in this article.

	<H3>libribout.a, ri.h - RenderMan library for producing RIB files</H3>
	These two files are used by developers who need to write applications
	to output their RIB files.  Remember, RIB files are the input files
	(including references to shaders) passed to the <I>rendrib</I> program.  
	There are two
	modellers on Linux that can output RIB files for you, SCED and AC3D, but
	you may find it convenient to write your own specialized application to
	output a series of specific frames.  In this case (or if you are ambitious
	enough to write your own modeller) you can link your program to the 
	libribout.a library.  Your application would use then be using the
	C binding to the RenderMan API.  This API
	is described in limited detail in the poets.ps document in the
	distribution.  A much better description can be found in Steve Upstill's
	<I>The RenderMan Companion</I>, published by Addison-Wesley.
	Developer's who write applications that use the RenderMan API will also
	need to include the ri.h header file in their source code.

	<H3>libsoargs.a, so.h - argument parser for compiled shaders</H3>
	According to Larry's documenation (which is all I have to go by - I've
	never seen the <I>PRMan</I> application myself), Pixar's <I>PRMan</I> 
	distribution
	also comes with a linkable library for parsing compiled shaders, much
	like the sotell program does in the BMRT distribution.  Since the
	compiled versions of the shaders differ in format Larry has provided
	a similar library for use by applications that need to parse his 
	version of the compiled shader files.  Applications which need this
	feature should include the so.h header file in their source code and
	link against the libsoargs.a library.

<HR width="90%">
<A NAME="examples"></A>
<H2>4. The Example Scenes</H2>
There are 8 example scenes in the distribution.  These are described in the
README file in the examples directory, but for completeness sake
I'll list and describe them briefly here.  The 8 RIB files are:
<UL>
	<LI>cornbox.rib - a simple radiosity test scene
	<LI>disptest.rib - an example of the use of complex procedural textures
	<LI>dresser.rib - raytracing combined with radiosity, showing light
			rays bouncing off of mirrors
	<LI>limbo.rib - very cool animation of Luxo Learning to Limbo
	<LI>shadtest.rib - shows shadows using lighting instead of shadow maps
	<LI>smokebox.rib - example of atmospheric effects using volume shaders 
	<LI>teapots.rib - familiar teapot example using raytracing to show
			reflections and refractions.
	<LI>tpdisp.rib  - more complex procedural textures
</UL>

Some of these are good examples for learning the syntax and structure of a
RIB file, others are not.  If you want to learn a little about the RIB
ASCII binding you should start by taking a look at the following examples:
<UL>
	<LI>cornbox.rib - probably the most commented of the examples.
	<LI>disptest.rib - short header comment and the file is well
			formatted making it fairly easy to follow.  Also a fairly short
			example so its easy to look up and learn the commands if you
			use the RenderMan Specification as a reference.
	<LI>shadtest.rib - good header comment, formatted; no other comments
</UL>

The rest of the RIB examples are not well formatted (probably output from 
a modeller or a program linked with libribout.a).  You really wouldn't 
want to examine the RIB file
in these cases anyway, as their main purpose is to show features of the
Shading Language.  In these cases you should take a look at the shaders
which they use.  You'll have to look in the RIB to learn which shaders are
important for a given example, however.  For example, the tpdisp.rib file
is an example of displacement shaders so you would look for the
Displacement commands in the RIB file to find which displacement shader
source files to examine.

<BR clear=both>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In order to explain how to use these tools in more detail I'll be using two
examples in each of the rest of the sections of this article.  In some
cases I'll use examples I found in the 
<A HREF="#rend-companion">RenderMan Companion</A>.
In other
cases I'll use some of Larry's examples or some of my own extremely
primitive examples.  They aren't very good - but this article was is as
much a learning experience for me as it is anyone else.

<HR width="90%">
<A NAME="rib"></A>
<H2>5. The Input File - RIB Format</H2>
	<H3> What is it?</H3>

	RIB stands for the RenderMan Interface Bytestream.  It comes in both
	ASCII and binary encodings.  We'll only be discussing the ASCII
	version since I have very little information about the binary encodings
	and BMRT doesn't come with any binary examples.  All the example RIB
	files are ASCII formatted.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	A RIB file is nothing more than an ASCII text file made up of a series
	of RIB commands.  These commands match their RenderMan API C function 
	counterparts almost exactly (there a few exceptions according to the official
	specification).  When you write a C program that
	makes calls to the RenderMan API via the libribout.a library 
	what you get as output 
	is the ASCII encoding of RIB.   This is why its generally easier to use
	the C binding for RenderMan than to write your own ASCII RIB file.

	<H3> A little about the format</H3>
		The semantics of the two bindings (C and ASCII RIB) are very similar.
	Both take token/value pairs as arguments.  The C binding requires that
	paremeter lists to functions be NULL terminated.  The ASCII RIB format
	does not.  The names of the C procedures are prefixed with <B>Ri</B> 
	but the equivalent RIB commands are not.  
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	RIB files Support single or multiple frames of an image, allowing
	(as in the limbo.rib example) animations with a single scene
	description.  This is a good case for using the procedural interface
	to RenderMan instead of hand coding the RIB file.  Its much easier
	to compute the scene descriptions through a programmed loop than
	to hand compute each frame using the ASCII RIB commands.

	<H3> How can you create RIB files?</H3>
	There are three ways to create a RIB file for use as input to one 
	of BMRT's renderers:
	<OL>
		<LI> By hand
		<LI> Write a C program using the RenderMan API and link
			with libribout.a
		<LI> Using a modeller
			<BR>
			There are three modellers currently available for Linux
			that can output RIB formatted files:
			<UL>
				<LI> SCED - a constraint based modeller, with a quite 
						useful CSG (constructive solid geometry) feature,
						 that uses an Athena Widget interface
				<LI> AC3D - a polygon based modeller with an easy to use
						3D (Motif-looking) interface
				<LI> AMAPI - an OpenGL based modeller
			</UL>
	</OL>
	My impression is that few people create RIB files by hand except as
	examples in order to test shaders or something similar.  The use
	of modellers on Linux is fairly new to the general public, so at this
	point I'm guessing many models are created by writing scene-specific
	programs linked with the libribout.a library.  Note that 
	developmental support for AC3D is ongoing, while AMAPI is reported
	to have dropped their Linux ports.  SCED's status is unknown at this
	time.  I've not seen any updates to it for about a year.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Lets take a look at a couple of examples.  The first is a simple
	RIB file from Larry's set of examples.  The second is a 
	simple animation in C source taken from the RenderMan Companion.

	<H3> Working example 1a - A sample RIB file</H3>
	The simplest example from the BMRT distribution to follow is 
	probably shadtest.rib.  It contains 3 textured objects (two spheres
	and a flat plane beneath them) along with a light source.  The source is 
	given in Listing 1.

	Items of interest in this file include:
	<OL>
		<LI>The values set before the WorldBegin command are used to 
		set camera and display parameters.  These global parameters are known as 
		<I>options</I>.  The display options can be specific to the renderer being
		used.  Rendering options cannot be set inside
		the WorldBegin/WorldEnd commands.
		<LI>Values set inside the Attribute commands are referred to as
		current parameters and are object specific parameters such as
		lighting, opacity and surface colors and textures.
		<LI>Objects (including lights) created inside the WorldBegin/WorldEnd
		commands exist only inside those commands.  They are not referencable
		outside of these commands.
		<LI>Notice how the RIB commands contain series of literal strings 
		and numeric values.  For example, the surface command is followed
		by the name of the surface (a string) followed by a series of 
		token/value pairs.  These tokens are variables known to the shader
		being called and the values are the ones we wish to set these 
		variables to when the shader is invoked.
		<LI>The # sign is a comment, but the double # (ie ##) is a 
		hint to the specific renderer.  For all practical
		purposes, these are also comments, since no renderers use them for
		anything.                                          
		I believe the format of the hint tag has changed for the 2.3.5 version
		of the BMRT renderers but I don't know what has replaced it.
		<LI>The commands to create the spheres are obvious.  The command
		to create the plane is "polygon".  The RenderMan API and BMRT 
		provide support for a number of primitive shapes.  BMRT also supports
		the ability to combine primitive shapes into more complex ones
		using what is known as Constructive Solid Geometry.
		<LI>The WorldEnd() command causes the scene to be output to the
		display.
		<LI>RIB commands may span multiple lines, although it doesn't
		show this in the example.
	</OL>
	I removed the comment at the start of the file just to save a little
	space.  You should read it and try rendering this example to get
	a feel for what it does.  All I really wanted to do with this example
	is show you what an ASCII RIB file looks like.  The format of the file
	gives a little clue as to the hierarchy of the commands:  WorldBegin/End
	encompass the Attribute commands, which in turn encompass some objects
	and their textures and other descriptions.  Understanding this 
	hierarchy can help you see the scope of definitions such as objects 
	or projections.  This hierarchy can be more 
	apparent when using the RenderMan API since the code is written in 
	a structured language, C.

	<H3> Working example 2a- A simple animation in C</H3>
	The RenderMan Companion by Steve Upstill contains a fair amount
	of sample code that uses the C binding to the RenderMan Interface.
	Lets take a look at the <A HREF="./source/example-1b.c">source</A>
	for one of these examples:
	<HR width=75%>

	<FONT size=2>

#include <ri.h>"
#define NFRAMES    10    /* number of frames in the animation */
#define NCUBES     5     /* # of minicubes on a side of the color cube */
#define FRAMEROT   5.0   /* # of degress to rotate cube between frames */

main()
{
   int frame;
   float scale;
   char   filename[20];

   RiBegin(RI_NULL);      /* Start the renderer */

      RiLightSource("distantlight", RI_NULL);

      /* Viewing transformation */
      RiProjection("perspective", RI_NULL);
      RiTranslate(0.0, 0.0, 1.5);
      RiRotate(40.0, -1.0, 1.0, 0.0);

      for (frame = 1; frame <= NFRAMES; frame++)
      {
			sprintf(filename, "anim%d.pic", frame);
         RiFrameBegin(frame);
            RiDisplay(filename, RI_FILE, RI_RGBA, RI_NULL);

	As you can see the hierarchy of commands is a little more evident.
	Of course, being an animation this is a more complex example.  A 
	distant light source is defined outside all frames of the animation.
	The type of camera projection is defined along with the initial
	viewing transformation.  This is followed by the main loop which
	produces the frames of the animation.  
	
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Inside the loop each frame is defined.  The display is set to
	write to a file and the format of the output is set with RI_RGBA,
	meaning red, green, blue and alpha channels will be output (or
	in simpler terms 3 colors and 1 opacity level).  How this is done
	is renderer specific.
	
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	This particular example is simplified by the use of an external 
	routine, ColorCube(), which actually defines the object geometry
	to be used.  In this case a cube is being built by ColorCube()
	with its sides being colored.  I left this routine as
	an exercise for the reader, mostly because I always wanted to 
	say that to someone.  For those who can't wait to figure out
	how to do it themselves, the code for ColorCube() is provided 
	in the RenderMan Companion.  

<HR width="90%">
<A NAME="basic-steps"></A>
<H2>6. Basic Steps</H2>
	So now we've seen what a RIB file looks like and how they can
	be created.  We know we need a RIB file as input to the renderers
	provided in the BMRT distribution.  We know that RIB files
	provide the geometry of a scene or set of frames and that shaders
	are referenced by the RIB files to provide texturing aspects to
	objects in those scenes.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Ok, so now what do we do?  Well, lets run through a full example
	of creating, shading, previewing, and final rendering of a single
	scene.  

	<H3>Create the RIB file</H3>
	Here is a 
	<A HREF="./source/example-2a.c">
	simple example</A>
	I created on my own.  It is C source that
	links with the libribout.a library.  When run it produces a RIB file
	of a scene with a blue ball over a gray plane, lit by a single
	distant light source.  The source is commented so you can see 
	exactly what I did to create this scene.  The C source is in 
	the same directory as the examples (or any directory directly under
	the main directory of the distribution).
	To compile this program you would use the following command:
	<CENTER>
	<table>
		<tr><td>
			<FONT size=2><B>
			gcc -o example-2a -O example-2a.c -I../include ../lib/libribout.a
			</B></FONT>
	</table>
	</CENTER>
	To run the command simply type
	<CENTER>
	<table>
		<tr><td>
			<FONT size=2><B>
			example-2a > example-2a.rib
			</B></FONT>
	</table>
	</CENTER>
	At this point you have the ASCII RIB input file needed to feed to one
	of the rendering programs.

	<H3>Preview the scene with rendribv and rgl</H3>
	The first thing to do is examime the scene as a wireframe display
	to make sure all our objects are there.  We won't really be able to
	tell if they are aligned properly (in front of or next to each 
	other) but we'll be able to see if they have the correct basic shape and
	if they are within the field of view.
	To preview the scene use the following command:
	<FONT size=2><B>
	rendribv example-2a.rib
	</B></FONT>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td valign=top rowspan=2>
				OK, everything looks as it should.  We've got a sphere and a plane.
				Lets add some surfaces to the objects using rgl.  The sphere 
				should be a solid blue and the plane should be grayish.
				<BR clear=both>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				To preview the scene with rgl use the following command:
				<BR clear=both>
				<FONT size=2><B>

				Again, this is about right.  The image you're looking at isn't great

				dark.  But lets see what we get from the high quality renderer.

	<table>
		<tr>
			<td valign=top rowspan=2>
				Oh oh.  The ball is well lit on top, but the plane is 
				gone.  Maybe it has someting to do with lighting.
				<H3>Adjusting the lighting</H3>
				In the sample source I set a distant light that
				sat on a line that stretches from
				&lt0.0, 10.5, -6.0&gt to &lt0.0, 0.0, 0.0&gt.
				This is allowing light to fall on only the top half 
				of the ball, but doesn't explain why the plane isn't
				visible.  Thats a different problem.

				The sample scene C source contains the following lines:
				<BR><FONT size=2>
					RiLightSource(RI_DISTANTLIGHT, RI_INTENSITY, 
					<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
					&intensity, RI_FROM, (RtPointer)from, 
					<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
					RI_TO, (RtPointer)to, RI_NULL);
					</FONT>

		<tr>
			<td align=center>
				<FONT size=2>
				<B>Figure 4:</B> output from rendrib
				</FONT>
	</table>

	The variables <I>from</I> and <I>to</I> define the line on which
	the distant light exists.  To make this light shine more on the front
	of the ball we can move the to point out to -600 on the Z axis.  
	This lights up the ball much better, but the plane is still invisible.
	We can also increase the value of the <I>intensity</I> 
	variable from 0.6 to 1.0.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	But whats wrong with the plane?  Where did it go?  The answer lies 
	in the surface texture used.

	<H3>Test with standard shaders</H3>
	The original version of the sample scene used a <I>matte</I>
	surface shader for the plane.  When rendered with the single distant
	light the reflectivity of the surface made it basically invisible 
	from the angle of view that we had set with our initial translation.  
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td valign=top rowspan=2>
				A first guess was to try adding a spotlight above 
				the surface, which can be seen in the 
				<A HREF="./source/example-3a.c">updated version of the 
				sample source</A>.
				This had no effect, so I tried another shader - the same matte 
				shader used on the sphere.  Viola!  The surface shows up, 
				including the newly added spotlight.  Way cool.

			Lets look at two more examples:

				<LI>Another plain sphere over a plane with a back wall
				<LI>Same scene with textured surfaces
			</UL>

			The RIB file for 
			<A HREF="./source/example-4a.rib">

			is probably more simplistic than the example-2a
			but with better results.  The difference is the use of
			well placed spotlights.  Notice the way the spotlight is

			&nbsp;&nbsp;
			LightSource "spotlight" 1 "from" [1 3 -4] 
			<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				"to" [0 0 0] "intensity" 15 
			</B></FONT>
			<BR>
			This is just like the distant light used in example-2a.
			This time two lights are used, and they are spotlights 
			instead of a distant light.  The effect of well placed
			spotlight shows in the realism of this image.

			The next image is a little hard to see.  I didn't have
			time to adjust the brightness (well I tried using xv
			but it kinda mucked up the image and I didn't have time
			to rerender Paul's RIB file).  What it shows is the same
			scene as Figure 6 except this time textures have been 
			applied to the sphere, the wall and the floor.  The 
			texture on the sphere is a glass stucco.  The floor has
			a wood texture and the wall has a wallpaper effect.
			The sphere is interesting in that it uses a glass surface
			shader with a stucco displacement map.  The displacement
			map alters the actual shape of the sphere causing
			the slightly bumpy effect that is (somewhat) visible in Figure 7.
			All of the textures are apparent from examination of the
			<A HREF="./source/example-4b.rib">RIB file</A>.
			All of the shaders used in this example are available

			of the image.  (Thats also something I always wanted to

	At this point there are only two things left to do:
	<UL>
		<LI>Write scene specific shaders
		<LI>Render final version
	</UL>
	Simple enough.  Except the first one of these will take up an entirely
	seperate article.  Next we'll introduce you to what shaders are without 
	going into depth on how to write them.
	Stay tuned next month when we'll cover how to write shaders.  


<HR width="90%">
<A NAME="shaders"></A>
<H2>7. Shaders</H2>
	<H3> What exactly is a shader?</H3>
	According to to the RenderMan Companion,
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		A shader is the
		part of the rendering program that calculates the appearance
		of visible surfaces in the scene.  In RenderMan, a shader
		is a procedure written in the RenderMan Shading Language
		used to compute a value or set of values (e.g., the
		color of the surface) needed during rendering.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	In my language:  a shader puts the surface on an object.

	<H3> How does it fit into a RIB?</H3>
	The shaders are external procedures referenced at rendering time
	by the rendering engine (in BMRT that would be <I>rendrib</I>).  
	The C binding to RenderMan calls a shader with the <I>RiSurface</I>
	call.  The following lines in the sample source used in the previous
	section apply the matte surface shader to the sphere and plane:
	<CENTER>
	<FONT size=2><B>
		RiSurface("matte", RI_NULL); 
	</B></FONT>.  
	</CENTER>
	This causes the following line to be added to the 
	ASCII RIB file output by the program when it is linked with libribout.a:
	<CENTER>
	<FONT size=2><B>
		Surface "matte"
	</B></FONT>.
	</CENTER>
	Obviously things can get much more complex than this.  But at least
	you'll have some way of identifying the shaders in the example 
	scene files.


	<H3> Compiling a shader</H3>
	You should keep in mind that the shaders you write in the
	RenderMan Shading Language have to be compiled before they can 
	be used.  Compiling shaders is very straightforward.  To compile
	the matte.sl shader into the matte.so file you would use a line
	like:
	<CENTER>
	<FONT size=2><B>
		slc matte.sl
	</B></FONT>.
	</CENTER>

<HR width="90%">
<A NAME="closing"></A>
<H2>7. Closing</H2>
	There aren't that many resource devoted to BMRT or RenderMan on the
	net just yet.  Most can be found by starting at 
	<A HREF="http://pete.cs.caltech.edu/RMR/index.html">
	The RenderMan Repository</A> -
	(http://pete.cs.caltech.edu/RMR/index.html).

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	So, thats about it.  You've seen the basics.  You've been introduced to the
	tools.  Now you just have to do something with them.  Larry's 
	<A HREF="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html">
	BMRT Web</A>
	pages contain links to intersting images created with BMRT.  That should
	provide some motivation.  I'll be playing with it all next month trying
	to learn about the RenderMan Shading Language for the April Graphics Muse
	column.  If you come up with anything interesting feel free to drop me a
	note.

<P> <HR> <P>  

It all started when the system rebooted...
<P> 
I had been having reliability problems with my system for over a
month. It would run fine for up to a week or so then it would crash
with wierd symptoms. I know it's unusual to trust in your software
these days, but I had faith that Linux was not the culprit. Only
operating systems produced by large companies have to be rebooted
every day.
<P> 
I took the motherboard out of the system and drove down to the
supplier. The guy behind the counter had the standard "electronic
supplier salesperson disease". He thought I was A. an idiot, B. trying
to rip him off or C. trying to ruin his day/profit margin. I explained
the problem, told him how it gave different symptoms each time it
died, and how I had swapped out parts. After about 20 minutes he had
no more arguments and he gave me a new motherboard.
<P> 
I took it home and put it back into the case. I was back up in a few
minutes and I put the system back into service. After almost three
weeks of blissfull operation it rebooted itself and started back up
without a problem. I didn't even know about it until I saw the system
log file a day later. ARGGG! The **** thing is broken again...
<P> 
I studied the logs and found that odd things had happened. The web
server process log was filled with total nonsense. The system log had
stopped working shortly after the reboot. I felt that a power failure
had caused the odd log messages and possibly damaged the system
logging program.
<P> 
As I began looking at the other logs I found that someone had
transferred copies of some of my files to a system I had never heard
of before. This was serious! I had been violated! I didn't have
hardware problems, some sleazoid-weasel had broken into my system! I
had previously been over the system carefully trying to eliminate all
the security holes. I hadn't been careful enough!
<P> 
I copied off every log file I could find and immediately changed all
the passwords on the system. If they had gotten in and copied the
password file they could eventually crack the encoding on their own
system and they would have all the passwords.
<P> 
I sent off a message to the system administrator of the system that
the files had been sent to. With a little time at a search engine site
I found that this system was located in Chicago. I later found out
from the site's system administrator that this guy had somehow broken
through the security in one of their systems routers. Once into the
router he installed a packet sniffer. This program reads the data
packets that go across the net and records anything that looks like a
password.
<P> 
I had been connecting to my system remotely to get mail from it. I
have since found out that the POP3 protocol used to get mail sends
your account password in clear text (unencrypted) when getting your
mail. This sleazy booger's packet sniffer probably captured my
password when I was getting my mail. The rlogin, rsh, rexec, rlp,
telnet, adn FTP protocols also send passwords in clear text by the
way!
<P> 
I went through the '/etc/services' file one more time and found that I
had not disabled the 'rlogin' service as I had first thought. This
service runs on port 513 but is not called 'rlogin'. I went through
and disabled every service that starts with an 'r'. These are the
remote services programs that a cracker can use to get into your
system. I disabled all file sharing and all protocols except tcp/ip. I
disabled the telnet service altogether since there is a better
replacement. I also made sure that NFS and RPC were disabled since
there was supposed to be a security hole in these too.
<P> 
Well, not a lot had been done to my system, other than the reboot
after the break-in. One nagging thing was that the system logging no
longer worked. After goofing around with it for a day or so I finally
noticed what should have been obvious. The 'syslogd' program had been
replaced with another program with the same name.
<P> 
I haven't verified it but I believe this program is another copy of
the packet sniffer the cracker used in the router. When you do a 'ps'
to see what's running you wouldn't think anything about it since this
program should be running all the time. I replaced the 'syslogd'
program with the correct one and it worked like a champ again.
<P> 
While poking around in my /tmp directory I found a copy of the 'bash'
shell with the SUID bit set. WHOA! What's this? With this little baby
you can become root by simply running it. When I happened to mention
this to a fine gentleman [Jim Dennis, The Answer Guy --Editor]
who was helping me try to get it working he
immediately remembered the security hole associated with this. There's
a bug with the 'sendmail' program that allows you to make an SUID copy
of your shell in the /tmp directory. If you don't have version 8.8.3
or later of the sendmail program you're vulnerable too! (go to
http://www.sendmail.org for the latest stuff).
<P> 
So, what have I learned from all this?
<ol>
<li>Security is more important than I thought.
<li>Security is no fun to implement...
<li>Cracker's read the CERT releases so they can keep up on
    the latest, coolest, ways to break into your system. They
    think it's a fun challenge to 'beat you'
<li>Security is no fun to implement...
<li>Don't use FTP, telnet, rlogin, rsh, or POP3 remotely. If
    you need to do this get the newer versions that encrypt
    the session BEFORE they log in.
<li>Security is no fun to implement...
<li>If you have an older version of sendmail than 8.8.3 replace it. 8.
<li>Don't give access to programmers tools. It just makes
    the cracker's job easier.
<li>Security is no fun to implement...
<li>Turn off all remote services on your system
<li>Security is no fun to implement...
<li>Read the CERT bulletins to see if you have any obvious holes
   in your system. If you do, fix them
</ol>
and lastly... <BR> 
  Security is no fun to implement!
<P> 
best of luck to you!

<h2>Linux and MIDI: In the beginning...</h2>
<H4>By Dave Phillips,

<P> <HR><P> 
  "<i>The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol has been variously
described as an interconnection scheme between instruments and computers, a set of
guidelines for transferring data from one instrument to another, and a language for
transmitting  musical scores between computers and synthesizers. All these definitions
capture an aspect of MIDI.</i>"
                &lt;Roads, Curtis. 1995. 
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/mitp/recent-books/comp/roads.html">
Computer Music Tutorial</a>. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. p. 972&gt;
<br>
<p>
  Greetings! This article will hopefully be the first in a series covering various
aspects of <a href="http://www.midi-classics.com/whatmidi.htm">MIDI</a> and sound with Linux. The series will be far from exhaustive, and
I sincerely hope to hear from anyone currently using and/or developing MIDI and
audio software for use under Linux.<p>
  Perhaps most Linux users know about MIDI as a soundcard interface option, or as
a standalone interface option during kernel configuration for sound. As usual, some
preparatory considerations must be made in order to optimally set up your Linux
MIDI music machine. Be sure to read the kernel configuration notes included in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation: you will find basic information about setting up your
soundcard and/or interface, and you will also find notes regarding changes and
additions to the sound driver software.<p>
  Common soundcards such as the <a href="http://www.creativelabs.com/">SoundBlaster16</a> or the MediaVision 
<a href="http://www.mediavis.com/mainmenu.htm">PAS16</a> require
a separate MIDI connector kit to provide the MIDI In/Out ports, while standalone
interface cards such as the <a href="http://www.rolandcorp.com">Roland MPU-401</a> and
<a href="http://www.opcode.com">Music Quest MQX32M</a> have the ports
built-in. Dedicated MIDI interface cards don't usually have synthesis chips (such
as the <a href="http://www.yamaha.com">Yamaha</a> OPL3 FM synthesizer) on-board, but they often provide services not usually
found on the soundcards, such as MTC or SMPTE time code and multi-port systems (for
expanding available channels past the original limit of 16).<p>
  Having successfully installed your card and kernel (or module) support, you will
still need a decent audio system and a MIDI input device. If you use a soundcard for
MIDI record/play via the internal chip, you will also need a software mixer; if you
record your MIDI output to tape, and then record your tape to your hard-disk, you
will also want a soundfile editor.<p>
  When the essential hardware and software is properly configured, it's time to look
at the available software for making music with MIDI and Linux. Please note that in this
article I will only supply links and very brief descriptions, while further articles
will delve deeper into the software and its uses.<p>
  Nathan Laredo's <a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/midi/">playmidi</a> is a simple command-line utility for MIDI playback and
recording which can also be compiled for ncurses and X interfaces.
<a href="http://rokke.grm.hia.no/per/jazz.html">JAZZ</a> is an excellent sequencer which has some unique MIDI-processing features and
an
interface which will feel quite familiar to users of Macintosh and Windows sequencers. 
<a href="http://www.calband.berkeley.edu/~gmeeker/vivace/">Vivace</a>
and <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/rose.html">Rosegarden</a> are notation packages which provide score playback, but each with a
difference: Rosegarden accesses your MIDI configuration, while Vivace "renders"
the score. <a href="http://www.clinet.fi/~toivonen/timidity/">tiMiDity</a> is a rendering program which compiles a MIDI file into
a soundfile, using patch sets or WAV files as sound sources. Ruediger Borrmann's 
<a href="http://www.inx.de/%7Erubo/songlab/midi2cs/csound.html#top">MIDI2CS</a> is also a
rendering program, but it acts as a translator from a MIDI file to a
<a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/Man/c_front.html">Csound </a> score file.
Mike Durian's <a href="http://jagger.me.berkeley.edu/~greg/tclmidi.html">tclmidi</a> and 
<a href="http://jagger.me.berkeley.edu/~greg/tclmidi.html">tkseq </a>provide a powerful MIDI programming
environment, and Tim Thompson has recently announced the availability of his
<a href="http://www.nosuch.com/keykit/index.html">KeyKit</a>,
a very interesting GUI for algorithmic MIDI composition.<p>
  4-track recording to hard disk can be realized using Boris Nagels' 
<a href="http://rulhmpc38.leidenuniv.nl/private/multitrack/multitrack.html">Multitrack</a>, but
Linux has yet to see an integrated MIDI/audio sequencer such as Opcode's 
<a href="http://www.opcode.com">Studio Vision</a> for the Mac
or Voyetra's <a href="http://www.voyetra.coma/">Digital Orchestrator Plus</a> for Windows. Linux also lacks device support for the
digital I/O cards such as the <a href="http://www.zefiro.comi"/>Zefiro</a> or
DAL's <a href="http://www.digitalaudio.com/">Digital-only</a>.<p>
  If you use the tiMiDity package or MIDI2CS you will want to edit your
sample
libraries.
Available soundfile editors include the remarkable <a href="http://www.ccmrc.ucsb.edu/~doug/htmls/MixViews.html">MiXViews</a>, the Ceres <a href="http://www.ceressoft.com>SoundStudio</a>,
and Paul Sharpe's tk-based <a
href="http://www.elec-eng.leeds.alc.uk/staff/een6njb/Software/Studio/screens.html">
Studio</a>.<p>
  The excellent <a href="http://www.digiserve.com/ar/linux-snd/">Linux MIDI & Sound Pages</a> are the best starting point in your search
for software, and be sure to check the <a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/Incoming">Incoming</a> directory at 
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/">sunsite</a>. Newsgroups
dedicated to MIDI include <a href="news:comp.music.midi">comp.music.midi</a> and 
<a href="news:alt.binaries.sounds.midi">alt.binaries.sounds.midi</a>; please write to me if you know what
mail-lists are available, I'll list them in a later article.<p>
  Feel free to write concerning corrections, addenda, or comments to this article.
Linux has great potential as a sound-production platform, and we can all contribute
to its development. I look forward to hearing from you!

<center><h1>Amaya</h1></center>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<center><h4><a href="mailto: layers@vax2.rainis.net">by Larry
Ayers</a></h4></center>

<P> <HR> 
<!--===================================================================-->
<p>For several years a group of programmers in France have been developing
an elaborate text-processing system known as Thot.  Thot has some
resemblances to Tex, in that it is a structural document-editing system
capable of very high-quality output.  One major difference is that Thot is
more WYSIWYG; the formatting tagging is hidden and doesn't have to be
explicitly written by the user.  The output formats are more varied as well.
Thot can produce Postscript files, as Tex can, but it can also produce plain
ASCII text and HTML.

This last formatting capability attracted the attention of the W3
Consortium a couple of years ago.  (W3 is an international research
organization which attempts to set standards for Internet documents; their
flexibility and patience have been sorely tried in recent years by the flood
of HTML innovations introduced by Microsoft and Netscape, among others).
Using the Thot system as a core, the W3 group in collaboration with the Thot
developers have been developing a combined web-browser and HTML editor known
as Amaya.

<center><h3>Source and Installation</h3></center>

<p>Amaya, as is the case with much Linux software, is a work-in-progress.
Until recently the source code was restricted to members of the W3
Consortium and only binary versions were available to the public.  In early
February the source was made freely available, both at the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/amaya ">Amaya web-site</a> and also at the
Sunsite archive site, currently in the <i>/pub/Linux/Incoming</i> directory.

<p>Amaya can be installed anywhere as long as the directory structure is
preserved.  It is a Motif application, so unless you have the Motif
libraries and header files installed you will have to get the
statically-linked binary distribution.  Compiling the source necessitates
obtaining and compiling the Thot toolkit as well, which is available from
the same locations as Amaya.  I compiled it from source and found the
instructions to be somewhat unclear; after several false starts I found that
the Thot source should be unarchived first, then the Amaya source should be
unarchived so that the Amaya directory is a subdirectory of the top-level
Thot directory.  This is a very large source tree and needs about sixty
megabytes of free disk-space over and above that required for the source
itself. It compiled without errors but there was no evident means provided
for cleaning up the object files, etc.  I resorted to moving subdirectories
which looked un-essential to another drive, then moving back the essential
ones which it turned out Amaya needs.  You might want to try the binary
version first in order to determine if it suits you before going to the
trouble of obtaining and compiling the source. 

<p>One caution: the first time you start Amaya, point it at a local file;
otherwise it will attempt to load a file from http://www.w3.org and if
you're not on-line at the time, it will die with a segmentation fault.  The
default home-page can be set to one on your local disk in the
initialization file if you'd like. 

<center><h3>Editing and Browsing With Amaya</h3></center>

<p>As an HTML editor Amaya is WYSIWYG all the way.  There is no view of the
file being edited which shows the actual HTML tags.  The main window
<a href="../gx/ayers/amaya_main.gif">(take a look!)</a> is a typical browser
window complete with in-line graphics, with the major difference being that
you can enter text.  The various HTML tags are invisibly inserted by means
of mouse-driven menus.  I much prefer hot-keys and found that, though few
are included by default, any number of them can be set up in the
<i>~/.thotrc</i> file. The behaviour of the <kbd>enter</kbd> key is
interesting.  Pressing the key while just typing text will start a new
paragraph, whereas if you are entering list-items, table-fields or other
sequential tags another one is created.

<p>There are two alternative file views available: the first is the
"Structure View" <a href="../gx/ayers/amaya_struc.gif"> (here's a
screenshot)</a> which presents a tree-like diagram of the HTML file.  I
suppose this could be useful with large files, just to get an overview.
Another window, the "Alternate View"
<a href="../gx/ayers/amaya_alt.gif">(another screenshot)</a>, shows you what
your file will look like when displayed by a text-mode browser such as Lynx.
I thought this was a nice touch. It's all too easy to work up an HTML file,
test it with Netscape or Mosaic, and never even consider that it may be
illegible viewed with a text-mode browser.

<p>As a web-browser Amaya has some limitations.  It is confused by many of
the newer Netscape tags, though on relatively simple pages it does a good
job.  As an example, the Linux Gazette table-of-contents page is displayed
in a garbled fashion.  The spiral-notebook graphic on the left side of the
page isn't rendered, and the table formatting isn't interpreted
correctly.  In contrast, the bulk of LG's content pages display well, but
they are usually simpler in format.

<p>Amaya wasn't really created to be a full-fledged browser, though it may
approach that status in future releases.  The W3 "position statement" on
Amaya says that it is intended to be a test-bed platform for HTML
development.

<p>I never have become comfortable using Amaya, or any WYSIWYG HTML editor
for that matter, to create HTML files from scratch.  What I have been using
it for is to experiment with already-written files.  Sometimes when the
precise tagging I want eludes me, I've loaded the file into Amaya just to
see how it approaches the problem.  It might be wise to begin using Amaya on
copies of files.  I favor lower-case tagging but when Amaya saves a file it
will replace all of the tagging with its own, and this is all uppercase.
Some of its other choices may not be what you want as well, so working with
a copy allows you to incorporate the changes you like into the original
file, leaving the rest alone.

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>Amaya is an interesting project, and even at this early stage it's stable
enough to be usable.  I wouldn't want to have to rely on it solely, but it
has proved useful to me on several occasions.  Now that the source has been
made public perhaps other programmers will make contributions; it's likely
that in future months new releases will be made, amd its capabilities will
increase.

<H1>Slrn and Slrnpull: Sucking Down The News</H1>
</center>

<center><h4><a href="mailto: layers@vax2.rainis.net">by Larry
Ayers</a></h4></center>

<P> <HR> 
<!--===================================================================-->
<p>
There are quite a few methods of reading Usenet postings.  A conventional
newsreader will log on to your remote server, download headers of the new
messages in groups you want to follow, then allow you to tag the messages you
want to read.  These messages are then fetched for you.  All of this happens
while online, and the time can mount up.</p>

<p>
Another approach is one used by Suck and Leafnode, among others.  These
programs are designed to be used non-interactively and usually are set up to
deposit fetched postings into a local spool-directory.  Suck requires that you
have an active news-server, such as INN or CNEWS, on your machine. Leafnode
doesn't need the news-server (it has its own), but both programs are designed
for multiple users and might be overkill for single-user machines.</p>

<p>
Slrn is a popular text-mode newsreader, written by <a href="mailto:
davis@space.mit.edu">John Davis</a> at MIT.  It originally belonged to the
first category above, but recently Davis has been working on an extension for
Slrn which will pull down messages from a server and store them locally.  The
messages can then be read offline with Slrn.  The extension is called
Slrnpull, and it comes with the most recent beta version of Slrn.</p>

<center><h3>Installation and Usage</h3></center>

<p> If you have the S-lang library on your system, you can compile Slrn and
Slrnpull from the source, which is available (along with the S-lang library
source) from <a href="ftp://space.mit.edu /pub/davis/slrn">this site.</a>
A binary, statically-linked version may be in the /pub/Linux/Incoming
directory at sunsite.unc.edu by the time you read this.  If you prefer a
certain location for the news-spool directory (which can get large) the
<i>slrnfeat.h</i> file in the /slrn/src directory can be edited.</p>

<p>
Slrn uses a <em>configure</em> script which should enable it to be compiled on
most Linux systems.  Once you've put the executables in a directory on your
path, create the spool directory (<i>/var/spool/news/slrnpull</i> or whatever
you've defined it to be), then copy the supplied sample script
<i>slrnpull.conf </i> to the new directory.  This needs to be edited before
you start Slrnpull for the first time. The format is not complicated; here are
John Davis' comments from the sample file:<br><code><pre>

# The syntax of the file is very simple.  
# Any line that is blank or begins with a '#' character will be ignored by 
# slrnpull.  The remaining lines consist of 1-3 fields separated by 
# whitespace:
#
#   NEWSGROUP_NAME  MAX_ARTICLES_TO_RETRIEVE   NUMBER_OF_DAYS_BEFORE_EXPIRE
#
# The first field must contain the name of a newsgroup.  
# 
# The second field denotes the number of articles to retrieve for the 
# newsgroup; if its value is 0, all available articles will
# be retrieved.
#
# The third field indicates the number of days after an article is retrieved
# before it will be eligible for deletion.  If this value is 0, articles from
# this group will not expire.
#
#
# If a field is blank, or contains the single character '*', default values
# will apply to the field.  Defaults may be set by a line whose newsgroup
# field is 'default'.  Such a line will denote default values to be applied to 
# the lines following it or until another default is established.

# For example:
default                                20        14
# indicates a default value of 20 articles to be retrieved from the server and
# that such an article will expire after 14 days.
comp.os.linux.misc        50        7
comp.os.linux.x         20        7
comp.os.linux.announce        *        *
</pre>
</code></p>

<p>
This is easier to set up than some news programs I've used!</p>

<p>
Assuming you have the $NNTPSERVER variable set to your news-server's IP
address in your <i>~/.bash_profile</i> or <i>~/.cshenv</i> file, Slrnpull
should be ready to try out.  The first time you start it up it will create a
subdirectory for each news-group you have specified.  Then it will log on to
your server and download messages, displaying the connection speed and number
of articles on your terminal screen.</p>

<p>
You probably subscribe to certain groups for which you want all of the new
messages.  For certain others you may want to be more selective in what you
download.  A kill-file can be created in the spool directory which specifies,
on a per-group basis, which messages you would prefer be left on the
server.</p>

<p>
Starting up Slrn with the switch <i>--spool</i> will cause it to load the
contents of your newly-filled spool-file.  Reading messages this way is fast,
and any which you delete will then be invisible in the newsreader, though they
remain on the disk until they are expired.  Any follow-up postings which you
might write are stored in a subdirectory of the spool.  The next time you run
Slrnpull it will upload them to the server before retrieving new messages.</p>

<p>
Slrnpull keeps a log of all transactions to the server; these messages are
displayed on the screen as the program runs, but the idea of this program is
that you don't need to be sitting there watching.  The log is useful for
checking to see if your postings have been accepted by the server.</p>

<p>
Periodically Slrnpull should be run with the <i>--expire</i> switch, which
will remove all messages you've marked for deletion while reading news with
Slrn.  This could be run every night as a cron job.</p>

<p>
It will take some fine-tuning of the <i>slrnpull.conf</i> file, but eventually
you will have the program retrieving just the messages you want. It might seem
like a waste to be downloading all of the junk messages along with the
worthwhile ones, but it's a continuous process and doesn't take long.  I've
found that running Slrnpull while browsing the web or receiving an FTP file
works well.</p>


<p>The sample <i>.slrnrc</i> file included with the program has an if/then
statement which causes Slrn to read the local active file when run in spool
mode, while keeping Slrn in standard mode from retrieving the bulky remote
active file each time a connection is made.  This lets you read news
directly from your server when desired.  

<p> The sample file includes some new entries in order for Slrn to make use
of the spooled messages.  These are:<br></p>

<pre>
<code></code>

      set spool_inn_root        "/var/spool/news/slrnpull"
      set spool_root                "/var/spool/news/slrnpull/news"
      set spool_nov_root        "/var/spool/news/slrnpull"
      set use_slrnpull 1
      hostname "your.host.name"
      username "your_user_name"

</pre>

<p>The remainder of the <i>.slrnrc</i> file is the same as in previous Slrn
versions, so if you already have one customized to your liking the
Slrnpull-specific sections can be lifted from the sample and pasted in.

<p>
I initially had some trouble convincing slrnpull to talk to my news-server.  I
asked John Davis for help and he sent me a patch for one source file which
caused slrnpull to generate a debugging log; from the logfile he determined
that the problem was with the proprietary Dnews server software which my
provider uses. The currently available version has this patch included.</p>
<p>

If you want to find out what software your news-server uses, just telnet into
the news machine:<br></p>
<pre>

    <i>telnet [IP address] :nntp</i>

</pre>

<p>
The server will identify itself when you log in.</p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>
Slrnpull is probably most useful with low-volume newsgroups, such as
<em>comp.os.linux.announce</em>.  You would most likely want to see all of the
messages anyway in such a group and Slrnpull will fetch them all.  High-volume
groups, such as <em>comp.os.linux.advocacy</em>, typically have a high
chaff-to-wheat ratio, and in these a quick scan of the headers for the few of
interest (while online) might be more efficient.  Slrnpull is also effective
for obtaining a quick idea of the the flavor and tone of a group: just tell
it to suck down the most recent twenty messages in the group, and see
what you think.  </p>

<p>If you have never used Slrn, I highly recommend this program, especially
if you read news over a PPP or SLIP connection.  It's fast and efficient,
and its behaviour can be easily molded to your needs.  Users of the Emacs
news interface Gnus will find the transition painless, as most of the
keystroke commands are identical.  Gnus has many more features but it's
slower to use over a network and is much more demanding of system resources.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Sigrot: BBS Taglines for the Net</H1>

<CENTER><P ALIGN=CENTER>By&nbsp;Paul Anderson, &lt;paul@geeky1.ebtech.net&gt;</P></CENTER>

<P> <HR> <P> 
<P>Have you ever called BBSes and downloaded QWK packets? If you have,
then you most likely will have either seen or used a tagline. For those
of you who haven't, a tagline is one line of text for a witty saying. It's
usually at the bottom of a persons signature. QWK packets, by the way,
are like UUCP for DOS in that you downloaded this zipped file with all
your mail in it, then you open it in a QWK mail reader, and upload your
replies. The QWK mail reader often supports the ability to change taglines
with each message. </P>

<P>These short witticisms are nice to have at the end of a message, and
sometimes they prove to be the best part! This brings me to the program
featured in this article. Sigrot is currently in version 1.0 and is maintained
by Christopher Morrone, &lt;<A HREF="mailto:cmorrone@udel.edu">cmorrone@udel.edu&gt;</A>.
It can be obtained from gilb5.gilb.udel.edu:/pub/linux/sigrot_v1.0.tar.gz
</P>

<P>Got the tar-file? Good. Untar it with: </P>

<PRE>tar -xzvf sigrot_v1.0.tar.gz
</PRE>

<P>Look in the current directory and you'll find a directory named sigrot_v1.0/
Change into that directory, read the README and INSTALL.help files, then
run make </P>

<PRE>geeky1,1:~/tar-stuff/sigrot_v1.0% make
done
geeky1,1:~/tar-stuff/sigrot_v1.0%
</PRE>

<P>You'll have a program named sigrot in the current directory, sigrot.1
is the manpage. Then you can test it: </P>

<PRE>geeky1,1:~/tar-stuff/sigrot_v1.0% sigrot -w testfile
testfile copied over signature archive.
Type &quot;sigrot -r&quot; to restore the previous archive.
geeky1,1:~/tar-stuff/sigrot_v1.0% sigrot
geeky1,1:~/tar-stuff/sigrot_v1.0%
</PRE>

<P>Well, what have we just done? We've put the signatures in testfile into
sigrot's signature archive, and we've just nuked your ~/.signature file.
Check it out and you'll see that it contains: </P>

<PRE>This is the first signature entry.
</PRE>

<P>Okay, so if we check testfile we see that the first line contains the
first signature. Let's run it again. Okay, what's in ~/.signature now?
Check it out and you'll see: </P>

<PRE>This is
       the
          second signature
                          entry.
                        
</PRE>

<P>So what good is this to me, you say? Plenty. Create a new file called
'mysigs' with couple of your favourite one-liners. Now we run our dear
friend sigrot again: </P>

<PRE>geeky1,1:~/tar-stuff/sigrot_v1.0% sigrot -w mysigs
</PRE>

<P>Okay, run sigrot with no command-line options and check ~/.signature.
Is one of the signatures from mysigs in ~/.signature? If so, put the following
in your crontab: </P>

<PRE>00 * * * *      sigrot
</PRE>

<P>That'll run sigrot once every hour. Now, you're ready to send e-mail
with your new cool .sig! </P>

<H3>Of prefixes and space reduction.</H3>

<P>Sometimes, when you've got .sig like mine, the majority of my .sig never
changes. If you get a significant number of one-liners in your signature
archive, it can became quite large. What a waste of space. But, wait! There's
a way to reduce the amount of space it takes! To show you what I mean,
Here's my .signature: </P>

    Manuals out, after all possible keystrokes have failed.

</PRE>

<P>Only the last line ever changes. Why waste disk space when you can use
a more efficient method? Here's what I've done, you see sigrot creates
a directory called ~/.sigrot, and it lets you specify a prefix. A prefix
is what's put before the .sigs from your .sig archive, it's used for stuff
that doesn't change. So, I created a file named ~/.sigrot/prefix, and put
the following in it: </P>

<H2>Thoughts on Multi-threading</H2>
<H4>By Andrew L. Sandoval,
<a href="mailto:sandoval@perigee.net">sandoval@perigee.net</a></H4>
</center>
<P> <HR> <P>  

<P>As I read the article &quot;What Is Multi-Threading?&quot; in
the February issue of LJ my mind went back a couple of months ago to the
time I decided it would be fun to write a multi-threaded FTP daemon
to replace the wu-ftpd we were using on a very heavily hit FTP server. 
As the author explains in his article, threads make a lot of sense for
server applications.  Just the memory savings on 250 copies of the
FTP daemon makes it all worth investigating.  BUT, just as you were
about to go out and make all of you favorite server applications multi-threaded,
I thought a couple of notes from my project might come in handy.

<P>First, if you plan on allowing a high number of concurrent connections
to your server, a single multi-threaded process will not do.  Most
OS's, Linux included limit the number of file descriptors a process is
allowed to have open at any one time.  You can usually use getrlimit()
and setrlimit() to give your process the maximum number of file descriptors
allowed, rather than the default (usually 64), but, even still most operating
system (NOFILE) hard limits are set to 1024.  In the case of an FTP
server you must keep in mind that you will need at least three file descriptors
for every client connection.  (1 for commands, 1 for file transfers,
and 1 to open the file or directory listing to transfer.)  This
quickly adds up.  Supporting 500 concurrent connections would require
an absolute minimum of 1500 descriptors, and that is not even counting
the ones you need just to get up and running (like the socket used to listen
for incoming connections.)  The best way I have found to solve
this problem is to fork() a predetermined number of child processes that
all accept file descriptors that are passed from the parent and then create
a thread to handle the incoming descriptor/connection.  On Linux you
would use the proc filesystem to pass the descriptor.  On other OS's
such as Solaris (that support Streams) you would use ioctl() with the I_SENDFD
and I_RECVFD functions.

<P>This has another advantage as well.  In addition to accepting
file descriptors from the parent process which is listening for connections
on port n, you can now receive connections from any process that chooses
to pass clients on to your multi-threaded server through a named pipe. 
A good example might be a small appliction that is started by inetd and
then decides (by say IP address) whether to pass your connection to
the multi-threaded server or to the standard ftpd.  (This was useful
in my case, since our ftpd was for anonymous FTP only.  The daemon
did not support any functions unneccesary for typical anonymous FTP such
as chmod or delete.  On the otherhand, we wanted employees of the
company to be able to do just that while still logging in as anonymous. 
So, if you came from an IP address that we knew was ours, the inetd
application exec()'d ftpd after clearing the close-on-exec flag. 
If you came from the outside world you went directly to the multi-threaded
FTP daemon which also limited your access beyond what the file system already
provided.)

<P>Just when you finally think you have out smarted the file descriptor
problem, here comes another one: fopen().  The standard i/o fuctions
like fopen(), fprintf(), fgets(), etc., are extremely useful when working
with a command driven application like FTP.  Unfortunately the fileno
element of the FILE struct is usually defined as an unsigned char. 
Simply put, once you have more than 255 open file descriptors in a single
process you can no longer reliably use fopen(), fprintf(), etc.  The
solution here: don't use these functions.  Instead use open(), read(),
write(), etc.  A possible second solution is to make sure you have
enough child processes accepting file descriptors to keep each process
from exceeding the 255 limit.

<P>If you choose to write such a multi-threaded server, you will also
have to deal with the possibility of concurrent threads in multiple processes
accessing a delicate resource.  (i.e. even something as simple as
a global count of the number of concurrent connections.)  In this
case you will still want to use a Mutex to protect data, but, the mutex
will need to mmap()'d by all child processes, so that a lock in thread
A in process 1 will also block thread C in process 2.  In the case
of a resource such as a &quot;current user count&quot; you will want that
variable to be included in the mmap()'ing anyway.

<P>Aside from all of this, threads really are fun.  Threaded applications
are a great deal more painful to debug, and given the OS and stdio limits
I have mentioned there may even be more programming overhead, but,
the trade off in system performance and resource utilization for major
client/server applications is worth it.  Besides, this is the stuff
that makes programming fun!

<P>I hope this is helpful.

<P>Andrew L. Sandoval

<H2>USENIX Notes</H2>
<H4>By Arnold D. Robbins,
<a href="mailto:arnold@skeeve.atl.ga.us">arnold@skeeve.atl.ga.us</a></H4>
</center>
<P> <HR> <P>  
Sun, 19 Jan 97 <BR> 
I am writing this on my Linux portable after USENIX.   I hadn't been
to USENIX in four years, and had been looking forward to it for a while.
Some things were really great, and others were disappointing. Overall,
I enjoyed it and it was worthwhile.
<P> 
I took two tutorials. The first was on Win32 programming, and it was most
of the justification for getting my company to pay for the conference, since
I'll be doing a lot of Windows NT programming starting soon after I return.
The tutorial was good, but the notes were not in sync with the slides, which
was very frustrating.
<P> 
The second tutorial, well, the less said about it the better; it was below
the usual standard for USENIX tutorials, which are usually quite good.
<P> 
Of course, the best part of the conference is the conference.  There are
several components: the refereed papers, the invited talks, the vendor
show, and then the general "networking" (not the computer and wires kind,
the other kind) that goes on.
<P> 
The refereed papers didn't seem that exciting.  They all either dealt with
enhancements to proprietary versions of Unix, or had WWW in their title. 
Of course, maybe when I get to read some of the papers, I'll revise my
opinion.
<P> 
The invited talks were better, particularly from the guys at Bell Labs;
Matt Blaze on why encryption isn't used more often, Rob Pike on Inferno
(they gave out an Inferno CD to all registrants) and Bill Cheswick's
"Stupid Net Tricks" talk.
<P> 
The vendor show was ok. O'Reilly, and especially the San Diego Technical
Bookstore did a bang-up business. All the Linux CD-ROM vendors were there
and did OK too. The biggest hit was SSC's t-shirt (see photos elsewhere),
which sold like hot cakes. Fortunately, I got mine early.
<P> 
This was the first joint USELINUX conference.  I must say, Linux is
certainly invigorating the USENIX community.  The Linux talks I went too
were all well attended. Dave Miller and Miguel de Icaza (sp?) gave a
neat talk on Linux/SPARC.  It doesn't yet support the Minix filesystem,
due to endian issues.  Most people in the room didn't seem to mind...
Otherwise, it's Linux, and it's cool.  You can get a real distribution
from Red Hat.
<P> 
It was particularly interesting that Linus's talk on the future of Linux
overflowed the smaller conference room into the very large main speaking
hall. The majority of the conference attendees were there. As always, I
found Linus amusing, intelligent, and very insightful about the computer /
desktop industry.  Linus's goal: World Domination. But to achieve this,
we need real end-user applications (spreadsheets, word processors, etc).
Linus made the insightful observation that the Unix vendors have made a
mistake concentrating on the market for the server in the back room; no-one
sees it, and no-one cares if it's replaced with something else.
<P> 
And last, but not least, the "networking" part.  Figuring that I probably
wouldn't get to another USENIX for a long time, I took advantage of the
opportunity to chat with Dennis Ritchie for a few minutes, and thank him
for the courtesy with which he always replies to my email. I enjoyed it;
he's a really neat person.
<P> 
I got to meet Jeffrey Friedl (author of O'Reilly's new book on regular
expressions); he had found a number of strange cases in gawk's behavior
(that have since been fixed).  I also finally met Larry Wall, author
of Perl.  Larry is one of the few people who generally doesn't wear a
name badge at USENIX; otherwise he wouldn't be able to move around much.
<P> 
I was there when Greg Wettstein (sp?) of the Roger Maris Cancer Center
came over, introduced himself to Larry, and told him that many cancer
patients were having an easier life thanks to Perl.  It was a humbling
experience, since I certainly haven't made that kind of an impact on
anything, and Larry too seemed a bit awed.  Larry's a neat guy; I hope
to get to know him better in the future.
<P> 
Conclusions: 1. It's worthwhile for Linux people to be involved in USENIX;
we're all on the same Open Systems / Free Software team, even if we don't
realize it.  2. Linux is invigorating USENIX, it's brought the fun back
into the Unix world.

<h1> What You Can Do with tcpd </h1>
<H4>By Kelly Spoon,
<a href="mailto:mars@loeffel.txdirect.net">mars@loeffel.txdirect.net</a></H4>
</center>
<P> <P>  
If you have read my article on security, then you know that <i>tcpd</i>
can be used to keep people from getting on your machine, and, thusly, 
it makes a nice first line defense against Bad Guys.  You also know that
there is an extra option you can put in the <i>/etc/hosts.allow</i> and
<i>/etc/hosts.deny</i> files that the man pages refer to as the
"shell_command".
<p>
So....are you wondering what all you can do with the "shell_command" option?
<p>
Me too.  According to the <b>hosts_access</b> man(5) page, you can use it
to finger the person who is trying to get to your services.  However, the
feature that I think is pretty neat is that this gives you the ability to
set up personalized banners for whenever someone tries to connect to your
machine.
<p>
Here's the catch, though.  In order to enable this option, you're going to 
need to recompile and turn this sucker on yourself.  The binaries that your
favorite Linux distribution installed on your machine probably weren't set
up to take advantage of this neat little feature.  (At least, they weren't
on mine)
<p>
<center>
<h2> Getting and installing tcpd </h2>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
The first thing you need to do is get a hold of is the source for <i>tcpd</i>.
<a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/net-source/base/tcp_wrappers_7.4.tar.gz">
Here</a> is where it's been hidden.
<p>
Those of you with keen eyes will note that the name of the file we have
downloaded is <i>tcp_wrappers*.tar.gz</i> and not <i>tcpd*.tar.gz</i>.  Don't
sweat it, this really is the package you want.
<p>
<kbd>tar -zxvf tcp_wrappers*.tar.gz</kbd> will unpack everything for you into
the <i>tcp_wrappers_7.4</i> directory.  It doesn't really matter where you do
this, since after we have compiled and installed the binaries, we can get rid
of this directory.
<p>
Go in there as root.  Normally, all we have to do is type <kbd>make</kbd>, 
and Linux will automagically compile the program for us.  However, we have
to pass some extra options to the make with this program.
<p>
<ul>
 <li><kbd>REAL_DAEMON_DIR=/usr/sbin/real-daemon-dir</kbd><p>
     tells <i>tcpd</i> where to look for the *real* daemons to use when
     you try to use the "easy" tcpd method.  More on that after we get the
     sucker installed.<p></li>
 <li><kbd>STYLE=-DPROCESS_OPTIONS</kbd><p>
     This is the whole reason we're recompiling <i>tcpd</i> in the first place.
     This option enables <i>tcpd</i> to use the "shell_command" feature, 
     which in turn lets use do the banners.<p></li>
 <li><kbd>linux</kbd><p>
     This just tells the compiler to use all the options that will produce
     a working binary for Linux.<p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Makefile for <i>tcpd</i> doesn't have an install option,
so you have to put things in place yourself.  Here's a quick list of where
things should go after you've compiled:
<p>
<pre>
Bin File			Location on Your Machine
--------			-----------------------
safe_finger			/usr/sbin/real-daemon-dir/safe_finger
tcpd				/usr/sbin/tcpd
tcpdchk				/usr/sbin/real-daemon-dir/tcpd-chk
tcpdmatch			/usr/sbin/real-daemon-dir/tcpdmatch
try-from			/usr/sbin/real-daemon-dir/try-from
*.3				/usr/man/man3/*.3
*.5				/usr/man/man5/*.5
*.8				/usr/man/man8/*.8
</pre>
<p>
As always, make sure you back up your *old* files before installing the new
ones.
<p>
<center>
<hr>
<h2>The Fun Part -- Banners and Other Stuff</h2>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
Now that we have our new tcpd in place, it's time to get the frame work
in place for our banners.  You can do this in any directory on your machine,
but, in keeping with my own warped view of where things belong, I suggest
creating a dir called <i>/etc/banners</i> and using that for our homebase.
And since I get to be the author, that's the dir I'm going to refer to.
<p>
Once we've got <i>/etc/banners created</i>, we're going to need to do this from
the <i>tcp_wrappers_7.4</i> dir: <p>
<kbd>cp Banners.Makefile /etc/banners/Makefile</kbd>
<p>
And now that the hall is rented and the orchestra engaged, it is time to
dance. (ObNiftyStarTrekQuoteThatI'veBeenDyingToUse)
<p>
<h4>Creating your banners</h4>
<p>
In order to make a banner, all you have to do is go into <i>/etc/banners</i>,
and create a file called <i>prototype</i>.  Put anything you want in here.
It's your banner.  Since this would be a good place for an example, here's
what I put for my banner whenever someone is denied access to my machine:
<p>
<pre>
^[[44m*****************************************************************
                    This is a ^[[m^[[44;01mprivate^[[m^[[44m machine
*******************************************************************^[[m

          If you wish to access this machine, please send email to 
            ^[[01root@loeffel.txdirect.net^[[m
</pre>
<p>
This prints out a nice looking little banner with the first 3 lines in blue,
and the word "private" and root's email address set in bold.  Looks pretty
official.
<p>
Once you have created your <i>prototype</i>, then all you need to do is run
a <i>make</i> in the <i>/etc/banners</i> directory.  This will then produce
4 files (or more, depending on whether you've hacked the Makefile).
<p>
They are <i>in.telnetd</i>, <i>in.ftpd</i>, <i>in.rlogind</i>, and <i>nul</i>.
What you need to do next is create another dir, and move these files into
it.  Since the above example is for the connections that get refused, I
put these in <i>/etc/banners/general-reject</i>.  The last thing to do is
to move the <i>in.*</i> and <i>nul</i> into the new directory.  It's also
a good idea to stick your <i>prototype</i> in there in case you want to change
the banner later on.
<p>
<h4>Making <i>tcpd</i> use the banners</h4>
<p>
This is the last step.  I promise.
<p>
You need to edit your <i>/etc/hosts.allow</i> or <i>/etc/hosts.deny</i> files
so that <i>tcpd</i> knows it should throw up a banner whenever someone tries
to connect.  Basically, my /etc/hosts.deny looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
# /etc/hosts.deny for linux.home.net

ALL:	ALL except .home.net:	banners /etc/banners/general-reject
</pre>
<p>
And that's it.  You can now put up customized banners that will be shown
based upon the hostname of the person who tries to connect to your machine.
Finally, you can take advantage of the "shell_command" option listed in
<b>man 5 hosts_access</b>.  To see what else you can do with this, check
out <b>man 5 hosts_options</b>.
<p>
And, if you're scratching your head wondering what's going on, keep reading.

<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
<h4>How <i>tcpd</i> Works</H4>
<p>
As you know, <i>tcpd</i> hangs around on your system and waits for something
to wake it up.  When that happens, it looks at <i>/etc/hosts.deny</i> and
<i>/etc/hosts.allow</i> to see if the person who is trying to connect matches
any of the patterns you have listed in these files.  If it finds a match, 
then it either lets the connection go through, or it closes the socket.
If it finds a match with a "shell_command" in it, then it will execute that
command.
<p>
The <i>banners</i> option tells <i>tcpd</i> that it needs to send back a
text message to the client that's trying to connect.  When it sees
<i>banners</i> in the <i>allow</i> or <i>deny</i> file, it goes into the
directory that you listed (<i>/etc/banners/general-reject</i> in my example),
and tries to find a file with the same name as the service that the client
requested.  If it finds a file, the contents of the file get pumped back
down to the client, and then <i>tcpd</i> either closes the connection or
lets it go through.  It it doesn't find a file, then <i>tcpd</i> doesn't
send anything back.
<p>
In plain English, if someone tries to telnet in (which would invoke
<i>in.telnetd</i>) and you have a banners options listed for their entry
in one of the <i>hosts.*</i> files, then <i>tcpd</i> looks for a file called
<i>/etc/banners/general-reject/in.telnetd</i>.  If it finds it, it displays
the file, if not, ah well.
<p>
This is important to remember when setting up a banner for your ftp service.
The <i>Banners.Makefile</i> will create a banner file called <i>in.ftpd</i>.
Since most Linux distributions use the Washington University FTP server, 
the service name is actually <i>wu.ftpd</i>.  Therefore, if you intend for
your banner to also be shown to people trying to ftp to your machine, you
either need to change the <i>/etc/banners/general-reject/in.ftpd</i> to
<i>wu.ftpd</i>, or you need to change the name of the service.
<p>
<h4>The 2 Ways to Use <i>tcpd</i></h4>
<p>
You generally have 2 choices on how <i>tcpd</i> protects your services:  
Let <i>inetd</i> handle it, or do a substitution. In my humble opinion,
it's best to let <i>inetd</i> handle it.
<p>
As you may know, <i>inetd</i> is the "super server".  It basically monitors
a bunch of ports, and whenever it detects someone trying to use one of them, 
it starts up the service you have listed in <i>inetd.conf</i>.  This is handy
because you don't run what you don't need, and thusly, unused daemons aren't
sucking up all your system resources.
<p>
<i>inetd</i> can be configured to launch <i>tcpd</i> before it starts up
the service.  In fact, if you take a look in <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i>, you'll
see that it already does for many of your services.  I'll pull one out
so you don't have to flip over to a virutal console:
<p>
<pre>
Service	Socket  Proto   Flags   User     Server name     Arguments
-------	------	-----	-----	----	-----------	---------
telnet  stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
</pre>
<p>
The "Service" entry is just the name of the connection from the file
<i>/etc/services</i>.  This tells <i>inetd</i> what port to listen on.
<p>
The other entries that we're concerned about is the "Server Name" and
"Arguments".  "Server Name", as you can see, points to our good friend
<i>tcpd</i>.  Whenever <i>inetd</i> gets a request for the "Service", it
starts up <i>tcpd</i> with the path to the actual service passed as an
"Argument".  This lets <i>tcpd</i> know what program to run if it exits
and the client has permission to use the service.
<p>
See.  It's pretty easy.
<p>
Your other option is to substitute tcpd for the service directly, and 
not even bother with <i>inetd</i>.  To do this, you just move the daemon
you want to protect to <i>/usr/sbin/real-daemon-dir</i>, and then either
copy <i>tcpd</i> over to where the service used to be, or put in a symbolic
link.
<p>
For example, let's say I want to use <i>tcpd</i> on
<i>/usr/sbin/in.telnetd</i>.  I would simply give the following commands:
<p>
<pre>
mv /usr/sbin/in.telnetd /usr/sbin/real-daemon-dir/in.telnetd
ln -s /usr/sbin/tcp /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
</pre>
<p>
This method is even eaiser than <i>inetd</i>, but I prefer not to have 30
million sym links laying around my system.
<p>
<h4>One Last Thing to Keep in Mind</h4>
<p>
Quoting directly from <i>tcpd</i>'s man page:
<p>
<pre>
       The  tcpd  program  can  be  set  up  to  monitor incoming
       requests for telnet, finger, ftp, exec, rsh, rlogin, tftp,
       talk,  comsat  and  other  services that have a one-to-one
       mapping onto executable files.
</pre>
<p>
Check out that "...services that have a one-to-one mapping onto executable
files" part.
<p>
What that means is that <i>tcpd</i> is designed to be used by services that
spawn 1 daemon for 1 client.  In other words, <i>tcpd</i> won't work for
stuff like <i>ircd</i> or Samba.  Luckily, these programs usually give you
the option to deny access to certain hosts, which accomplishes the same
thing as what <i>tcpd</i> does. 
<p>

<h2>And In Closing...</h2>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
For the answer to any questions you have that I didn't address, please check
the README file that comes with <i>tcp_wrapper</i>.  It does an excellent
job of explaining what's going on, and how to take advantage of some other
features (although some of it is ambiguous about exact locations of where
config files should live due to the fact that the author created
<i>tcp_wrappers</i> to work on a lot of different machines).  Also peruse the
<i>Makefile</i> sometime and see if there's anything else you want to turn on
once you've got a good idea of how this all works.
<p>
And last but not least, the author of <i>tcp_wrappers</i> has given us a
very useful tool <b>free of charge</b>.  If you like it and use it, please
take the time to send him a postcard (snail mail addy at the bottom of the
README)....he's earned it.

<P>
Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites. And, of course, thanks to Michael Montoure for all his
help with graphics and HTML checking.
<P> 
This month has been a very busy one for me. I've been discovering just
how much more work there is to managing a print magazine, <I>Linux Journal</I>,
as opposed to
an electronic one. I'm afraid I've had much less time for <I>LG</I> than before.
If you've written and didn't get a response, this is the reason. It also
means that I'm too close to time to post <i>LG</i> and too little
of it is together -- maybe half as I write this message.
<P> 
However, I have hired an Administrative Assistant, Amy Kukuk, to help
with <I>LJ</I> correspondence and article tracking. She's also going to
help me with <I>LG</I> by reading the news groups and writing the News
Bytes column. So with her good help, I expect the pace to slow
considerably.
<P> 
While <I>Linux Gazette</I> is free for all our readers, it is not free
for its publisher, SSC -- they do pay me for the time I spend putting
it together. In order to help pay for these costs, we've decided to
make <I>LG</I> the PBS of online ezines by having sponsors from the
Linux community. As I am
sure most of you noticed, the Front Page now has a Sponsor section.
We appreciate very much the financial contribution that InfoMagic, our
first sponsor, has made to help us defray our costs.
<P> 
Sorry to be late, I haven't been able to get to our web server since
last Wednesday.
<P> 
Have fun!
