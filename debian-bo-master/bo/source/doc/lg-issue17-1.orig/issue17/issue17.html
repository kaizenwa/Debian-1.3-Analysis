The last couple of months have been rather light on articles. It's been
helpful to have the new chapters for <I>Linux Installation and Getting Starting</I>
to include. So all you budding authors and Linux users out there,
send me your stuff. Don't depend on our regular authors to fill the gap. We
want to hear about all the neat tips and tricks you've found, as well as
all the neat applications your are writing or working with. --Editor

Subject: <b>Searching for Information On Newsgroups</b><br>
From: Roman, <a href="mailto:Roman@pussycat.ping.de">Roman@pussycat.ping.de</a><br>

<p>Hi folks!

<p>I'm installing a very small news- and email system at my local
university (peolpe there are studying arts, so there's no one to help me
with this). I set up one computer with Linux 2.0.29 which is permanently
connected to the 'internet' via ethernet. Then I want to connect a
second PC which is installed in the hallway via nullmodem-cable for all
the students to write and receive eMail. But the problem now is, that
the provider (another part of the university) doesn't give us access to
the newsgroups, so I want to set up at least some local newsgroups on
this Linux-station.

<p>But I just can't seem to find any documentation explaining how to set up
local newsgroups. smtpd and nntpd are running, but the manpages won't
tell anything about how to set up ng's (forgive me if I'm just too blind
or stupid to find the obvious source of information).

<p>So I don't want to bother you explaining me how to accomplish this task,
but perhaps someone can at least tell me where to find the desired
information.

<p>Best regards,
Roman.

Subject: <b>VGA_16 Server</b><br>
From:  Javier Viscain

<p>	Congratulations for the aim and contents of the Gazette.
	Here is an issue I've never seen addressed: the VGA_16
server maintains two monitors (the second monochrome with an
Hercules card) but what only works is the mouse movement, which
moves out of left and right to the other monitor, and console
switching. No window on the monochrome gets focus. Things that
moreless appear on the monochrome but don't work:
<ul>

<li>	Xeyes: both eyes are displayed, but the inner dots
appear as moving diagonal lines out of the eyes.
<li>	Xterm: an useless box appears.
	Xterm with exec: say "xterm -display xxx:0.1 -exec top &"
appears as an xterm box with the letters from "top" without any
order, in and out from the xterm box.
<li>	Xload: the "load" and letters appear out of the box.
</ul>

<p>	I think that the hardware absolute addressing is the
normal VGA one (0A0000 to 0AFFFF) and 64K for the Hercules
(0B0000 to 0BFFFF), which is correct.
	In adition, this server and the mono server are very
buggy when with only the Hercules.
<p>	Any easy solution, or is it that this configuration has not
been debugged?

<p>
TIA, Javier Vizcaino, Madrid, Spain.

Subject: <b>Initilation Files</b><br>
From Karl Easterly <a
href="mailto:bigtexan@mindspring.com">bigtexan@mindspring.com</a><br>

As an article Idea, I think an overview of the major boot scripts would =
be helpful.  The overview could include an objective view of the =
locations, functions, and nifty "tips and tricks" or such.  Also, links =
to how-toos for each script would future simplify the learning curve for =
new users.

<p>Another idea would be to do a chronological installations and =
customization series of articles.  Granted, hardware diversity might be =
a problem and could possibly be subverted by starting the series as =
though  a working installation of Linux has already been installed.  It =
would proceed as a rough idea like this.
<ol>
<li>Booting customization and kernel rebuilding.
<li>Xwin customization, to include the type of activities one =
would do in Win95 desktop setup.
<li>Getting dialup connectivity to work.
<li>Getting network connectivity to work.
</ol>
<p>These are just stabs at a scheme, the actual order would have to be =
hammered out before the series started, but in general, would be helpful =
to have a step by step issue oriented series of articles concerning the =
setup and customization of any linux installation.

Subject: <b>Ideas for Beginners</b><br>
From: stephen jarvis <a href="mailto:106363.2642@compuserve.com">106363.2642@compuserve.com</a>


<p>Hello 
<p>        I am 'the' absolute beginner.I have had a copy of Linux Slackware
and a copy of "Linux configuration and installation " by P Volkerding et al
for about two weeks.Prior to this I had dabbled at dos and wondered(?) at
windows.But when I heard about Linux in a magazine it occured to me that it
might be fun to have a go.And indeed it has been. 
<p>        The only problem I have had is with regard to the man pages. In
general they are technical to a degree that while appropriate for those who
can follow the argument from end to end,are pretty debilitating for the
newbie like me.Indeed I don't always get to the end.
<p>        Perseverence will no doubt pay off and I have expanded my
collection of books already,to take advantage of the possibility of
learning something about programming on Linux.But then I have always had
the kind of curiousity that,while not  enough to kill the cat,is enough to
keep me in the book shop.The point I think is that the man pages themselves
are a bit of a barrier to the wider useage of Linux.
<p>        No doubt others would say the detail and technical clout of this
source of information is needed for those who want to make serious use of
Linux.But not everyone who wants to escape from the soporific influence of
Microsoft is that demanding or that knowledgeable.I think someone needs to
pitch things at the introductory level.In the realms of 'this will get it
going'and 'try this out'.Merely a more chatty approach would help remove
the shiney armour of incomprehensibilty some pages deploy.
<p>        If this sounds a little unfair to the many people who have compiled
,man pages it is most definitley not meant to be.There is a need for
accurate and complete information especially as Linux is a cooperative
venture and everyone needs to have a common root of information.The
question is how can the benefits of Linux be made widely known to people
outside the existing network.What will grab their attention and take the
gleam off Windows 95?Something more open to a wider audience perhaps.
<p>        This does not have to be completely bland and overly simple just in
the range of every day usage.An approach that does not assume that everyone
reading knows the meaning of every term on the page.People need an
introduction to the language of Linux in the way that you might learn
French or English.Start with very basic things and build up in stages.Don't
launch straight into 'How To Compile Your Kernal '.Ok thats important ,but
I am sure most people still think a kernal is what you find inside a nut.I
hope you are getting the general idea.
<p>        What us new people need is probably a collection of basic texts
each about the length of a several page magazine article.Hopefully they
would cover the things that a hardend Linux user would be embarrassed to
ask about.'The kernal for beginners'.'Great now I can ask what it really
is'.If this undertaking was started then I am sure that the end product of
a few months could be published as a small book.Maybe you could publish
it.I think there is a potential market.Many magazines recently covered the
subject of Linux.That's how I got the bug.
<p>        Now it's true there are books already that cover Linux but there
are not many on line man pages or magazine articles that give the beginner
the feeling that they can actually get their system up and running
easily.So if you really want  to publish articles for absolute beginners
bear in mind the kind of language that is used. 
     
<p> Regards       
 Steve Jarvis

<p>ps.. here's some ideas   ' What is the kernal','The basic commands to get
around bash','What are disk partitions and why bother',' To Umsdos or not.
That's the question','Midnight Commander-an introduction','This is the
easiest editor  anybody ever used(insert your choice)','A glossary  of
general terms you'll find on a man page','These books are a good
read(assorted titles)'.'How to get around an info text  with less than 20
pages of instructions','Why the idea of a free and open o/s matters','X is
not a horror film'.

<p>Maybe these are a bit daft but they'd get my attention.They are the sort of
things I'd like to know about.

From: Dani Fricker <a href="mailto:101550.3160@CompuServe.COM">101550.3160@CompuServe.COM</a>

<p>first i wanna say thanx for the lj! great work and fun not even for linuxers!
i need your help. for some reasons i have to identify a user on my webserver by
his/her
ip-address. fact is that users logon comes from different physical machines.
that means
that i have to assign something like a virtual ip-address to a users log name.
something 
like a reversal masquerading.
my ip-gateway connects my inner lan over two token ring network cards 
(sorry, not my idea!) with the internet (lan <-> tr0 <-> tr1 <-> internet). the 
masquerading forward roule of ipfwadm gives me the possibility to indicate a
source and 
a destination address. 
do you see a possibility for an 'address assignment' between the two interfaces?
if you
do please let me know.

Subject:<b>HELP with Man Pages</b>
From: "Mauricio Naranjo N." <a href="mailto:davasgut@col2.telecom.com.co">davasgut@col2.telecom.com.co</a><br>

<p>Well, I have installed the linux toolkit / october 1996 and I have not
been able to install the man pages for commonly used commands like cat,
ls, and so on; instead I have installed the man pages for packages like,
fvwm, midnight commander, ....
<p>	So, I installed man2.tgz, man3.tgz, manpgs.tgz, but I still have not
been able to get installed the whole support for man;
	Can you tell me please, what's the matter????

		Any kind of help would be great appreciated, and excuses for ignorance
but I am new at this OS (finally I found a true one)

Maybe you can help me with this. (I hope)
I switched motherboards, from a zeos pentium 90 that used a serial mouse to a

And now I can't get x-windows to run.
Any ideas?

Subject: <b>Linux</b><br>
From: Tred Riggs <a href="mailto:tred@oak.sfasu.edu">tred@oak.sfasu.edu</a>

<p>I am a college student attending Stephen F. Austin State University.  I
work in a Geographic Information Systems Laboratory (GIS) and we have
been just using AIX machines.  Howerver we do have a full blown linux pc
and it is great.  {Since then I stripped DOS off my PC and made me a
full blown linux box, which works wonderful.  We were considering to
upgrade to all linux PC's in out lab because they were cheaper and
faster than the AIX boxes, but we ran into a problem.  The Software we
need to run to make our GIS maps is not supported by ESRI, so we gave
them a call.  This is what they told us:

<p>"Linux will not be a supported platform.  They told me that product
ports are user driven and there is not enough users wanting this OS."

<p>I could not figure out how they could even say this when all you have to
do is get on the web and see millions of people using linux. So here is
what I want to happen.  I need linux users to E-mail ESRI at
buspartners@esri.com and tell them that you use linux and that there are
many more people using linux too.  ESRI needs to get there head out of
Microsofts world and see what is going on in the real world.

<p>Thanks for your time Linux Gazette,

From: Duncan Simpson <a href="mailto:dps@duncan.telstar.net">dps@duncan.telstar.net</a><br>


<p>Given Micro$oft's tag line of "Yet another Web server powered by NT" maybe we should
collect a list of people doing this sort of stuff on Linux. I can add 3 items myself

<a href="http://mail.telstar.net">http://mail.telstar.net</a> is powered by Linux
The telstar mail service described there is also powered by the same linux box
Astra has switch from NT to Linux for its radius server. (NT was just too expensive
and no better than Linux (Un*x)---the price diffrernece was *1000s* of pounds, each
about 1.5 $ US).

Both astra (and telstar.net) DNS servers are linux.

<p>If the stats show that Linux is more popular for comercial web servers than NT, this would
be something nice to be able to point out...

<p>Duncan (-:
<p>P.S. Any bets when Truetype fonts can be used for proper typesetiing. At present they
lack litagures (fl and various other items that are tradionally rendered as single
characters)?
<p>P.P.S. The use of the present tense (switch) is apt because the change is happening
now. (Despite a bug that is now not being exercised due to an attempt to eradicate it
mail.telstar.net is more reliable than any of various NT machines at handling mail).

X Limitation to 8 Bit Color
</H3>
<P> 
From: Gary Masters <a href="mailto:="mailto:gmasters@devcg.denver.co.us">gmasters@devcg.denver.co.us</a>

<p>I read your question in Linux Gazette regarding an X limitation to 8 bit
color when the system has more than 14 megs of RAM.

Where did you find that information?  I ask because my system has 24 megs
of RAM, and I run 16 bit color all the time.

One difference between our systems is that I am using a Diamond Stealth 64
video card. 

<p>The place I tell X to run in 16 bit mode is in the file
/usr/X11R6/bin/startx.  There is a line in this file that begins with
<tt>serverargs</tt>.  I get 16 bit mode by giving "-bpp 16" as an argument in
this line (e.g. serverargs="-bpp 16").

<p>One problem I did have was that the OpenLook Window Manager (olwm) did not
like 16 bpp mode.  I solved this by switching to the OpenLook Virtual
Window Manager (olvwm)[1].  I also had success using the Tab and FV Window
Managers (twm & fvwm) in 16 bpp mode.


<p>Coming from a SunOS background, I'm used to OpenLook.

Screen Blanking Under X
</H3>
<P> 
From: Gary Masters <a
href="mailto:gmasters@devcg.denver.co.us">gmasters@devcg.denver.co.us</a>

<p>I read your question in the Linux Gazette regarding unwanted screen
blanking under X after upgrading to a newer distribution of Linux.  I had
the same frustration.  Apparently the X servers included in the Xfree86
version distributed with current Linux distributions has screen blanking
compiled as a default behavior.

<p>This behavior can be controlled with the -s option to the server.  Look in
the startx script for a line that begins with serverargs and add "-s 0".
This will disable the X screen blank.

Doubleclick Internet User Profiles
</H3>
<P> 
From: Kragen Javier Sittler <a href="mailto:kragen@pobox.com">kragen@pobox.com</a>

<p>Check out the description of what doubleclick.net does at 
<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/frames/adinfo/dartset.htm">http://www.doubleclick.net/frames/adinfo/dartset.htm</a>

<p>Then decide whether you want to be added to their database of Internet
user profiles.  If not, you can use the script below; I run it in my
<pre>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</pre>.  It prevents any DoubleClick banners from being
displayed, prevents any cookies from being set, and prevents DoubleClick
from collecting any data on you.

<p>It also does the same thing with linkexchange.com, because I find their
constant banners and requests for cookies annoying.  If you'd prefer,
you can take out the linkexchange lines.

<p>However, this will also keep you from receiving *any* information from
doubleclick or linkexchange directly... so you can't visit their web
sites either.

<p>On my machine, I put the script in <pre>/etc/rc.d/rc.doubleclick</pre> and run
it from <pre>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</pre> at boot time, so I'm always protected from
DoubleClick.

How to Mount/Unmount For Users

<P> 
From: Kidong Lee <a href="mailto:kidong@shinbiro.com">kidong@shinbiro.com</a>


<p>When I mount/umount file, I have to login as root.
It's not convenient for me & other users.
but, I found the solution that user who is not root can do mount/umount
in mount man page. 

<p>Take a look at /etc/fstab.
<pre>
# <device>    <mountpoint>   <filesystemtype> <options> <dump>
<fsckorder>
/dev/hdb      /cdrom         iso9660          ro,user   0      0
</pre>
<p>Note "user" in options field.
In options field, if you add "user", users can do mount/umount.

File Transfer With the z Protocol
</H3>
<P> 
From: Gregor Gerstmann, <a href="mailto:gerstman@tfh-berlin.de">gerstman@tfh-berlin.de</a>

<p>Regarding Linux Gazette issue16, April 1997, I have some remarks
regarding the article on file transfer with the z protocol: 
'I type sz <filename> things go along fine, until about 40K
then I get a couple of different error messages....'
We have an internal modem with a transfer rate of 2880 cps on
the telephone line. My son has an account at a Berlin university
with a limited capacity of 5MB. We found the same error but not
limited to a special file size! During the night hours, between 1
and 5h local time, when telephone costs are lowest, we sometimes
transfered files up to 100KB without errors!
To avoid any errors at all, I limited the packages to 20 * 1024
= 20480 bytes, if a CRC occurs, transfer begins once more but with-
out timeout error, because the parcels are small. I use two proce-
dures: the first, Chop, generates another procedure that chops the
file to be transfered with the help of dd into packages and regu-
lates the transfer and removing of transfered packages. At home we
concatenate the packages again with cat ... ... > ... and everything
is ok. The last step could be done by a procedure too.
Of course, it is rather simple software, but it works until we
will use ISDN.
<p>
<pre>

Using ftp Commands in Shellscript
</H3>
<P> 
From: Walter Harms, <a href="Walter.Harms@Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.DE">Walter.Harms@Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.DE</a><br>


Using FTP as a shell-command with ftplib<br>
<p>Working on several different networks means that you always
need to copy your data from net to net. Most ppl use rcp but like most SysOps
I found this to be a terrible security hole. So as I started this job my first
business was to rewrite several scripts that were using rsh,rcp etc.
I replaced them with an ftp based script ftp - &ltinput&gt out 2&gt out.err. 
It's easy to
see that this was not a good idea because ftp was not intended as shell-commando
like cp,mv and the other guys. So I was happy to find the ftplib on a
linux-CD. It's a nice lib that I used to build cmds like ftpmv, ftpcp, ftprm..
This made my scripts much slimmer and simpler. I have some terrible 
copy-scripts running but no problems copying on different systems
like Ultrix or AIX.

<p>Example using ftpget (from the ftplib Author Thomas Pfau)
<pre>ftpget sunsite.unc.edu -r /pub/Linux ls-lR.gz</pre>
This command reads the file <pre>/pub/Linux/ls-lR.gz from sunsite.unc.edu</pre>

Likewise there are other commands with the lib: ftpdir ,ftpsend, ftprm

<p>Who needs ftplib?<br> 
Everybody tired of typing ftp... every evening to
get the latest patches or whatever. Everyone who is regularly copying
with ftp the same Datafiles.

<p>Why use ftplib?<br>
Of course you can add it to you own application but more experienced users don't
have to use these r-commands anymore. An ftpd is available for the
majority of systems so it is easier to access more of them.

<p>Any drawbacks?<br>
Of course, for any ftp session you need a user/paswdr. I copy into
public area using  anonymous/email@ others will need to surly a
password at login, what is not very useful for regular jobs or
you have to use some kind of public login but still I think it's 
easier and better to use than the r-cmds.

ACSII-Artwork Translator
</H3>
<P> 

Here is something interesting which you might consider for publication.
It is a short program written in LEX and C, which takes ASCII-Artwork
and translates it into HTML 3.0 compliant table data.

It is a pretty interesting idea, and as far as I know, I'm the first
person to try something like this, or automate the process.

The translator (a2t) has a few options:
<p>
<ul>
<li>-x :  reverse the output
	This is because some ASCII-Artwork is meant to be seen as
	black on white and not white on black.

<li>-r value
<li>-g value
<li>-b value  
	Sets constant r,g, and or b, rgb values, so that the resulting
	"grayscale" output can be altered to shades of a color.

<li>-w value
	Sets the width of the resulting table.
</ul>
<p>The program was completed just today, so it is very new.  I've 
released it under the GNU license agreement.

<p>For some examples of the output generated by a2t, see:
	<a href="http://wilkes.edu/~pkeane">http://wilkes.edu/~pkeane</a><br>

I think you'll find the results to be pretty amusing, and slightly
more interesting than the usual bag of HTML table-tricks.
<p>
Enjoy--

Including Graphics in Linuxdoc SGML

You can already include PostScript images in Linuxdoc-SGML which
will get included in TeX output (and consequently in DVI and
PostScript).  Linuxdoc-SGML doesn't support images for HTML,
however.
<p>
An example:
<pre>
<figure>
<eps file = "neuro">
<caption><label id = "decade">
Decade of the brain
</figure>
</pre>

<p>You can make references to the figure with <ref id="decade">

<p>PostScript is already supported and the developer version of SGML-Tools
(the successor of Linuxdoc-SGML) now supports HTML as well.  You
can specify a PostScript and a GIF file and depending on the output
(TeX or HTML) the respective image will be included.

X Configuration Issues

Date: Wed Apr 2 12:15:54 1997<BR>
From: Michael J. Hammel, <a href="mailto:mjhammel@emass.com">mjhammel@emass.com</a>
<p>If you get sufficiently tweaked by the X monitor config problems, 
I
suggest X Inside's AcceleratedX package.  Its much simpler to configure
than the XFree package for both cards and monitors.  I used to work
for them, but haven't in over a year.  I still use their package because
its the easiest to handle all the video card/monitor details.

<p>BTW, the monitor setup is menu based.  If your monitor is not listed 
you can just use one of the multisync if single frequency generic 
configs.  No dot clocks, but you do need to no your monitors frequency
capabilities.  These should be listed in the monitors cdocumetntation.

<p>The package is a commercial distribution and runs about $100 (last time
I checked). They change their name to Xi Graphics recently and the domain
for xinside.com might not be working right now. Try <a
href="http://www.xig.com">http://www.xig.com</a>.

Multiple X Displays
</H3>
<P> 

Date: Wed Apr 2 13:38:08 1997<br>                   
From: Michael J. Hammel <a href="mailto:mjhammel@emass.com">mjhammel@emass.com</a><BR>

<p>Setting up the software is probably fairly straight forward.  I've
never used MetroX (I use AcceleratedX instead), however.  Basically
you'll have two choices:
<ol>
<li> Multiple displays (host:0.0 and host:1.0)
<li> Multiple screens of the same display (host:0.0 and host:0.1)
</ol>
<p>The second choice is the one you need if you want to move the mouse
between the two monitors - like when the mouse goes past the right edge
of the first monitor it shows up on the left edge of the second monitor.
You'll have to check with Metro to find out which of these options is
supported and how to configure for it.

<p>The hardware problem is tougher.  The problem lies in the fact that PC's
were not originally designed with the idea that multiple display
adapters would be installed.  The BIOS looks for an adapter at certain 
locations (IRQ, I/O address) and, unless the second card is configurable
to some other address, the system will find multiple cards.  What
happens next is in-determinant.  Some systems won't boot.  Some do but
don't display to either monitor correctly.  

<p>The trick is to find video adapters that were designed to be used 
in conjunction with other video adapters.  Many are not.  The easiest
way for you to find out is check with Metro about what combinations of
video adapters they know work together.  Chances are good the ones you
have don't.  I know X Inside had a list of cards they knew work 
together.  You could search their web site (http://www.xinside.com or
http://www.xig.com) and see if that info is still there.

<p>Hope this helps.

Color Depths with X

From: Michael J. Hammel <a href="mailto:mjhammel@emass.com">mjhammel@emass.com</a><BR>

 After fiddling with the xf86config file in a concerted effort to coax X
 into displaying 16 bit color, I was dismayed to learn that with my
 current hardware (16 megs RAM and a Cirrus Logic GL-5426) 16 bit color
 is *impossible*...not because of any hardware in-capability, but because
 of a certain limitation of X Windows itself...a problem with linear
 addressing. Seems that to have 16 bit color under X, one must have
 linear addressing enabled, which only works if the system has *no more
 than 14 megs RAM*. 

<p>Horse hockeys.  16 bit color is a limitation of the video subsystem and
has nothing to do with the memory of your system.  Linear addressing in
the XFree86 X servers might be tied to system memory amounts, but that
would be a limitation in the XFree86 server, not in X.  X defines
"method without policy", so such limitations just aren't built into X.

<p>A couple of things you should note:  The number of colors available
under 16bit displays is actually *less* than the number available to
8bit displays.  Why this is true has to do with the way 16bit display
hardware works.  The actual color palette for 8 bit displays can have
millions of colors - it can only display 256 colors at a time, however.
Frugal use of colormaps can allow you to have nearly exactly the right
colors for any given application.  16 bit displays only have a palette
of 65k (roughly) colors.  Once those are used up, you're outta luck.

<p>I'm not completely clear on what makes this difference such a problem
but if you visit the Gimp User's mailing list (see the Linux Graphics
mini-howto:  http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel/linux/lgh.html) and ask this
question you'll get similar replies.  Its been discussed quite at length
on the developers list, and most of them read the User's list.

<p>BTW, if you want to see if Linear Addressing is the real problem, try
the X Inside AcceleratedX demo server and see if it works in 16 bit 
color for you.  Generally, your video card needs at least 1M of on board
RAM (not system memory - this is video memory on the video card) to
run in 16Bit mode, but then you'll probably only be able to run in 
640x480 or (at most) 800x600 resolution.  To run at higher resolutions
you'll need more video memory.

<p>Hope this helps.

Figuring Out the Boot Process</BR>
</H3><P> 

Date: Fri, 04 Apr 1997 13:20:40 -0600<br>
From: David Ishee <a href=mailto:dmi1@Ra.MsState.Edu">dmi1@ra.MsState.Edu</a><BR>

One of the things that is confusing about Linux at first is which files
Linux uses to load programs and get the system started at bootup. Once
you figure out which programs are run during the boot process, which
order are they run? Here is an easy solution. 

<p>On my Red Hat 4.0 system, the /etc/rc.d directory tree is where
everything happens. There are a lot of shell scripts in this set of
directories that are run when the system boots. To give yourself a
little more info, add some echo statements to the files. For example:
<pre>
edit /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit and add the following lines at the beginning

echo " "
echo "**** Running /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit ****
echo " "
</pre>
<p>Now when the system is booting you can see exactly when rc.sysinit is
run, and what programs it launches. Repeat the above process for all the
scripts you find. 

<p>Now if the system hangs or gives an error during bootup you have a
better idea of where to look. If you don't have any problems while
booting then at least you have more info about what Linux is doing.

ftping Home</BR>
</H3><P> 

Date: Thu, 3 Apr 1997 20:38:02 +0300 (EET DST)<br>
From: Kaj J. Niemi, <a href="mailto:kajtzu@4u.net">kajtzu@4u.net</a><br>


I read your article about ftping home with dynamic IPs.. Here's
something you might need if you get tired of looking at the screen every
time you want to find out the IP.
<pre>
ADDRESS=`/sbin/ifconfig | awk 'BEGIN { pppok = 0}
                          /ppp.*/ { pppok = 1; next }
                          {if (pppok == 1 ) {pppok = 0; print} }'\
                          | awk -F: '{print $2 }'| awk  '{print $1 }'`

</pre>
<p>Just replace the ppp.* with whatever you want (if you have multiple
ppps running). The easiest thing would to be write a script called ftphome
(or similar) and make it first assign the address and then doing ftp or
ncftp $ADDRESS. The snippet is originally from a local firewall, at the part
where it needs to know what its' own address is. :-)

Computer Comparison

<P> 

Here is a URL that has some interesting data:
<a href="http://fampm201.tu-graz.ac.at/karl/timings30.html">http://fampm201.tu-graz.ac.at/karl/timings30.html</a><br>
This web site is maintained by Karl Unterkofler, and has comparisons of
various computers running the latest versions of Mathemetica. Karl and
others run a series of tests on the machines, that involve timing
mathematical problems.

<p>8 of the 10 fastest machines are running the Mac OS! the first windows
machine doesn't make a showing until 11th place( a pentium pro 200Mhz
running Windows NT 4.0) Incidently this ppro 200 is beat by a Mac 7500
150 Mhz!

<p>You might wonder how this can be when the SPECint95 for Pentium Pros and
for Power PC 604's are so close? Its the operating system dummy!
 
<p>What do I mean?
 
<p>The Intel machines and the Macs are pretty equal, its Windows that slows
things down. If you check out the URL you'll see that although 8 of the
top ten are Macs or Mac clones, 2 of them are Intel pentium Pro 200Mhz
machines. Sadly for the Mac, the number one spot is a Pentium Pro 200
with 64 Meg RAM and a 256kb L2 cache running LINUX 2.0.27.

<p>This barely beats the number 2 machine, a 225Mhz Power Tower Pro from
Power Computing with 256 Meg RAM and a 1Meg L2 cache.

The other Intel in the top 10 is a Pentium Pro 200Mhz with 128Meg Ram and
256Kb L2 cache, running NeXT STEP 3.3.

<p>I don't think that Mac owners should be ashamed of losing to a LINUX
machine. LINUX is the result of an amazing effort put forth by many
dedicated programmers to produce a state of the art 32bit operating
system that utilizes hardware to the fullest. Mac users should be happy
that they can go head to head with such an OS, and still maintain the
great human interface of the Mac!

<p>The only other contender is a NeXT machine! Wait'll your windows friends
see redbox!

Oh, BTW the first Win '95 machine doesn't make a showing until 15th
place. its a Pentium pro 200, 64 MB, 256kb, OS: Win95 and is just below a
PowerMac 7600/120, 48MB, 256kb, MacOS!

<p>So if a windows user tells you their machine is faster, tell them that
you know...if they switch to LINUX.

Word Processor for the Linux Environment
</H3>
<P> 

The development of 'wp', a word processor for the Linux environment has
recently been started. Although it's primary goal is a Linux-based word
processor, wp will eventually be available for many other platforms.

<p>WP is an open system, object orientated, and object driven; written mainly
using C++, although little code has of yet been written. The current
objective is a full design specification/mission statement and determining
the current products that can be used to help the development of the
product further.

<p>Because of this openness, it is proposed to have the user interface
seperate from the main program; the reason for this meaning that the user
can choose whichever interface suits them best, from a ncurses driven text
interface to an X-Windows display using different widget sets.

<p>The web site for Wp is at <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/paulc/wp">http://sunsite.unc.edu/paulc/wp</a> 

<p>If you wish to obtain the design specification notes for wp, they are also
available at the above site.

<p>A FAQ is currently being prepared, if you have any questions or
suggestions, please send them to <a href="mailto:wp@squiznet.demon.co.uk">wp@squiznet.demon.co.uk</a>

<p>If you wish to contribute to the project in any form, please contact
<a href="mailto:paulc@sunsite.unc.edu">paulc@sunsite.unc.edu</a> and introduce yourself, a copy of which will be sent
to the wp-developers mailing list unless you specifically state that you
do not wish for this to happen.

fs's
</h3>
<P><B>
From: Aaron M. Lee <a
href="mailto:aaron@shifty.adosea.com">aaron@shifty.adosea.com</a><br>
 
<p>Howdy Jim, 
My name's Aaron and I am sysadmin Cybercom Corp., an ISP in 
College Station, TX. We run nothing but Linux, and have been involved w/ 
a lot of hacking and development on a number of projects. I have an 
unusual problem and have exhausted my resources for finding an answer- so 
I thought you might be able to help me out, if you've got the time. 
Anyway, here goes...
<p>I've got a scsi disk I was running under Sparclinux that has 3       
partitions, 1 Sun wholedisk label, 2 ext2. That machine had a heart
attack, and we don't have any spare Hypersparcs around- but I _really_
need to be able to mount that drive to get some stuff off of it. I compiled
in UFS fs support w/ Sun disklabel support into the kernel of an i386 Linux
box, but the when I try to mount it, it complains that /dev/sd** isn't a
valid block device, w/ either the '-t ufs' or '-t ext2' options. Also,
fdisk thinks the fs is toast, and complains that the blocks don't end
in physical boundaries (which is probably the case for an fdisk that
doesn't know about Sun disklabels), and can't even tell that the
partitions are ext2 (it thinks one of them is AIX!). Any ideas?
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Consider the nascent state of Sparc support for Linux
	I'm not terribly surprised that you're having problems.

	You seem to be asking:
		"How do I get Linux/Intel to see the fs on 
		 this disk?"

<p>	However I'm going to step back from the that question
	and ask the broader question:

		"How do you recover the (important) data off of 
		that disk in a usable form?"

<p>	Then I'll step back even further and ask:

		"How important is that data? (what is its
		recovery worth to you)?"

<p>	... and<br>

		"What were the disaster plans, and why
		are those plans inadequate for this 
		situation?"

<p>	If you are like most ISP's out there -- you have not
	disaster or recovery plans, and little or no backup 
	strategy.  Your boss essentially asks you to running 
	back and forth on the high wire at top speed -- without 
	a net.

<p>	As a professional sysadmin you must resist the pressure
	to perform in this manner -- or at least you owe it to
	yourself to carefully spell out the risks.

<p>	In this case you had a piece of equipment that was
	unique the Sparc system -- so that any failure of 
	any of its components would result in the lack of 
	access to all data on that system.  

<p>	Your question makes it clear that you didn't have 
	sufficiently recent backups of the data on that 
	system (otherwise the obvious solution would be 
	to restore the data to some other system and 
	reformat the drive in question).
	
<p>	My advice would be to rent (or even borrow) a 
	SPARC system for a couple of days (a week is a 
	common minimum rental period) -- and install
	the disk into that.  

<p>	Before going to the expense of renting a system
	(or buying a used one) you might want to ensure
	that the drive is readable at the lowest physical
	level.  Try the dd command on that device.  Something
	like:

<pre>		dd if=/dev/sda | od | less
</pre>
<p>	... should let you know if the hardware is operational.
	If that doesn't work -- double and triple-check all of the
	cabling, SCSI ID settings, termination and other hardware
	compatibility issues.  (You may be having some weird problem
	with a SCSI II differential drive connecting to an 
	incompatible controller -- if this is an Adaptec 1542B
	-- be sure to break it in half before throwing it away
	to save someone else the temptation (the 1542C series is
	fine but the B series is *BAD*)).

<p>	Once you are reasonably confident that the hardware 
	is talking to your system I'd suggest doing a direct,
	bitwise, dump of the disk to a tape drive.  Just use a 
	command like:

<pre>		dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/st0
</pre>
<p>	... if you don't have a sufficiently large tape drive
	(or at least a sufficiently large spare hard disk) *and
	can't get one* than consider looking for a better 
	employer.

<p>	Once you have a tape backup you can always get back 
	to where you are now.  This might not seem so great
	(since you're clearly not where you'd like to be) but
	it might be infinitely preferable to where you'll be
	if you have a catastrophic failure on mounting/fsck'ing
	that disk.

<p>	For the broader problem (the organizational ones rather
	than the technical ones) -- you need to review 
	the requirements and expectations of your employer -- 
	and match those against the resources that are being
	provided.  

<p>	If they require/expect reliable access to their data -- 
	they must provide resources towards that end.  The most
	often overlooked resource (in this case) is sysadmin
	time and training.  You need the time to develop 
	disaster/recovery plans -- and the resources to test 
	them.   (You'd be truly horrified at the number of sites 
	that religiously "do backups" but have an entire staff that
	has never restored a single file from those).

<p>	Many organizations can't (or won't) afford a full spare
	system -- particularly of their expensive Sparc stations.
	They consider any system that's sitting on a shelf to be a
	"waste."  -- This is a perfectly valid point of view.
	However -- if the production servers and systems are 
	contributing anything to the companies bottom line --
	there should be a calculable cost for down time.  If that's
	the case then there is a basis for comparison to the costs of 
	rentals, and the costs of "spare" systems. 

<p>	Organizations that have been informed of this risks and 
	costs (by there IS staff) and continue to be unwilling or
	unable to provide the necessary resources will probably
	fail.

Thanks in advance for any possible help,

It's often the case that I respond with things that
I suspect my customer don't want to hear.

The loss of this data (or the time lost to recovering
it) is an opportunity to learn and plan -- you may 
prevent the loss of much more important information 
down the road if you now start planning for the 
inevitable hardware and system failures.

Linux/Unix Emulator                       
</h3>
<P><B>
From:Steven W., <a href="mailto:steven@gator.net">steven@gator.net</a><br>
 
<p> Can you help me?  Do you know of a Unix (preferably Linux) emulator
 that runs under Windows95?
<p> -- Steven.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	Short Answer:

		I don't know of one.

<p>	Longer Answer:

<p>	This is a tough question because it really doesn't 
	*mean* anything.  An emulator is a piece of software
	that provide equivalent functionality to other software
	or hardware.  Hopefully this software is indistinguishable
	from the "real" thing in all ways that count.

	<p>	(Usually this isn't the case -- most VT100
		 terminal emulation packages have bugs in them
		 -- and that is one of the least complicated
		 and most widespread cases of emulation in the
		 world).

<p>	A Unix "emulator" that ran under Win '95 would probably not be 
	of much use.  However I have to ask what set of features
	you want emulated?

<p>		Do you want a Unix-like command shell (like 
		Korn or Bash)?  This would give you some of the
		"feel" of Unix.

<p>		Do you want a program that emulates one of the 
		GUI's that's common on Unix?  There are X Windows
		"display servers" (sort of like "emulators") that
		run under NT and '95.  Quarterdeck's eXpertise
		would be the first I would try.

<p>		Do you want a program that allows you to run
		some Unix programs under Win '95?  There are
		DOS, OS/2, and Windows (16 and 32 bit) ports of 
		many popular Unix programs -- including most of 
		the GNU utilities.  Thus bash, perl, awk, sed,
		vi, emacs, tar, and hundreds of other utilities
		can be had -- most of them for free.

<p>		Do you want to run pre-compiled Unix binaries
		under Win '95?  This would be a very odd request
		since there are dozens of implementations of 
		Unix for the PC platform and hundreds for other
		architectures (ranging from Unicos on Cray super-
		computers to Minix and Coherent on XT's and 286's).
		Binary compatibility has playing only a tiny role
		in the overall Unix picture.  I suspect that 
		supporting iBCS (a standard for Unix binaries on 
		intel processors -- PC's) under Win '95 would be a
		major technical challenge (and probably never
		provide truly satisfying results).

<p>		*note*: One of the papers presented at Usenix in 
		Anaheim a couple of months ago discussed the 
		feasibility of implementing an improved Unix
		subsystem under NT -- whose claim of POSIX support
		as proven to be almost completely useless in the
		real world.  Please feel free to get a copy of 
		the Usenix proceeding if you want the gory details
		on that.  It might be construed as a "Unix emulation"
		for Windows NT -- and it might even be applicable to 
		Win '95 -- with enough work.

<p>		If you're willing to run your Windows programs
		under Unix there's hope.  WABI currently supports
		a variety of 16-bit Windows programs under Linux
		(and a different version support them under Solaris).
		Also work is continuing on the WINE project -- and
		some people have reported some success in running
		Windows 3.1 in "standard mode" under dosemu (the
		Linux PC BIOS emulator).  The next version of WABI
		is expect to support (at least some) 32-bit Windows
		programs.

<p>	My suggestion -- if this is of any real importance to you --
	is that you either boot between Unix and DOS/Windows or that
	you configure a separate machine as a Unix host -- put it in
	a corner -- and using your Win '95 system as a terminal,
	telnet/k95 client and/or an X Windows "terminal" (display
	server).  

<p>	By running any combination of these programs on your Windows 
	box and connecting to your Linux/Unix system  you won't have 
	to settle for "emulation."  You'll have the real thing -- 
	from both sides.  In fact one Linux system can serve as the
	"Unix emulation adapter" for about as many DOS and Windows
	systems as you care to connect to it.

<p>	(I have one system at a client site that has about 32Mb
	of RAM and 3Gb -- it's shared by about 300 shell and
	POP mail users.  Granted only about 20 or 30 of them are 
	ever shelled at any given time but it's no where near it's 
	capacity).

<p>	I hope this gives you some idea why your question is
	a little non-sensical.  Operating systems can be viewed
	from three sides -- user interface (UI), applications
	programming interface (API), and supported hardware
	(architecture).

<p>	Emulating one OS under another might refer to emulating
	the UI, or the API or both.  Usually emulation of the
	hardware support is not feasible (i.e. we can't run DOS
	device drivers to provide Linux hardware support).

<p>	If one implemented the full set of Unix system calls
	in a Win '95 program that provided a set of "drivers"
	to translate a set of Unix like hardware abstractions
	into calls to the Windows device drivers -- and one
	ported a reasonable selection of software to run under
	this "WinUnix kernel" -- one could call that "Unix emulation."
	
<p>	However it would be more accurate to say that you had 
	implemented a new version of Unix on a virtual machine
	which you hosted under Windows.

<p>	Oddly enough this is quite similar to what the Lucent
	(Formerly Bell Labs?) Inferno package does.  Inferno
	seems to have evolved out of the Plan 9 research project
	-- which apparently was Dennis Ritchie's pet project for
	a number of years.  I really don't know enough about 
	the background of this package -- but I have a CD 
	(distributed to attendees of the aforementioned Usenix
	conference) which has demo copies of Inferno for several
	"virtual machine" platforms (including Windows and Linux).

<p>	Inferno is also available as a "native" OS for a couple
	of platforms (where it includes it's own device drivers
	and is compiled as direct machine code for a machine's
	platform).  

<p>	One reason I mention Inferno is that I've heard that
	it offers features and semantics that are very similar
	to those that are common in Unix.  I've heard it described
	as a logical outgrowth of Unix that eschews some of the 
	accumulation of idiosyncrasies that has plagued Unix.

<p>	One of these days I'll have to learn more about that.

 I have Windows95 and Linux on my system, on separate partitions, I
 can't afford special equipment for having them on separate machines. 
 I really like Linux, and Xwindows, mostly because of their great
 security features.  (I could let anybody use my computer without
 worrying about them getting into my personal files).  Windows95's
 pseudo-multi-user system sucks really bad.  So, mainly, this is why I
 like Linux.  I also like the way it looks.  Anyways, I would just run
 Linux but my problem is that Xwindows doesn't have advanced support
 for my video card, so the best I can get is 640x480x16colors and I
 just can't deal with that.  Maybe I'm spoiled.  The guy I wrote on
 the Xwin development team told me that they were working on better
 support for my card, though.  (Aliance Pro-Motion).  But, meanwhile,
 I can't deal with that LOW resolution.  The big top-it-off problem is
 that I don't know of anyway to have Linux running _while_ Win95 is
 running, if there even is a way.  If there was, it would be great,
 but as it is I have to constantly reboot and I don't' like it.  So
 this is how I came to the point of asking for an emulator.  Maybe
 that's not what I need after all.  So what can I do?  Or does the
 means for what I want not exist yet?

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	If you prefer the existing Linux/X applications and 
	user interface -- and the crux of the problem is support
	for your video hardware -- focus on that.  It's a simpler
	problem -- and probably offers a simpler solution.

<p>	There are basically three ways to deal with a lack of
	XFree86 support for your video card:

<ul>	
<li>          	 Help write an XFree86 driver
		 (I'm not a coder either -- but I do occasionally
		 beat the bushes and offer bribes to coder 
		 friends)

<li>		 Look for Metro-X or other (probably commercial)
		  support.  (A copy of Metro-X comes with Red Hat
		  4.1 for about $50 -- so this is not outrageously
		  expensive).

<li>		 Replace the video card.  There are plenty of 
		  really good video cards that are supported by
		  XFree86.  Number 9, and Matrox have good track
		  records.  Some of the 2Mb PCI cards are only
		  about $100 (US).
</ul>
<p>	Be sure to contact the manufacturer to ask for a 
	driver.  Point out that they may be able to make 
	small changes to an existing XFree86 driver.  You
	can even offer to help them find a volunteer
	(where you post to the comp.os.linux.dev...sys. 
	newsgroup and one or two of the developer's mailing
	lists -- and offer some support).  Just offering to 
	do some of the "legwork" maybe be a significant 
	contribution.

<p>	This is an opportunity to be a "Linux-Activist."

Using X with 2 Monitors and 2 Video Cards
</h3>
<P><B>
From:Charles A. Barrasso<a
href="mailto:charles@blitz.com">charles@blitz.com</a><br>

I was wondering how I would go about using X with 2 monitors and 2
video cards?  I am currently using XFree86 window manager.  I know you
can do this with the MetroX window manager but that costs money :(.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	I'm sure I gave a lengthy answer to this fairly recently.
	Maybe it will appear in this month's issue (or maybe 
	I answered it on a newsgroup somewhere).

<p>	In any event, the short answer is:  You don't.

<p>	The PC architecture doesn't support using multiple
	VGA/EGA cards concurrently.  I don't think XFree86 can
	work with CGA cards (and who'd want to!).  You might
	be able to get a Hercules compatible Monochrome Graphics 
	Adapter (MGA) to work concurrently with a VGA card (since
	they don't use overlapping address spaces).  I don't know
	if this is the method that Metro-X supports.

<p>	There are specialized video adapters (typically very expensive
	--  formerly in the $3000+ range) that can co-exist with
	VGA cards.  Two sets of initials that I vaguely recall are
	TIGA and DGIS.  Considering that you seem unwilling to 
	pay $100 (tops) for a copy of Metro-X I think these --
	even if you can still find any of them -- are way out of 
	your price league.

<p>	Another, reasonable, alternative is to connect a whole
	Xterminal or another whole system and run X on that.  You 
	can then remotely display your windows on that about as
	easily as you could set them to display on the local 
	server.  

<p>	(I know -- you might not get some cool window manager
	to let you drag windows from one display server to another
	-- a trick which I've seen done with Macs under MacOS and 
	with Suns and SGI's.  But I've never set one of those up 
	anyway -- so I couldn't begin to help you there).

<p>	You might double check with the Metro-X people to see
	what specific hardware is required/supported by their 
	multiple display feature and then check with the XFree86.org
	to see if anyone has any drivers for one of those supported
	configurations.

<p>	As a snide note I find your phrase "that costs money :(" 
	to be mildly offensive.  First the cost of an additional 
	monitor has got to be at least 3 times the price of 
	a copy of Metro-X.  Second "free" software is not about
	"not having to pay money."  

<p>	I'm not trying to sell you a copy of Metro-X here.  I 
	don't use it -- and I specifically choose videos cards
	that are supported by XFree86 when I buy my equipments.

<p>	Likewise I don't recommend Linux to my customers because 
	it "doesn't cost them anything."  In fact it does cost 
	them the time it takes me to install, configure and maintain
	it -- which goes for about $95/hr currently.  I recommend
	Linux because it is a better tool for many jobs -- and because
	the benefits of it's being "free" -- in the GNU sense of the
	term -- are an assurance that no one can "have them over a 
	barrel" for upgrades or additional "licensing" fees.  They are
	always *free* to deploy Linux on as many systems as they want,
	have as many users and/or processes as they want on any system,
	make their own modifications to the vast majority of tools
	on the system or hire any consultants they want to make the 
	customizations they need.

<p>	I'm sorry to be so "political" here -- but complaining
	that Metro-X "costs money" and asking me for a way to 
	get around that just cost me about $50 worth of my time.
	Heck -- I'll go double or nothing -- send my your postal
	address and I'll buy you a copy of RedHat 4.1.  That comes
	with a license for one installation of Metro-X and only
	costs about $50.  I'll even cover the shipping and handling.

<p>	(Please call them first to make sure that it really does
	support your intended hardware configuration).

Virtual Hosting

Automatic File Transfer

<P><B>
From:Kenneth Ng, <a href="mailto:kenng@kpmg.com">kenng@kpmg.com</a><br>

In Linux Gazette, there is a mention of how to transfer files
automatically using ftp.

Here is how:
<pre> 
 #!/bin/csh
 ftp -n remote.site << !
 user joe blow
 binary
 put newfile
 quit
 !

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	That's one of several ways.  Another is to use ncftp
	-- which supports things like a "redial" option to keep

	a more advanced macro facility than the standard .netrc (FTP).

<p>	You can also use various Perl and Python libraries (or classes)
	to open ftp sessions and control them.  You could use 'expect'
	to spawn and control the ftp program.

<p>	All of these methods are more flexible and much more robust

I just installed wu-ftpd on my linux box.  I have version 2.4.
I can login under one of my accounts on the system and everything
works just fine.

	wu-ftpd takes that as a hint to allow *anonymous* FTP. 
	If you do have one -- or need to create one -- be sure that

	You should also set the shell to something like /bin/false or

	What does your /etc/ftpaccess file look like?

<p>	Did you compile a different path for the ftpaccess file
	(like /usr/local/etc/)?  

<p>	What authentication libraries are you using (old 
	fashioned DES hashes in the /etc/passwd, shadow,
	shadow with MD5 hashes -- like FreeBSD's default,
	or the new PAM stuff)?

<p>	Is this invoked through inetd.conf with tcpd 
	(the TCP Wrappers)?  If so, what does your /var/log/messages
	say after a login failure?  (Hint: use the command:
	'tail -f /var/log/messages > /dev/tty7 &' to leave a continuously
	updated copy of the messages file sitting on one of your 
	-- normally unused -- virtual consoles).
<p>
	One trick I've used to debug inetd launched programs (like
	ftpd and telnetd) is to wedge a copy of strace into the 
	loop.  Change the reference to wu.ftpd to trace.ftpd --
	create a shell or perl script named trace.ftpd that consists
	of something like:
<pre>
		#! /bin/sh
		exec strace -o /tmp/ftpd.strace /usr/sbin/wu.ftpd

Trying to Boot a Laptop 
</h3>
<P><B>
From: Yash Khemani, <a href="mailto:khemani@plexstar.com">khemani@plexstar.com</a><br>
 
I've got a Toshiba satellite pro 415cs notebook computer on which I've
installed RedHat 4.1.  RedHat 4.1 was installed on a jaz disk connected
via an Adaptec slimscsi pcmcia adapter. the installation went
successfully, i believe, up until the lilo boot disk creation.  i
specified that i wanted lilo on a floppy - so that nothing would be
written to the internal ide drive and also so that i could take the
installation and run it at another such laptop.  after rebooting, i
tried booting from the lilo floppy that was created, but i get nothing
but continuous streams of 0 1 0 1 0 1...
</B>
<p><B>i am guessing that the lilo floppy does not have on it the pcmcia
drivers.  what is the solution at this point to run RedHat on this
machine?
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	You've got the right idea.
	The 1010101010101... from LILO is a dead giveaway that 
	your kernel is located on some device that cannot be 
	accessed via the BIOS.

<p>	There are a couple of ways to solve the problem.
	I'd suggest LOADLIN.EXE.

<p>	LOADLIN.EXE is a DOS program (which you might have
	guessed by the name) -- which can load a Linux kernel
	(stored as a DOS file) and pass it parameters (like
	LILO does).  Basically LOADLIN loads a kernel (Linux or
	FreeBSD -- possibly others) which then "kicks" DOS 
	"out from under it." In other words -- it's a one-way
	trip.  The only way back to DOS is to reboot (or 
	run dosemu ;-) . 

<p>	LOADLIN is VCPI compatible -- meaning that it can run 
	from a DOS command prompt even when you have a memory
	manager (like QEMM) loaded.  You can also set LOADLIN
	as your "shell" in the CONFIG.SYS.  That's particularly
	handy if you're using any of the later versions of DOS
	that support a multi-boot CONFIG.SYS (or you're using the
	MBOOT.SYS driver that provided multi-boot features in 
	older versions of DOS).

<p>	To use LOADLIN you may have to create a REALBIOS.INT
	file (a map of the interrupt vectors that are set by
	your hardware -- before any drivers are loaded).  
	To do this you use a program (REALBIOS.EXE) to create 
	a special boot floppy, then you boot off that floppy
	(which records the interrupt vector table in a file)
	-- reboot back off your DOS system and run the second
	stage of the REALBIOS.EXE.

<p>	This little song and dance may be necessary for each
	hardware configuration.  (However you can save and
	copy each of the REALBIOS.INT files if you have a 
	couple of configurations that you switch between --
	say, with a docking station and without).

<p>	With LOADLIN you could create a DOS bootable floppy,
	with a copy of LOADLIN.EXE and a kernel (and the 
	REALBIOS.INT -- if it exists).  All of that will 
	just barely fit on a 1.44M floppy.

<p>	Another way to do this would be to create a 
	normal DOS directory on your laptop's IDE drive --
	let's call it C:\LINUX (just to be creative).

<p>	Then you'd put your LOADLIN.EXE and as many different
	kernels as you liked in that directory -- and maybe
	a batch file (maybe it could be called LINUX.BAT) to
	call LOADLIN with your preferred parameters.  Here's a 
	typical LINUX.BAT:
<pre>
		@ECHO OFF
		ECHO "About to load Linux -- this is a one-way trip!"
		PAUSE
		LOADLIN lnx2029.krn root=/dev/sda1 ro
</pre>
<p>	(where LNX2029.KRN might be a copy of the Linux-2.0.29
	kernel -- with a suitable DOS name).

<p>	I'd also recommend another batch file (SINGLE.BAT) that
	loads Linux in single-user mode (for fixing things when
	they are broken).  That would replace the LOADLIN line
	in the LINUX.BAT with a line like:

	<pre>	LOADLIN lnx2029.krn single root=/dev/sda ro
</pre>
<p>	Another way to do all of this is to simply dd a 
	properly configured kernel to a floppy.  You use the 
	rdev command to patch the root device flags in the
	kernel and dump it to a floppy.  This works because
	a Linux kernel is designed to work as a boot image.
	The only problem with this approach is that it doesn't
	allow you to pass any parameters to your kernel (to 
	force single user mode, to select an alternate root 
	device/filesystem, or whatever).

<p>	For other people who have a DOS system and want to 
	try Linux -- but don't want to "commit" to it with 
	a "whole" hard drive -- I recommend DOSLINUX.

<p>	A while back there was a small distribution called
	MiniLinux (and another called XDenu) which could
	install entirely within a normal DOS partition --
	using the UMSDOS filesystem.  Unfortunately MiniLinux
	has not been maintained -- so it's stuck with a 1.2
	kernel and libraries.

<p>	There were several iterations of a distribution called
	DILINUX (DI= "Drop In") -- which appears to have eventually
	evolved into DOSLINUX.  The most recent DOSLINUX seems was
	uploaded to the Incoming at Sunsite within the last two
	weeks -- it includes a 2.0.29 kernel.

<p>	The point MiniLinux and DOSLINUX is to allow one to install
	a copy of Linux on a DOS system as though it were a DOS
	program.  DOSLINUX comes as about 10Mb of compressed
	files -- and installs in about 20-30Mb of DOS file space.
	It includes Lynx, Minicom, and a suite of other utilities
	and applications.

<p>	All in all this is a quick and painless way to try Linux.
	So, if you have a DOS using friend who's sitting on the fence, 
	give them a copy of DOSLINUX and show them how easy it is.

zmodem Reply 
</h3>

From: Donald Harter Jr., <a href="mailto:harter@mufn.org">harter@mufn.org</a><br>

I saw your post about zmodem in the Linux Gazette.  I can't answer the 
readers question, but maybe this will help.  My access to the internet is a 
dial in account(no slip, no ppp).  I access the freenets.  I can't use 
zmodem to transfer files from the internet and freeenets to my pc.  I can 
use kermit though.  It seems that there are some control characters involved 
in zmodem that prevent it from being used with my type of connection.  I saw 
a some information about this on one of the freenets.  They suggested using 
telix and another related protocol.  I tried that, but it didn't work 
either.  Kermit is set up to run slow.  You can get kermit to go faster in 
certain circumstances by executing its "FAST" macro.  I can download data at 
about 700cps with the "FAST" macro of kermit.  Unfortunately kermit hangs up 
the line for me so I have to "kill -9 kermitpid" to exit it.  That  problem 
can probably be eliminated with the right compile options.  In certain cases 
I can't use the "FAST" macro when uploading.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	I'm familiar with C-Kermit.  In fact I may have an
	article in the June issue of SysAdmin magazine on that very
	topic.

<p>	The main points of my article are that C-Kermit is a
	telnet and rlogin client as well as a serial communications
	program -- and that it is a scripting language that's 
	available on just about every platform around.

<p>	I know about Telix' support for the kermit transfer protocol.
	It sucks.  On my main system I get about 1900 cps for
	ZMODEM transfers -- about 2200 for kermit FAST (between
	a copy of C-Kermit 5A(188) and 6.0.192 and about 70 cps 
	(yes -- seventy!) between a copy of C-Kermit and Telix'
	internal kermit.

<p>	Other than that I've always liked Telix.  Minicom has
	nice ncurses and color -- but is not nearly as featureful
	or stable as either Telix for DOS or any version of C-Kermit.

<p>	Your line hangups probably have to do with your settings for
	carrier-watch.  Try SET CARRIER-WATCH OFF or ON and see if 
	it still "hangs" your line.  I suspect that its actually just
	doing read() or write() calls in "blocking" mode.  You might
	have to SET FLOW-CONTROL NONE, too.  There are lots of 
	C-Kermit settings.  If you continue to have trouble -- post
	a message to the comp.protocols.kermit.misc newsgroup
	(preferred) or send a message to kermit-support@columbia.edu.

<p>	When I first started using C-Kermit (all of about two months
	ago) my initial questions where answered by Frank da Cruz 
	himself (he's the creator of the Kermit protocol and the 
	technical lead of the Kermit project at Columbia University).
	(That was before he knew that I'm a "journalist" -- O.K.
	quit laughing!).  Frank is also quite active in the newsgroup.
	I think he provides about 70 or 80 per cent of the technical
	support for the project.

<p>	Oh yeah!  If you're using C-Kermit you should get the 
	_Using_C-Kermit_ book.  It was written by Frank da Cruz and
	Christine Gianone -- and is the principal source of funding
	for the Kermit project.  From what I gather a copy of the 
	book is your license to use the software.

StartX 
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Robert Rambo, <a href="mailto:robert.rambo@yale.edu">robert.rambo@yale.edu</a><br>
 
Hi, I was wondering if you can help me out.  When I use the command
'startx -- -bpp16' to change the color depth, the windows in X are much
bigger than the monitor display.  So, nothing fits properly and
everything has become larger.  But the color depth has changed
correctly.  I use FVWM as my display manager.  Is there some way to fix
this problem?
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
If using the 16 bit plan (16bpp) mode to increase 
your color depth -- that suggests that selecting this
mode is causing the server to use a lower resolution.

<p>	That is completely reasonable.  If you have a 2Mb video
card and you run it in 1024x768x256 or 1024x768x16 --
then you try to run it with twice as many colors -- 
the video RAM has to come from somewhere.  So it 
bumps you down to 800x600 or 640x480.  These are just
examples.  I don't deal with graphics much so I'd have
to play with a calculator to figure the actual maximum
modes that various amounts of video RAM could support.

<p>	There are alot of settings in the XConfig file.  You 
may be able to tweak them to do much more with your 
existing video card.  As I've said before -- XConfig
files are still magic to me.  They shifted from blackest
night to a sort of charcoal gray -- but I can't do them
justice in a little article hear.  Pretty much I'd have 
to lay hands on it -- and mess with it for a couple of
hours (and I'm definitely not the best one for that job).

<p>	If you haven't upgraded to a newer XFree86 (3.2?) then
this would be a good time to try that.  The newer one
is much easier to configure and supports a better selection
of hardware -- to a better degree than the older versions.
I haven't heard of any serious bugs or problems with
the upgrades.

<p>	You may also want to consider one of the commercial servers.
Definitely check with them in advance to be absolutely certain
that your hardware is supported before you buy.  Ask around in
the newsgroups for opinions about your combination of hardware.
It may be that the XFree86 supports you particular card better
than Metro-X or whatever.

<p>	You may also want to look at beefing up your video hardware.
As I've said -- I don't know the exact figures -- but I'd
say that you probably need a 4Mb card for anything like
16bpp at 1024x768.  You should be able to look up the 
supported modes in your card's documentation or on the 
manufacturer's web site or BBS.


<B><P><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
Also, is there some way to change the color depth
setting to start X with a depth of 16 every time.  I do not use the XDM
manager to initiate an X session.  
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

Yes -- it's somewhere in that XConfig file.  I don't 
remember the exact line.  I really wish a bona fide GUI
X wiz would sign up for some of this "Answer Guy" service.

<p>	It doesn't matter whether you use xdm or not.  If you 
put the desired mode in the  XConfig file.  However --
since you don't you could just write your own wrapper 
script, alias or shell function to call 'startx' with
the -- -bpp16 options.  You could even re-write 'startx'
(it is just a shell script).  That may seem like cheating --
but it may be easier than fighting your way through the 
XConfig file (do you get the impression that I just don't
like that thing -- it is better than a WIN.INI or a 
SYSTEM.INI -- but not be much).

IMAP and Linux
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Brian Moore, <a
href="mailto:bem@thorin.cmc.net">bem@thorin.cmc.net</a><br>             

Being a big IMAP fan (and glad to see it finally getting recognition:
Netscrape 4 and IE4 will both support it), your answer left a lot out.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

Will these support the real features (storing and 
organizing folders on the server side)? 

<p>	I heard that NS "Communicator" (the next release 
Netscape's Navigator series is apparently going to 
come with a name change) supports IMAP -- but it's 
possible to implement this support as just a variant
of POP -- get all the message and immediately 
expunge all of them from the server.  

<p>	It seems that this is how Eric S. Raymond's 'fetchmail' 
treating IMAP mail boxes -- as of about 2.5 (it seems 
that he's up to 3.x now)

<P><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>The easiest IMAP server to install is certainly the University of
Washington server.  It works, handles nearly every mailbox format around
and is very stable.  It's also written by the guy in charge of the IMAP
spec itself, Mark Crispin.

As for clients, there is always Pine, which knows how to do IMAP quite
well.  This is part of most Linux distributions as well.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

I did mention pine.  However it's not my personal favorite.

Do you know of a way to integrate IMAP with emacs mh-e/Gnus
(or any mh compatible folder management system)?

<P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>For GUI clients there is ML, which is a nice client, but requires Motif
and can be slow as sin over a modem when you have a large mailbox. 
That's available in source at
http://www-CAMIS.Stanford.EDU/projects/imap/ml
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

I thought I mentioned that one as well -- but it's 
a blur to me.

<p>	I personally avoid GUI's like the plague.  I'm
typing this from my laptop, through a null modem link
to my machine in the other room.  

<p>	I run emacs under screen -- so I can use mh-e for most 
mail, Gnus for netnews and for some of my mailing lists 
(it can show news folders as though they were threaded 
news groups). screen allows me to detach my session from 
my terminal so I can log out, take off with the laptop, 
and re-attach to the same session later (via modem or when 
I get back home).

<P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>Asking on the mailing list about static linked linux versions will get
you one (and enough nagging may get them to actually put one of the
current version up).

ML is really the nicest mail client I have ever used.

As for pop daemons with UIDL support, go for qpopper from qualcomm. 
ftp.qualcomm.com somewhere.  Has UIDL and works fine.
</B><P>

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

O.K.  I'll at that to my list.

<p>	Does that one also support APOP's authentication
mechanism (which I gather prevents disclosing your 
password over an untrusted network by using something
like an MD5 hash of your password concatenated with 
a date and time string -- or something like that)?

<p>	Does qpopper allow you to maintain a POP user account
file that's separate from your /etc/passwd file?

<p>	Do you know of an IMAP server that supports these 
sorts of features (secure authentication and separate
user base)?

<p>	(I know this probably seems like a switch -- the
so called "Answer Guy" asking all the questions --
but hey -- I've got to get my answers from *somewhere*)

More IMAP
</H3><P> <B> 
From: Graham Todd, <a href="mailto:gtodd@yorku.ca">gtodd@yorku.ca</a>
<br>

PINE - one of the easiest to use mail clients around - does IMAP just
fine.  You can read mail from multiple servers and mailboxes and save
it locally or in remote folders on the servers - which is what IMAP is
all about: Internet Message Access Protocol = flexible and
configurable *access* to mail servers without having to pop and fetch
messages all over the place (but still having the ability save locally
if you want). 
</B>
<p><B>The Netscape's Communicator 4.0b2 thing does too but there are so many
other ugly bits that I'm not gonna bite.
</B>
<p><B>Jeez pretty soon with this fancy new IMAP stuff you'll be able to do
almost as much as you can right now with emacs and ange-ftp (which I
use regularly to access remote mail folders and boxes with out having
to login - it's all set up in .netrc).  

Of course the answer is almost always "emacs"  ....  BTW Linux
makes a GREAT program loader for emacs ;-)
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
 
 Seems kind of kludgey.  Besides -- does that 
 give you the main feature that's driving the creation
 of the IMAP/ACAP standards?  Does it let you 
 store your mail on a server and replicate that to 
 a couple of different machines (say your desktop and
 your laptop) so you can read and respond to mail "offline"
 and from *either* system?

<P><B><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

Yeah, more or less.  If you save the mail on your server to local
folders or make a local folder be /me@other.mail.host:/usr/spool/me.
Using ange-ftp to me seem exactly like IMAP in Pine or Netscape
communicator 4.0b2. Though apparently IMAP will update folders across
hosts so that only that mail deleted locally (while offline) will get
deleted on the remote host on the next login etc. etc. I don't know
much about IMAP's technical standard either but find I get equal mail
management capability from ange-ftp/VM. (equal to Pine and
Communicator so far).
</B>
<p><B>WARNING: In a week or so when I get time I'm gonna ask you a tricky
question about emacs and xemacs.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

  Feel free.  Of course I do know a bit more about emacs
  than I do about X -- so you may not like my answer much.

<P><B><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

Heh heh OK...


(comp.emacs.xemacs is silent on this).  Emacs running as emacs -nw in
a tty (i.e console or an xterm) runs fine and lets me use all the job
control commands (suspend/fg etc) but with Xemacs job control won't
work unless I'm running as root. That is if I'm running "xemacs" or
"xemacs -nw" in an xterm or at the console and do C-z and then once
I'm done in the shell I do "fg", xemacs comes back but the keyboard
seems to be bound to the tty/console settings (Ctrl-z Ctrl-s Ctrl-q
etc all respond as if I were in a dumb terminal).  The only recourse
is to Ctrl-z back out and kill xemacs. This does not happen if I run
xemacs setuid root (impractical/scary) or as root (scary).  Something
somewhere that requires root permission or suid to reset the tty
characteristics doesn't have it in xemacs - but does in emacs...

My only response so far has been that "you'll have to
rebuild/recompile your xemacs" - but surely this wrong. Does anything
more obvious occur to you? I feel it must be something simple in my
set up (RH Linux 2.0.29). Of course if I could get this fixed I'd
start feeling more comfortable not having GNU-Emacs on my machine ;-)
 which may not be an outcome you would favour.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	I once had a problem similar to this one -- suspending
	minicom would suspend the task and lock me out of it.

	It seemed that the ownership of the tty was being
	changed.

<p>	So -- the question comes up -- what permissions are set on
	your /dev/tty* nodes.  It  seems that most Linux distributions
	are set up to have the login process chown the these to to the 
	current user (and something seems to restore them during or after
	logout).

<p>	I don't know enough about the internals of this process.
	I did do a couple of experiments with the 'script' command
	and 'strace' using commands like:

	<pre>	strace -o /tmp/strace.script /usr/bin/script</pre>

<p>	... and eyeballing the trace file.  This shows how the
	script command (which uses a psuedo tty -- or pty) searches
	for an available device.

<p>	I then did a simple 'chown 600 /dev/ttyp*' as root
	(this leaves a bunch of /dev/ttyq* and /dev/ttyr nodes
	available).  The 'script' command then reports that 
	the system is "out of pty's."

<p>	Obviously the script command on my system don't 
	do a very thorough search for pty's.  It effectively
	only looks at the first page of them.

<p>	The next test I ran was to add a new line to my
	/etc/services file (which I called stracetel) -- and
	a new line to me /etc/inetd.conf that referred to it.

<p>	This line looks like this:
<pre>
stracetel  stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  \
	/usr/bin/strace -o /root/tmp/t.strace /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
</pre>
<p>	... all on one line, of course. 

<p>	Then I connected to that with the command:

	<pre>		telnet localhost stracetel</pre>

<p>	This gives me an strace of how telnetd handles the 
	allocation and preparation of a pty.  Here, as I suspected,
	I saw chown() and chmod() calls after telnetd did it's 
	search through to list of pty's to find the first one.

<p>	Basically both programs (and probably most other 
	pty clients) attempt to open each pty until one returns
	a valid file descriptor or handle.  (It might be nice
	if there was a system call or a daemon that would allow
	programs to just say "give me a pty" -- rather than forcing
	a flurry of failed open attempts -- but that's probably too
	much to ask for.

<p>	There result of these experiments suggests that there 
	are many ways of handling pty's -- and some of them may 
	have to be set as compile time options for your system.

<p>	It may be that you just need to make all the pty's 
	mode 666 (which they are on my system) or you might
	chgrp them to a group like tty or pty, make them mode 
	660 and make all the pty using programs on your system
	SGID.

<p>	I've noticed that all of my pty's are 666 root.root
	(my tty's  root.tty and ttyS*'s are root.uucp all are
	mode 660 and all programs that need to open them are 
	either root run (getty) or SGID as appropriate).

<p>	Some of the policies for ownership and permissions are 
	set my your distribution.  Red Hat 2.x is *old* and 
	some of these policies may have changed in the 3.03 and
	4.1 releases.  Mine is a 3.03 with *lots* of patches, 
	updated RPM's and manually installed tarballs.

<p>	Frankly I don't know *all* of the security implications
	of having your /dev/tty* set to mode 666.  Obviously 
	normal attempt to open any of these while they're in
	use return errors (due to the kernel locking mechanisms).
	Other attempts to access them (through shell redirection,
	for example) seem to block on I/O.  I suspect that a 
	program that improperly opened it's tty (failed to 
	set the "exclusive" flag on the open call) would be 
	vulnerable.

UUCP Questions

I had a couple minor questions on UUCP. If you have a few minutes, I'd
appreciate the help immensely. I'll tell you a little bit about what we're
doing.
</B><P>

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

Glancing ahead -- I'd guess that this would take quite a bit
more than a few minutes.

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>My company has a domain name registered (plconline.com) and two offices.
One is the branch office which is located in the city with the ISP. The
head office is kind of in the sticks in western Iowa. I've been
commissioned to find out how difficult it would be to set up the uucp so
the machine in Des Moines (the big city ;-) would grab all the domain mail
and then possibly make a subdomain like logan.plconline.com for all the
people in the main office to use email.
</B>
<p><B>This would all be running on RedHat 4 over dialup uucp. The system in Des
Moines uses uucp over tcp because it has to share the line with
masquerading, etc.
</B>
<p><B>Thanks for any advice or pointers you have.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif"><br>

Unfortunately I this question is too broad to answer
via e-mail.  O'Reilly has a whole book on uucp and 
there are several HOW-TO's for Taylor UUCP and 
sendmail under Linux.

<p>	My uucp mostly works but I haven't configured it to
run over TCP yet.  I also haven't configured my 
system to route to any uucp hosts within my domain.

<p>	You can address mail to a uucp host through a 
DNS by using the '%' operator.  For example I can
get my main mail system (antares.starshine.org) to 
forward mail to my laptop using an address like:

<pre>	jim%mercury@starshine.org</pre>

<p>	... the DNS MX record for starshine.org routes
mail to my ISP.  My ISP then spools it up in UUCP
until my machine (antares) picks it up.  The 
name antares is basically transparent to most of
this process.

<p>	When antares gets the mail it converts the 
percent sign into a "bang" (!) and spools it
for mercury (which happens to be my laptop).

<p>	Obviously requiring all of your customers and
correspondents to use percent signs in their addressing
to your users is not going to work very well.  It will
probably result in alot of lost mail, alot of complaints
and a constant barrage of support calls.

<p>	There are two ways to make your internal mail routing
transparent to the rest of world.  You can create a
master aliases list on your mail hub (the easy way) or
you can create DNS and MX entries for each of the hosts.

<p>	If you'd like more help we could arrange to talk on 
the phone.  UUCP is difficult to set up for the first
time (nearly vertical initial learning curve).  Once it's
set up it seems to be pretty low maintenance.  However
my meta-carpus can't handle explaining the whole process
via e-mail (and I don't understand enough of it well to 
be brief).

Using MS-DOS Floppies
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Barry, <a
href="mailto:remenyi@hotmail.com">remenyi@hotmailcom</a><br>            

Hi, I have a problem that I can't find the solution to:  
</B>
<p><B>I run Redhat 4.1 with mtools already installed, with it, I can copy a
file to or from a dos disk in A: with mcopy etc..
But if I change the disk & do mdir, it tells gives me the listing of
what was in the last disk.  The only solution is to wait hours for the
cache to expire before I can look at another disk.  
</B>
<p><B>The problem occurs no matter how I access the floppy, I also tried using
dosemu, and mount, but I have the same problem.  I can read and write
from the first disk that I put in with no problems, but if I change the
disk, the computer acts as if the first disk is still in the drive.  It
also doesn't matter who I am loged in as eg. root has the same problem. 
I also upgraded mtools to 3.3 but no change.
</B>
<p><B>Is there some way to disable the disk cache (I assume thats the problem)
for the floppy drive?
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

You probably have a problem with the "change disk" detection
circuitry on your floppy.

<p>	There's a pretty good chance that you'd see the same thing
under DOS too.

<p>	Unfortunately I don't know of an easy way to solve this 
problem.  You could try replacing the floppy ($30 or so)
the controller ($20 -- to ???) and/or the cable.

<p>	If that's not feasible in your case you could try something 
like a mount/sync/umount (on a temporary mount point).  
This might force the system to detect the new floppy.  It's 
very important not to try to write anything to a floppy when the
system is confused about which floppy is in there.

<p>	DOS systems that I have used -- while they were afflicted
with this problem -- sometimes severely trash the directories
on a diskette in that situation.

<p>	It probably doesn't even matter if the mount, sync, umount
that I describe fails -- just so the system is forced to 
"rethink" what's there.  I'd consider writing a short script
to do this -- put a temporary mount point that's "user" accessible
to avoid having to be root to do this (and especially to avoid
having to create any SUID root perl scripts or write a C wrapper
or any of that jazz).

<p>	Here's a sample line for your /etc/fstab:

<pre># /etc/fstab
/dev/fd0                  /mnt/tmp       umsdos  noauto,rw,user 0 0</pre>

<p>	(according to my man pages the "user" options should 
imply the nosuid, nodev etc. options -- which prevent
certain other security problems).

<p>	So your chdisk script might look something like:

<pre>	#! /bin/sh
	/bin/mount /mnt/tmp
	/bin/sync
	/bin/umount /mnt/tmp</pre>

<p>	... you could also just do a 'mount /mnt/tmp' or a 
'mount /mnt/a' or whatever you like for your system -- 
and just use normal Linux commands to work with those
files.  The mtools are handy sometimes -- but far from
indispensable on a Linux system with a good fstab 
file.

<p>	As a security note:  mount must be SUID in order to
allow non-root users to mount filesystems.  Since 
there have been security exploits posted on mount
specifically and various other SUID files chronically,
I suggest configuring mount and umount such that they 
can only be executed by members of a specific group
(like a group called "disk" or "floppy").  Then you 
can add yourself and any other users who have a valid
reason to work at your console to that group.  Finally
change the permissions on mount and umount to something 
like:

<pre>	-r-sr-x---  1  root    disk  .... /bin/mount</pre>

<p>	.... i.e. don't allow "other" to execute it.

<p>	This also applies to all your SVGALib programs (which
should not be executed except from the console) and
as many of your other SUID programs as you can.

<p>	(... it would be nice to do that to sendmail -- and
I've heard it's possible.  However it's a bit trickier
than I've had time to mess with on this system).

<p>	As PAM (pluggable authentication module) technology
matures you'll be able to configure your system to
dynamically assign group membership's based on 
time of day and source of login (value of `tty`).

<p>	This will be nice -- but it doesn't appear to be
quit ready yet.

BTW: which suggestion worked for you?  Replacing one or

<p>	Under DOS I used to use Ctrl-C, from the COMMAND.COM A:

inetd Questions
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Benjamin Peikes, <a href="mailto:benp@npsa.com">benp@npsa.com</a><br>

Answer guy,<br>

  I have two questions for you.
</B>
<p><B>	1) I'm using one machine with IPAliasing and was wondering if
   there is a version of inetd built so that you can have different
   servers spawned depending on the ip number connected to.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

That's an excellent question.

There is apparently no such feature or enhanced version of 
inetd or xinetd.

<p>	It also doesn't appear to be possibly to use TCP Wrapper
rules (tcpd, and the /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny)
to implement this sort of virtual hosting.

<p>	So far it appears that all of the support for virtual hosting 
is being done by specific applications.  Apache and some other
web servers have support for it.  The wu-ftpd's most recent 
versions support it.

<p>	I suspect that you could create a special version of 
inetd.conf to open sockets on specific local IP addresses
and listen on those.  I would implement that as a command 
line option -- passing it a regex and/or list of ip addresses
to listen on after the existing command line option to
specify which configuration file to use.  Then you'd load
different copies of this indetd with commands like:

<pre>	/usr/sbin/inetd /etc/inetd.fred 192.168.14.0 17.18.0.0 
/usr/sbin/inetd /etc/inetd.barney barneyweb
/usr/sbin/inetd /etc/inetd.wilma 192.168.2.3
</pre>
<p>	(This would be something like -- all of the 192.168.14.*
address and all of the 17.18.*.* addresses are handled by
the first inetd -- all of the access to a host named
barneyweb (presumably looked up through the /etc/hosts file)
would be handled by the next inetd. and all of the accesses
to the ipalias 192.168.2.3 would be handled by the last one)

<p>	This would allow one to retain the exact format of the 
existing inetd files.

<p>	However I don't know enough about sockets programming to 
know how much code this would entail.  The output of 
'netstat -a' on my machine here shows the system listening
on *:smtp and *:telnet (among others).  I suspect that those
stars would show up different if I had a socket open to 
a specific service on a specific service.

<p>	This scheme might use up to many file descriptors.  Another 
approach would be to have a modified tcpd.  This would have 
to have some option where by the destination *as well as*
the source was matched in the /etc/tcpd.conf file(s).

<p>		(Personally I think that tcpd should be compiled
	 with a change -- so that the single tcpd.conf
	 file is used in preference to the /etc/hosts.allow
	 and /etc/hosts.deny files.  Current versions do 
	 support the single conf file -- but the naming is
	 still screwy).

<p>	I'm not sure quite how Wietse would respond to this --
possibly by repeating the question:

<p>		"If you want me to add that -- what should I 
	take OUT?"

<p>	(which is what he said one to me when I suggested merging 
his chrootuid code with tcpd).

<p>	I've blind copied Wietse on this (Hi!).  I doubt he has
time to read the Linux Gazette. 
<P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>2) A related problem: I have one machine running as a mail server
   for several domains where the users are using pop to get their
   mail. The problem is that the From: line always has the name
   of the server on it. Is there a way to use IPaliasing to fix
   this? Or do I have to muck around with the sendmail.conf file?
</B><P>

<p>	This is becoming a common question.

<p>	Here's a couple of pointers to web sites and FAQ or HOWTO
documents that deal specifically with "Virtual Mail Hosting"
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sinbad.wantabe.com/virtualmail">How to Set up Sendmail for Virtual Domains</a>
<li><a href="http://www.qmail.org">qmail: A Replacement for Sendmail</a>
</ul>
<p>		   (look for references to "virtualdomains")

<p>	... and here's one guide to Virtual Web Hosting:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://inorganic5.fdt.net/ldp/HOWTO/mini/Virtual-Web">
Virtual Web Mini-HOWTO</a>       
</ul>
<P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>I guess the best way to do this would be to change inetd to figure 
out on which interface the connection has been made on and then 
pick the correct inetd.conf to reference, like
<pre>
inetd.conf.207.122.3.8
inetd.conf.207.122.3.90</pre>
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	I would recommend that as a default behavior.
	I suggested adding additional parameters to the 
	command line specifically because it could be done
	without breaking any backward compatibility.  The 
	default would be to simply work as it does now.

<p>	I still suspect that this has some scalability problems
	-- it might not be able to handle several hundred or several
	thousand aliased addresses.

<p>	I might still be useful to implement it as a variation of --
	or enhancement to -- tcpd (TCP_Wrappers).
<P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>I think that inetd reads in the configuration file when it 
starts because it needs a SIGHUP to force it to reread the conf 
file. All you would have to do is make it reference the right table.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	This is also documented in the inetd man page. 
<P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>Do you know where I could find the code? I would be interested 
in looking at it?
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	The source code from inetd should be in the bundle 
	of sources that comes with the "NetKit"

<p>	Look to:

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.inka.de/pub/comp/Linux/networking/NetTools/">ftp:..ftp.inka.de/pub/comp/Linux/networking/NetTools/</a>

<p>	and mirrored at: 

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/Networking/PROGRAMS/NetTools/>ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/Networking/PROGRAMS/NetToos/</a>

<p>	... this includes the history of it's development and the
	names of people who were active in it at various stages.

<p>	If you're going to try to hack this together -- I'd suggest
	a friendly posting to the comp.linux.development.system

Setting Up a Modem
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Yang, <a href="mailto:lftian@ms.fudan.edu.cn">lftian@ms.fudan..edu.cn</a>
</br>
	I have an AT 3300 card( from Aztech) which integrates the function of
sound card and 28.8K modem. It seems that it need a special driver for its
modem function to be work. In MSDOS, there is a aztpnp.exe for that
purpose. Do you know is there any way I can get the card work (at least its
modem function) in Linux?
</B><p>
<B>Tianming Yang
</B><P><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	I'm not familiar with that device.  The
	name of the driver suggests that this is a 
	Plug 'n Play (pnp) device (sometimes we use the
	phrase "plug and *pray*" -- as it can be a toss
	of the dice to see if they'll work as intended.

<p>	My guess would be that this is a  PCMCIA card 
	for a laptop system (which I personally pronounce
	"piecemeal"). 

<p>	Did you look in the "Hardware HOWTO" (start at 
	www.ssc.com, online mirror of FAQ's and HOWTO's)?

<p>	Did you go to Yahoo! and do a keyword search on 
	the string:

	<pre>		linux +aztech</pre>

<p>	... (the plus sign is important there)?

<p>	Since all of the real details about the configuration
	of the card are determined by the manufacturer
	(Aztech in this case) I would start by contacting
	them.

<p>	If they've never heard of Linux -- or express no
	interest in supporting it -- please consider letting
	them know that Linux support affects your purchasing 
	decisions.  Also let them know that getting support 
	for Linux is likely to cost them very little.
	

<p>	How to get a Linux driver for your hardware:

<p>		If you are a hardware company that would like
		to provide support for Linux and FreeBSD and other
		operating systems -- but you don't have the 
		development budget -- just ask.

<p>		That's right.  Go to the comp.os.linux.development.system
		newsgroups and explain that you'd like to provide 
		full documentation and a couple of units of your hardware
		to a team of Linux programmers in exchange for a freely
		distributable driver.  Be sure to make the sources for
		one of your other drivers (preferably any UNIX, DOS, or
		OS/2 driver) available to them.

<p>		If you don't like that approach, consider publishing the
		sources to your existing drivers.  If you are really in
		the hardware business than the benefits of diverse OS
		support should far outweigh any marginal "edge" you might
		get from not letting anyone see "how you do it."

<p>	(Just a suggestion for all those hardware vendors out there).

	The IP Address of any connecting client is provided

<B>my ip-gateway connects my inner lan over two token ring network cards
(sorry, not my idea!) with the internet (lan <-> tr0 <-> tr1 <->
internet). the masquerading forward roule of ipfwadm gives me the
possibility to indicate a source and a destination address.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Oh.  So all of the clients that you're interested in
	are on a private LAN and going through a masquerading/NAT
	server (network address translation).

<p>	I would try using ident for starters.  Run identd on your
	Masquerade Host and make calls to the ident service from
	your CGI scripts.  I don't think it will work -- but it 
	should be worth a little info.

<p>	From there you might be able to configure all the clients
	on the inner LAN to use an *applications* level proxy
	(squid -- formerly cached, CERN httpd, or the apache cache/
	proxy server).  Masquerading can be thought of as a 
	"network layer proxying services" while SOCKS, and similar
	services -- which work with the co-operation of the client
	software -- are applications layer proxies.

<p>	I don't know if the private net IP address or other info
	will propagate through any of these HTTP proxies.

<p>	If this is *really* important to you, you could consider
	writing your own "NAT Ident" service and client.  I don't
	know how difficult that would be -- but it seems like the
	code for the identd (and the RFC 931? spec) might give you
	a starting point for defining a protocol (you might want
	to secure that service under TCP_Wrappers).  You might want
	to consider making this a TCP "Multiplexed" service --
	look for info on tcpmux for details about that.

<p>	The gist of tcpmux is that it allows your custom client
	to talk to a daemon on TCP port 1 of the server host and
	ask for a service by name (rather than relying on 
	"Well-Known Port Addresses").  So, if you're going to create
	a new service -- it makes sense to put it under tcpmux
	so you don't pick your own port number for it -- and then 
	have the IANA assign that port to something else that you 
	might want later.
<P><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>do you see a possibility for an 'address assignment' between the two
interfaces? if you do please let me know.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	I don't know of any existing way to determine the IP
	address of a client on the other side of any NAT/masquerading
	host -- I'm not even sure if there's any existing way to do it
	for a client behind a SOCKS or TIS FWTK or other applications
	level proxy.

<p>	I'll be honest.  With most "Answer Guy" questions I 
	do some Yahoo!, Alta-vista and SavvySearch queries -- and
	ask around a bit (unless I already know the answer pretty
	well -- which doesn't happen all that often these days).
	I skipped that this time -- since I'm pretty sure that
	there's nothing out there that does this.

<p>	I welcome any corrections on this point.  I'll be happy
	to forward any refutations and corrections to Dani.

<p>	All of this begs the greater question:

<p>		What are you really trying to do?

<p>	If you are trying to provide some form of transparent 
	access control to your webserver (so local users can 
	see special stuff without using a "name and password")
	-- there are better ways available.

<p>	Netscape and Internet Explorer both support a form
	of client-certificate SSL -- which is supported at
	the server side by the Stronghold (commercial Apache)
	server.

<p>	As an alternative -- I'd look at the possibility of 
	finding or writing a Kerberos "auth" module for 
	Apache (and deploying Kerberos to the clients).
	This might be more involved than you're management
	is willing to go for -- but writing new variations of
	the indentd service might also fall into that category.
 
<p>	IP addresses are a notoriously bad form of access
	control.  If you have a properly configured set of
	anti-spoofing rules in the packet filters on your 
	router -- and you can show that no other routes exist
	into your LAN -- then you can base access controls to
	services (TCP/Wrappers) to about the granularity of
	"from here" and "not from here."  Attempting to read
	more into them than that is foolhardy.

<p>	Ethernet and Token Ring MAC (media access control) addresses
	(sometimes erroneously called "BIA's" -- burned in addresses)
	are just about as bad (most cards these days have options to
	over-ride the BIA with another MAC -- usually a feature of
	operating the card in "promiscuous" mode).

<p>	Yet another approach to the problem might be to simply
	put a web server on the internal LAN (no routing through
	the NAT/masquerading host) -- and use something like 
	rdist to replication/mirror the content between the 
	appropriate document trees on the internal and exterior
	web servers.

<p>	Basically we'd need to know much more about your
	requirements in order to give relevant recommendations.

Duplicating a Linux Installed HD
</h3><P> <B> 
From: Mohammad A. Rezaei, <a href="rezaei@tristan.TN.CORNELL.EDU">rezaei@tristan.TN.CORNELL.EDU</a><br>

I just read your response to duplicating a hard drive using dd.
I think using dd limits the uses of this technique too much. 
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	I absolutely agree.  I wonder where I suggested 'dd' 
	without expressing my misgivings.

<p>	Please consider quoting little portions of my posting
	when making references to them -- I write alot and 
	can't remember past postings without some context.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
<B>I have more than once installed/transfered entire hard drives using
tar. simply put both drives in the same machine, mount the new drive
in /mnt and do something like
<pre>
tar -c -X /tmp/excludes -f / | (cd /mnt; tar xvf -)
	The file....

/tmp/excludes should contain:

	/mnt
	/proc
 and any other non-local, mounted drives, such as nfs mount points.
</pre>
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	There are better ways to do this.

	One way is to use a command like:
<pre>
		find ... -xdev -type f | tar cTf - - | \
			(cd ... && tar xpf - )

	Another is to use:

		find ... | cpio pvum /new/directory

	... which I only learned after years of using 
	the tar | (cd ... && tar) construct.
</pre>

<p>	In both of these cases you can use find parameters
	to include just the files that you want.  (Note:
	with tar you *must* prevent find from printing any
	directory names by using the -type f (or more 
	precisely a \! -type d clause) -- since tar will
	default to tar'ing any directories named in a 
	recursive fashion).

<p>	The -T (capital "tee") option to GNU tar means to 
	"Take" a list of files as an "include" list.  It
	is the complement to the -X option that you list.

<p>	You can also pipe the output of your find through
	grep -v (or egrep -v) to filter out a list of 
	files that you want to exclude.
<P><B><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

finally, one has to install the drive onto the new machine,
boot from floppy and run lilo.
 
The disks don't have to be identical. the only disadvantage is having
to run lilo, but that's takes just a few minutes.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	The only message I can remember posting about 'dd' 
	had an extensive discussion of using tar and cpio for
	copying trees.

	Am I forgetting one -- or did you only get part of
	my message?

<P><B><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

Hope this helps.
</B><P>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Hopefully it will help some readers.  The issues of 
	copying file trees and doing differential and 
	incremental backups is one that is not well covered in
	current books on system administration.

<p>	When I do a full backup I like to verify that it
	was successful by extracting a table of contents or
	file listing from the backup media.  I then keep a
	compressed copy of this.  Here I use tar:
<pre>
		tar tf /dev/st0 | gzip > /root/tapes.contents/.....
</pre>
<p>	.... where the contents list is named something like:
<pre>
		antares-X.19970408
</pre>
<p>	.... which is a hostname, a volume (tape) number and a 
	date in YYYYMMDD format (for proper collation -- sorting).

<p>	To do a differential I use something like:

	<pre>	find / -newer /root/tape.contents/....  \
			| egrep -v "^(/tmp|/proc|/var/spool/news)" \
			| tar czTf - /mnt/mo/diff.`date +%Y%m%d`.tar
</pre>
<p>	... (actually it's more complicated than that since
	I build the list and compute the size -- and do some 
	stuff to make sure that the right volume is on the 
	Magneto Optical drive -- and mail nastygrams to myself
	if the differential won't fit on that volume -- if the
	volume is the most recent one (I don't overwrite the 
	most recent -- I rotate through about three generations)
	-- etc).

<p>	However this is the core of a differential backup.
	If you wanted an incremental -- you'd supply a different
	file to the -newer switch on your find command.

<p>	The difference between differential and incremental is 
	difficult to explain briefly (I spent about a year 
	explaining it to customers of the Norton Backup).  Think of
	it this way:

<p>		If you have a full -- you can just restore that.

<p>		If you have a full, and a series of differentials,
		you can restore the most recent full, and the
		most recent differential (any older fulls or differentials
		are unneeded)

<p>		If you have a full and a series of incrementals you 
		need to restore the most recent full, and each 
		subsequent incremental -- in order until the most 
		recent.

<p>	It's possible (even sensible in some cases) to use a 
	hybrid of all three methods.  Let's say you have a large
	server that takes all day and a rack full of tapes to do a 
	full backup.  You might be able to do differentials for 
	a week or two on a single tape per night.  When that fills
	up you might do an incremental, and then go back to 
	differentials.  Doing this to a maximum of three incrementals
	might keep your all day backup marathons down to once a month.
	The restore must go through the "hierarchy" of media in the
	correct order -- most recent full, each subsequent incremental 
	in order, and finally the most recent differential that was
	done after that.

<p>	(Personally, I avoid such complicated arrangements like the 
	plague.  However they are necessary in some sites.)

<H2>CLUELESS at the Prompt: A Column for New Users<\H2>
<H4>By Mike List,
<a href="mailto:troll@net-link.net">troll@net-link.net</a>
</center>
<P> <HR> <P> 

<center><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC = "../gx/list/gnub.jpg" ></center>
<p>
<h4>Welcome to installment 4 of Clueless at the Prompt: 
a new column for new users.</h4>

<hr>
<p><h4> Connecting to a Second ISP...or Third, or</h4>
 I recently got e-mail from a guy who wanted to know how to connect to a
second ISP.His e-mail address apparently wasn't valid, and it got bounced
back several times. Just as well, since I didn't have the answer at that
point. Well, I got this idea, and I tried it and it works.Here's the deal:
 First,
<pre> cp /usr/sbin/ppp-on to /usr/sbin/ppp-on.anysuffix
</pre><p>
Then open the file you just created with a text editor, and change any
information that applies to the secondary ISP, eg. dialup, the IP number
of the ISP, username and password. write the file(save it) and try your
new executable, ppp-on.anysuffix. Just a quick pointer, you could call
your new script any name you want as long as there's no other file with
the same name in your path,preferably no other file with the same name at
all
<hr>
<h4> Dealing With a Dynamic IP</h4>
<p>
These days most Internet Service Providers assign you a Dynamic IP when
you logon to their network, due to the cost of assigning every customer
a static IP. At present there are only so many IP addresses available
and, apparently each one costs to register. Consequently ISPs buy a pool
of IP addresses within a range and assign an available one at login. For
most uses, such an arrangement is no problem, assuming that most
internet usage consists of interaction between the ISP's computer and
the local one. For some purposes, however such as allowing telnet or ftp
to your computer the dynamic scheme is less than ideal. Here's
a relatively painless way to get your current IP, so you can run with
the big dogs. Open an xterm, or rxvt and type:
<pre> ifconfig</pre><p>
which will bring up some info in two blocks. You'll want to note the
bottom block, which will have a line that specifies your inet address
expressed numerically. It will be in a xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format, which
corresponds to the standard IP address, in fact that's what it is.
you ca write this number down or just highlight this IP address(to paste
it)and type:
<pre>nslookup the.num.ber.</pre><p>
the number being your inet address from the last step.
It may take a couple of minutes, but you will get a two line messagethat
looks like:<pre>Name:   your Fully Qualified Domain Name
                Address: IPa.ddr.ess.!!! </pre><p>
we may talk about FQDN some more another time, but for the purpose at
hand, just type:
<pre>hostname Name</pre><p>
where Name is the first line from the above step. That's it, except that
you must repeat this procedure every time you connect to your ISP. You
might be able to write a script to automate this procedure, but in the
meantime which as my friend Al used to say "is a groovy time", you can
use this knowledge to run remote X apps(just a minute,I'm coming to that)
allow your friends or inet associates to telnet to your computer, or ftp
files from a telnetted site(this too, momentarily).What you need to know
is that the next time youreboot, you may get a message saying that your
computer name is "bad". This isn't a comment on your lack of originality
or taste, and you should basically ignore it.
<hr>
<h4>Using your Domain Name</h4>
If you have a shell account at a computer located at a university or
school near you, this will amaze you. Oh yeah not, by way of a plug, but
there is a semi commercial telnet box called linuxware.com(you will have
to look up the URL yourself semi- plug, you might say, I'm a subscriber)
What am I talking about? Using X to run apps from the remote computer on
your screen. You can actually run a program that isn't installed on your
computer, in X with the remote computer supplying the program. I think
it embodies the essence of networking, with permissions set right, you
can co-author a document, play a  multi-user game (MUD)use a
talkprogram, like ytalk, or do office or school work from your home
computer.Here's what you need to do. First, you need to know and have 
your FQDN listed by typing:
<pre>hostname</pre><p>
as detailed above. If you have a static IP address, you can skip this
step.What needs to be done next is to type:
<pre>xhost + the.telnet.box</pre><p>
When you hit enter you will see a message like, "the.telnet.box has been
added to the control list". You will probably have to restart your window 
manager, your mileage may, as they say, vary. Now when you start a
telnet session, you can enter the name of an X application and in a
moment, the application window will apear on your screen, even if you
don't have it installed on your computer. Do your work, play your game,
and marvel at the ramifications of this capability.
<p> You can also invite friends and coworkers over to your computer to
do some work, socialize or learn something, in the following manner.
Obtain your FQDN, or IP address, as detailed above. E-mail it to them or
call them on the phone to let them know where you are today(Not where
you want to go today, that's another "OS"). they can then:
<pre> telnet FQDN  or  ftp IPa.ddr.ess.!!!</pre><p>
and all of a sudden they're in your den, or office or wherever you keep
your computer. For more sophisticated methods of getting your address,
read the "Dynamic IP hacks-HOWTO. 
   
  
<h4>Just a Reminder: Read the whole Linux Gazette</h4>
<p>This esteemed tabloid is just full of novice- to intermediate level
tips and tricks.The Answer Guy, Two Cent Tips, and The Weekend Mechanic
in particular, are good sources of the kinds of things that will make you
a demi-guru in no time at all. 
<hr>
<h4>Formatting Floppy Disks in Linux</h4>
<p>In DOS and Windows,formatting a floppy disk is a one shot affair
which formats, erases data, and creates a file system on the floppy.
In linux however, you have to format and create the filesystem in
separate steps. At first glance, this seems backward, after all, isn't
linux a more sophisticated OS? Why do things in two steps that the others
do in one? The reason is that linux can read several filesystems so that
data can be moved from one OS to the other. By mounting the floppy drive
as MSDOS, VFAT, or other filesystem type the data can be read from the
mount point in a manner that linux can make use of.
<hr>
<h4>Other Stuff I've Collected/Found out Since Last Time</h4>
<p>have trouble with the 
<pre> find </pre><p>command?Try leaving your computer on overnight, and
the next day use the <pre>locate /filename |less</pre><p>command instead.
Locate is a database that is gathered during idle times on your computer
Actually locate reads a database that is updated by a command in your
system files, but if you give it time to breathe, usually overnight, it
can locate any file on your hard drive(s). You can also try 
<pre> whereis filename </pre><p>
and you will get a location for the named file.
 <hr>           
 Next Time- Let me know what you would like to see in here and I'll
try to
oblige just e-mail <a href="mailto:troll@net-link.net">troll@net-link.net</a>
me and ask, otherwise I'll just write about what gave me trouble and
how I got past it.</p>

<P> In this article I will describe a configuration tool called The Dotfile
Generator (TDG for short). TDG is a configuration tool, which configures
programs, using X11 widgets like check boxes, entries, pull-down menus etc.<p>

For TDG to configure a given program a module must be made for it. At the
moment modules exist for the following programs: Bash, Fvwm1, Fvwm2, Emacs,
Tcsh, Rtin and Elm.<p>

The article will describe common use of TDG, so if you do not have it yet,
it might be a good idea to <a
href="ftp://ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile/dotfile.tar.gz">download
it</a> (It's free!) You may also go to <a
href="http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile/">the home page of the
Dotfile Generator</a> for further information.




<p><hr><center><h1>Intro</h1></center>
The UNIX system, was developed many years ago, long before
graphical user interfaces became commonplace. This means that most of the applications
today work fine without a graphical user interface. Examples of this are
editors and shells.<p>

A basic concept in UNIX is that the programs are very configurable. Here is
an example from Emacs, which shows this:<p>

<blockquote>
<i>What should be done if the user asks to go to the next line at the of</i>
a file?<br>
There are two logical 
possibilities: <ol>
  <li> Insert a blank line, and move to it.
  <li> Beep, to tell the user that there is no next line.
</ol>

Instead of implementing only one of the solution the people behind Emacs,
have chosen to implement both, and let you decide which one you prefer.
</blockquote>

Since the program works without a GUI, the standard method for
configuring such options is to use a <i>dot-file</i>. In this file, you
may <i>program</i>, which method you will use.<p>

This solution, however, requires that the user has to learn the programming
language used in the dot-file, and has to read lots of documentation to
find out which configurations can be made. This task may be difficult and
tedious, and for that reason many users often choose to use the default
configuration of the program.<p>

If you take a look at some dot-files, you may find 
that most of the configurations can be described by the following items:
<ul>
  <li> Configurations with two possibilities (like above)
  <li> Configuration, where the program wishes to know a number or text.
       Examples of this could be questions like: <i>how many times should
       one press CTRL-d to quit</i>, and <i>email address to use in
       reply-to field</i>.
  <li> Configuration, where the user may choose an option from a list, eg:<br>
       <i>which editor would you like to use: emacs, jed, vi or vim</i>
</ul>

The configurations above may easily be done with a GUI, with the following
widgets in order: A check box, an entry and a pull down menu.

This is exactly what is done in TDG.



<p><hr><center><h1>The basic concept of TDG</h1></center>

TDG is a tool, which configures other programs (eg. emacs,bash and fvwm)
with widgets as those described above, and many more. The widgets are
placed in groups, which makes it easy to find the correct configuration
without having seen it before. And most important of all, help is located
at the configuration of each option, instead of in a manual far away. To get
help, you just press the right mouse button on the widget, which contains
the configuration you want to know more about!<p>

When you start TDG, you will be offered a list of standard configurations,
where you may pick one to start out with. This may be convenient, if you do
not have a dot-file for the given program, or if you would like to try a
new configuration. If on the other hand, you already have a dot-file, which
you would like to put the finishing touches to, you may read this file into
TDG. Note, however, that it is not all modules, which have the capability
to read the dot-file (the fvwm2, rtin and elm modules have, the other
modules do not, since it would be to complicated to create such a
parser.)<p>

When you have selected a start-up configuration, the menu-window will be
displayed (see figure 1). In this window, you can travel through the
configuration pages, just like a directory structure. If you select a
page, a new window will be displayed, with the configuration for this page
(see figure 2). This window will be reused for all the configuration pages,
ie. only one configuration page is visible at a time, so you do not have
to destroy the window yourself.<p>

<table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=4 cols=2 width=100%>
<tr>
<td align=top>
<center><img width=294 height=196 src="../gx/pedersen/menu_window.jpg"><p>Figure 1</center>

<td align=top>
<center><img width=399 height=203 src="../gx/pedersen/config_page.jpg"><p>Figure 2</center>
</table>

In region 1, the actual configuration is located. Region 2 is the help
region. In this region help for the whole page is shown, when the window is
displayed. It's also here, help for the individual configuration is
shown, when you press the right mouse button on one of the widgets.<p>

In region 3, information is shown on what will be generated. You have
three possibilities:
<ol>
  <li> You may generate all pages. This is the most natural thing to do,
       when you just want a configuration for a given program.

  <li> You may generate just the page shown. This is useful if you are
       plying around with TDG to see what will be generated for the
       different configurations.

  <li> Finally you may tell TDG, to just generate some of the pages, which
       is done with radio buttons in this region.
</ol>

In the <tt>Setup</tt>-><tt>Options</tt> menu, you may select which of the
three methods above will be used.<p>

When you have done all the configurations, you have to tell TDG which file
you wish to generate. This is done from the Options menu
(<tt>Setup</tt>-><tt>Options</tt>). And now it's time to create the actual
dot-file, which is done by selecting <tt>Generate</tt> in the <tt>File</tt>
menu.<p>

Once you have generated the dot-file, you may find that you would like some
of the configuration to be different. You could now go to the configuration
page in question, change your configuration, and then generate once again. If,
however, you are testing several different options for a single
configuration (ie. several items from a pull-down menu) you may find it
cumbersome to generate the whole module over and over again. In this
situation, you may chose <tt>Regenerate this page</tt> in the <tt>File</tt>
menu. Note, however, that if some part of the configurations on the page effects
other pages, these will not be generated, so in these situation
you have to generate the whole module.<p>

To see how to use the generated dot-file, please go to the <tt>Help</tt>
menu, and select the <tt>How to use the output</tt> item.




<p><hr><center><h1>The configuration widgets</h1></center>

TDG uses a lot of widgets to let you configure the different options. Some
of them are well known from other applications and include: check boxes,
radio buttons, pull-down menus, entries, text boxes (for multi-line text),
directory and file browsers. Others, however, are specifically designed for use
in TDG, and they will be described in the following.


<p><center><h2>The ExtEntry widget</h2></center>

The ExtEntry is a container, which repeats its elements, just like a
list-box repeat labels. A number of the elements in the ExtEntry may be
visible on the screen at a time. The elements in the ExtEntry may be any of
the widgets from TDG (ie. check boxes, pull-down menus and even other
ExtEntries.) One element in an ExtEntry is called a tuple.

In Figure 3, you can see an ExtEntry from the Tcsh module.<p>


<center>

Figure 3
</center><p>

This ExtEntry has three visible tuples, though only two of them contain
values (you can see, that the third one is grayed out).  To add a new tuple
to the ExtEntry, you have to press the button in the lower right corner,
just below the scroll bar. If the ExtEntry contains more tuples than can be
shown in it, you may scroll to the other tuples with the scroll bar.<p>

If you press the left mouse button on one of the scissors, a menu
with four elements will be displayed. These elements are used to cut, copy
and paste tuples within the ExtEntry.<p>

If the tuples get very large, only one of them may be shown on the screen
at a time. An example of that is seen in figure 4.<p>

When the tuples contain many widgets, scrolling the ExtEntry becomes
slow. In these cases, the ExtEntry may have a quick index. In figure 4, you
can see the quick index at the top of the ExtEntry (it's the button labeled
Idx.) When this quick index is invoked, a pull-down menu is display with
the values of the element associated with the quick index. This makes it much
easier to scroll the ExtEntries.<p>

</table>



<p><center><h2>The FillOut widget</h2></center>

Every shell has a configuration option called <tt>Prompt</tt>. This option
is some text, which will be printed, when the shell is ready to execute a
new command. In this text special tokens may be inserted, and when the
prompt is printed, these tokens will be replaced, with some information from
the shell. Eg. in Bash <tt>\w</tt> will be expanded to the current working
directory.<p>

In TDG, a special widget has been created called a <tt>FillOut</tt>, which
does configurations like the above. In Figure 5, you can see a FillOut
widget from the Bash module. At the top of the widget there is an entry,
where you can type ordinary text. Below it, the tokens are placed. If you
select one of the tokens, it is inserted in the entry at the point of the
cursor. Some of the tokens may even have some additional
configurations. Eg. the token <tt>Current working directory</tt> has two
possible options: <tt>Full directory</tt>, and <tt>only the last part</tt>. When tokens with
additional configurations are selected, a window will be displayed, where
these configurations can be done. If you wish to change such a configuration,
press the left mouse button on the token in the entry.




<p><center><h2>The Command widgets</h2></center>

TDG can be extended by the module programmer through the Command
widget. This makes it possible to configure specific options with widgets
they have developed themseves. At the moment three such widgets exist: The
directory/file browser, the color widget and the font widget.<p>

The widgets will appear as a button within TDG, and when the button is
pressed a new window will be displayed, where the actual configuration is done.



<p><hr><center><h1>Save, Export and Reload</h1></center>
When you have configured the different options in TDG, you may wish to
leave it, and come back later, and change some of the configurations. When
you leave TDG, you may save your changes, which you do from the
<tt>File</tt> menu.<p>

Next time you enter TDG, your saved file will be one of the the files you
will be offered as a start-up configuration.<p>

One important point you have to note is that this <tt>save file</tt> is an
internal dump of the state of TDG. This means that this file dependson
the version of TDG and the module. This means that if you wish to send a
given configuration to another person, this format is not appropriate. A
version independent format exists, which is called the <i>export
format</i>. To create such a file, you have to select <tt>Export</tt>
instead of <tt>Save</tt> in the <tt>File</tt> menu.<p>

Sometimes you may wish to restore the configuration on a single page, to its
value as it was before you started playing around with it, or you may wish
to merge another person's configuration with your own. This is done by selecting
<tt>Reload</tt> in the <tt>File</tt> menu. To tell TDG that you only want
to reload some of the pages, you have to select the <tt>Detail</tt> button
in the load window. This will bring up a window, where you can select which
configuration pages, you wish to reload. Here you can also tell it how you
want the pages to be reloaded. You have two possibilities:
<dl>
  <dt> Overwrite
  <dd> The pages you are loading, will totally overwrite the
       contents of the file
  <dt> Merge
  <dd> Tuples in the ExtEntries will be appended to those which already
       exist in the module. Other configurations will be ignored in the file.
</dl>

Here's another difference between the save-files and the export-files: You
cannot merge with save-files. This means that if you have a save-file,
which you wish to merge with, you first have to load it, export it, and
then you can merge with it.

	What a month.  Actually, two months.  Last month I was busily working
	on putting together an entry for the IRTC using BMRT.  At the same time
	I was trying to teach myself enough about the RenderMan Interface
	Specification to put together the second of three articles on BMRT.  
	I didn't succeed in the latter and ended up postponing the article 
	by one month.  Because I did this 
	I was able to focus more on learning the interface and worry less 
	about writing.  I think this strategy worked.  The scene I rendered for this 
	months IRTC is the best I've ever done and I managed to gain enough
	experience to write a meaningful article on the RenderMan Shading Langauge.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	One of the reasons I enjoy doing this column is because it exposes me to
	all sorts of people and software.  The world of computer graphics for
	Linux is constantly growing and the software constantly improves.  I
	hear about new products just about once or twice a week now and I hear
	about updates to existing packages all the time.  Its very difficult to
	keep track of all the changes (and the fact that I haven't made any updates
	to the Linux Graphics mini-Howto in some time reflects this) but I enjoy
	the work.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Since things change so often I have found its never clear how many 
	announcements I'll have for any one month.  Its gone from famine to 
	feast - with this month being the feast.  Most of the announcements in
	this months column are from April alone.  I don't know what happened -
	maybe all the bad weather around the globe kept people inside and busily
	working and now that the suns out they're starting to let loose what
	they've done.  I only wish I had the time to examine everything, to play
	with them all.  But my employer would rather I finish my current project
	first.  Has something to do with keeping my salary, so they say.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	In this months column I'll only be covering two related items.  The
	first is a case study on learning to use BMRT.  When you submit an image in
	the IRTC you are required to submit an ASCII text file describing your
	image and, to some extent, how you created it.  Some people don't put much
	work into this.  I just about wrote a book.  Since the information I
	provided covered more than just BMRT I thought it would be relavent to this
	column.  

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	The second item is the long awaited (well, I waited a long time to
	finish it anyway) 2nd article on BMRT that covers the RenderMan Shading
	Language.  I think this article came out quite good.  I've included quite a
	few samples and some general explanations on what they do.   I want to
	say right up front that I couldn't have done this without lots of help from
	BMRT's author, Larry Gritz at Pixar.  He was a very willing teacher and
	critic who offered many tips and ideas for my IRTC entry.  Most of that
	also ended up in this article.  Many thanks, Larry.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	I know I said I'd do an HF-Lab article this month too, but that IRTC
	entry took more time than I expected.  It was quite addicting, trying
	to get things just right.  I have started to review HF-Lab once again
	and will make it my first priority for next months column.  I've already
	figured out how to use the output from HF-Lab to produce height fields with
	BMRT.  Its quite simple really.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy this months
	articles.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Note:  I've been asked by a couple of readers about support for 3D
	hardware support in the various X servers.  I'm going to contact the
	X Server vendors (Xi Graphics, MetroLink, The XFree Project) 
	as well as Brian Paul (the MesaGL author)
	and see what they have to say.  If you are connected with these folks
	and have some insight I'd love to hear what you have to say.  Please
	<A HREF="mailto:mjhammel@csn.net">email me</A> if you know if such
	support is forthcoming and I'll include it in an upcoming Graphics
	Muse column.

		WebMagick Image Web Generator
		</H4> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		WebMagick is a package which supports making image collections available
		on the Web. It recurses through directory trees, building HTML pages,
		imagemap files, and client-side/server-side maps to allow the user to
		navigate through collections of thumbnail images (somewhat similar to
		xv's Visual Schnauzer) and select the image to view with a mouse click.
		
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		WebMagick is based on the "PerlMagick" ImageMagick PERL extension rather
		than external ImageMagick utilities (as its predecessor "Gifmap" is). This
		alone is good for at least a 40% performance increase on small images.
		WebMagick supports smart caching of thumbnails to speed montage generation
		on average size images. After a first pass at "normal" speed, successive
		passes (upon adding or deleting images) are 5X to 10X faster due to the
		caching.
		 
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		WebMagick supports a very important new feature in its caching subsystem:
		it can create and share a thumbnail cache with John Bradley's 'xv' program.
		This means that if you tell 'xv' to do an update, WebMagick montages will
		benefit and you can run WebMagick as a batch job to update xv's thumbnails
		without having to wait for 'xv' to do its thumbnail reduction (and get a
		browsable web besides!).
		
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		WebMagick requires the ImageMagick (3.8.4 or later) and PerlMagick (1.0 or
		later) packages as well as a recent version of PERL 5.

		<I>Q: Can anyone tell me how I would go about defining a height field
				according to a specific set of data points?
				My goal is to be able to take a topographic map, overlay it with a
				rough grid, and use the latitude, longitude, and elevation markings
				as points in a definable 3-D space to create a height field roughly
				equal to real topography.
		</I>
		<P>A: The easiest way is probably to write a PGM file.
			I wouldn't use longitude and latidude because the length of one degree
			isn't fixed and it will give reasonable results only near the equator.
			Use UTM coordinates or superimpose any arbitrary grid on your map
			which represents approximate squares.

		<I>Q: I've been fiddling with some simple CSG using BMRT and have run
			into a problem.  I'm trying to cut a square out of a plane that
			was created from a simple bilinear patch.  Whatever I use to define the
			square (a box actually) comes out white instead of the background color
			(black in this case).  I dont know what I'm doing wrong and was
			wondering if someone might take a peek at this for me.
		</I>
		<P>A: 
			There are several problems with your RIB file, as well as your use
			of CSG.  The two biggies are:

			<P>You just can't do this:

			<PRE>
            ObjectBegin 2
               SolidBegin "primitive"
               TransformBegin
                  Translate -1 0 0
                  Rotate -90 0 1 0
                  Patch "bilinear" "P" 
                     [ -1 -1 0   1 -1 0 
                       -1  1 0   1  1 0  ]
               TransformEnd
               ... etc.
            ObjectEnd
			</PRE>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		Transformations just aren't allowed inside object definitions.
		Remember that object instances inherit the entire graphics state
		that's active when they are instanced -- including transformations.
		So all primitives within the instanced object get the very same
		transformation.  If they're all bilinears like you have them, that
		means that they will all end up on top of one another.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		For this reason and others, I urge everybody to <I>not use instanced
		objects at all</I> for any RenderMan compliant renderer.  They're quite
		useless as described in the RenderMan 3.1 spec.
		Yes, I know that <B>RenderMan Companion</B> has an example that does
		exactly what I said is illegal.  The example is wrong, and will not
		work with either PRMan or BMRT.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		Solid (CSG) operations are meant only to operate on <I>solids</I>.
		A solid is a boundary representation which divides space into three
		distinct loci: (a) the boundary itself, which has finite surface area,
		(b) a (possibly disconnected) region of finite volume (the "inside"),
		and (c) a connected region of infinite volume (the "outside").
		You can't subtract a box from a bilinear patch, since a bilinear patch
		isn't a solid to begin with.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		If you want a flat surface with a square hole, there are two methods
		that I'd recommend:  (a) simply use several bilinears (4 to be exact)
		for the surface, like this:

<PRE>
            +-----------------------+
            |  #1                   |
            |                       |
            +======+---------+======+
            |      |         |      |
            | #2   |  (hole) | #3   |
            |      |         |      |
            +======+---------+======+
            |  #4                   |
            |                       |
            +-----------------------+
</PRE>

		Or, (B) if you really want to be fancy, use a single flat order 2
		NURBS patch with an order 2 trim curve to cut out a hole.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		This past 2 months I've been hard at work on an entry for this
		round of the IRTC, the Internet Ray Tracing Competition.  In 
		previous rounds I had submitted entries using POV-Ray, but for
		this round I switched to BMRT, mostly so I could learn the RenderMan
		API and how to write shaders using the RenderMan shading language.
		This months main article is the second of a three part series on 
		BMRT.  The BMRT package is written by Larry Gritz, and Larry was
		gracious enough to offer some wonderful critiques and tips on 
		my image.  
		
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		During out email correspondence, Larry noticed I had overlit my
		scenes quite badly.  While we tried to figure out what was causing
		this (it turned out to be a misuse of some parameters to some 
		spotlights I was using) he asked if I had gamma corrected for my
		display.  Gamma correction is a big issue in computer graphics, one
		that is often overlooked by novices.  I'd heard and read quite a 
		bit about gamma correction but had never really attempted to determine
		how to adjust the gamma for my display.  Larry offered an explanation,
		a quick way to test the gamma on my system, and a tip for 
		adjusting for gamma correction directly in the BMRT renderer, rendrib.
		I thought this would be a great thing to share with my readers, so
		here it is.
		
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Rendrib produces linear pixels for its output -- i.e. a pixel with
		value 200 represents twice as much light as a pixel of value 100.
		Thus, it's expected that your display will be twice as bright
		(photometrically, not necessarily perceptually) on a pixel of 200
		than one of 100.
		
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		This sort of display only really happens if you correct for gamma, 
		the nonlinearity of your monitor.  In order to check this,
		take a look at the following chart.  Display the chart as you'd
		view any image.  You'll notice that if you squint, the apparent
		brightness of the left side will match some particular number on
		the right.  This is your gamma correction factor that must be
		applied to the image to get linear response on your particular
		monitor.
		
		</td>

<tr>
	<td valign=top width="54%">
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If your display program uses Mesa (as rendrib's framebuffer display
		does), you can set an environment variable, MESA_GAMMA, to this value
		and it will transparently do the correction as it writes pixels to the
		screen.  Most display programs let you correct gamma when you view
		an image, though I've had trouble getting xv to do it without messing 
		up the colors in a weird way.
		
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Another alternative is to put the following line in your RIB file:
		
<PRE>
          Exposure 1 &ltgamma&gt
</PRE>

		This will cause rendrib to pre-correct the output pixels for the
		gamma of your display.  
		I think it's important to gamma correct so that at least you're
		viewing the images the way that rendrib "expects" them to appear.
		It can't know about the nonlinearities of your CRT without you
		telling it.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Readers should note that the image displayed in this article may

</H4>
</A>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One reason I took so long to get down to writing the Muse column this month
was that I was hard at work on an entry in the IRTC, the Internet Relay
Tracing Competition, which I help administer.  I've been an active
participant in the IRTC since its restart back in May 1996 but have only
actually entered one competition.   So this round had a special meaning for
me.  I don't often have the time to work on entries unless something else
suffers.  In this case, it was last months Muse column.  To be honest,
however, I was also using this entry to learn more about RenderMan, BMRT
and in particular, the RenderMan Shading Language.  Nothing is quite such a
a teacher as experience.  And my entry in the IRTC was a wonderful teacher.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Below I've included the text file which accompanies my entry in the
IRTC.  All entries must have this file.  It describes the who/what/how and
so forth relating to an entry.  I'll let the text file describe what I did,
who helped me do it, and some of the issues I encountered.  I hope you find
this useful information.

<B>IMAGE DESCRIPTION:</B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Pretty simplistic, really.  Its a school room, just after detention has let
out.  You can tell that detention has let out by the writing on the chalk
board and the time displayed by the clock on the wall.  The sun is starting
to get low outside, which causes the types of shadows you can see on the
bookshelf.  All the students who were in detention are required to read the
latest New York Times bestseller titled "Post Detention".  Its written by
some author who is rumored to do 3D graphics on the side.  You can see the
book on the desk in the lower right corner of the image.

<P>
<B>DESCRIPTION OF HOW THIS IMAGE WAS CREATED:</B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I used this image to learn to use RenderMan and BMRT.  I find I like these
tools a bit better than POV-Ray, mostly because I can write C code to
create models if I want (although I didn't for this particular scene) and
the shader language allows a bit more control than POV's.  I still have
much to learn to make real use of these features, however.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I started with some canned models from 3DCafe:  a chair, a couple of
bookcases, and some books.  I had to convert the chair from 3DS to DXF so I
could then import it into AC3D.  Once I had it in the modeler, I broke the
chair into two pieces - the arm and the rest of the chair.  I did this so I
could texture them seperately (note that in the 3DS format these pieces may
have already been seperate, but after the conversion to DXF they were a
single entity).  I also sized the chair to be a common unit size and 
centered it on the origin.  This unit size was used on all models so that 
the real sizing and positioning could be done in the RIB file.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The book case only needed resizing but the books had to be broken into a
cover and "text pages".  The latter are a single entity that were textured
with a matte finish.  The covers were textured individually.  All the books
are basically the same book sized differently and placed in the bookcase
from within AC3D.  This provided relative positioning for the books in the
bookcase, after which any other translations would maintain that relative
positioning.  Books on the chairs or floor were done similarly.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The walls are simple polygons or bilinear patches.  The windowed wall
turned out to show problems in the way AC3D does polygons for RIB output.
I had to convert this wall from polygons to a set of bilinear patches (see
the May issue of the Graphics Muse for 
<A HREF="gm.html#rib-csg">how to make a hole in a wall using bilinear 
patches</A>) 
in order for the texture to be applied evenly over all of
the patches.  This problem also showed up when trying to apply texture maps
to the chalk board.  It apparently has to do with vertex ordering.  I had
to change the chalkboard to a bilinear patch too.  I may have to write my
own models for anything that uses texture maps in the future instead of
using AC3D.  To his credit, I haven't told Andy (AC3D's author) about this
yet and he's been very good about addressing any problems I've found in the
past.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An important aspect of this image is the tremendous help I got from Larry
Gritz, the author of BMRT.  He offered some special shaders, although I
only used one of them (the one for the ceiling tiles).  The biggest help
was very constructive criticism and tips for things too look for in my
code.  For example, he pointed out that I was probably using the parameters
to spotlights incorrectly.  I was, and it was causing my scene to be
<I>very</I>
overlit (spotlights use coneangle in radians, and I had specified them in
degrees).  This one change made a dramatic improvement in the overall
image.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
All the shaders used, except for the ceiling tiles and the papers on the
desks, are from the archive of shaders from Guido Quaroni.  This archive
includes shaders from the RenderMan Companion by Steve Upstill, from
Texturing and Modeling by Ebert, Musgrave, et al, Larry Gritz, and various
other places.  Its quite a useful resource for novices just getting started
with shaders and RenderMan.  The papers on the desks are textured with a
shader I wrote that creates the horizonatl and vertical lines.  It also
puts in 3 hole punches, but thats not obvious from the image.  This shader
is the only one I included in the source [Ed. The IRTC allows the source
code for scenes to be uploaded along with the JPEG images and text file].  
The chairs are textured with a
rusty metallic shader and a displacement shader for the dents.
Displacement shaders are cool because they actually move points on the
surface (unlike bump maps which just change the normals for those points).
The arm surfaces are textured with a wood shader that I made a minor change
to (to allow better control of the direction of the wood grain) and a
displacement shader that caused the bumpiness, scratches, and chips in the
wood.  This latter item could have been better, but I was running out of
time.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The chalkboard is an image map created in the 0.99.8 developers release of
the Gimp.  This is a <I>very</I> cool tool for Linux and Unix platforms, very
similar to Photoshop (but apparently better, according to people who've
used both - I've never used Photoshop myself).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The image out the window is an image map on a simple plane angled away from
the window.  The window panes are dented using a displacement map.  We had
windows with bumps in them in High School and thats the effect I was going
for here.  Its pretty close and as an added benefit it prevents the image
outside the window from being too washed out.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The globe on the book shelf is one of those ones that is suspended by
magnets.  The globe has a displacement map on it as well, which is why,
if you look real close, the lighting on it is not smooth where it moves
into shadow.  The globe and its base were completely modeled in AC3D.  It
was quick and very easy to do.  All the items on the booksshelf by the
window are in a single model file, but exported as individual objects so
they could be shaded properly.  The same is true for the bookcase under the
clock.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It was fun.  This is certainly the best 3D image I've done to date.  Its
also the first one of something recognizable (as opposed to space ships and
planets no one has ever really seen). 

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<B>NOTE:</B>
One thing I forgot to mention in my original text file for my entry is that
I had to edit all the exported RIB files that I created with AC3D to remove
the bits of RIB that made each file an independently renderable file.  By
default AC3D generates a complete scene, one that can be passed to rendrib
(the BMRT renderer) directly to render a scene.  But what I needed was for
the files generated to be only partially complete scenes, without the
camera or lighting and so forth.  In this way I could use these files in
RIB ReadArchive statements, similar to #include files for POV.  Considering
the number of objects I exported with AC3D, that turned out to be quite a
bit of hand editing.  I sent email to Andy Colebourne, the author of AC3D,
and he's looking into making it possible to output partial RIBs for use as
ReadArchive include files.

<H2>1. A quick review</H2>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Before we get started on shaders, lets take a quick look back at RIB files.
RIB files are ASCII text files which describe a 3D scene to a RenderMan
compliant renderer such as BMRT.  A RIB file contains descriptions of
objects - their size, position in 3D space, the lights that illuminate them
and so forth.  Objects have surfaces that can be colored and textured,
allowing for reflectivity, opacity (or conversely, transparency),
bumpiness, and various other aspects.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An object is instanced inside AttributeBegin/AttributeEnd requests (or
procedures in the C binding).  This instancing causes the current graphics
state to be saved so that any changes made to the graphics state (via the
coloring and texturing of the object instance) inside the
AttributeBegin/AttributeEnd request will not affect future objects.  The
current graphics state can be modified, and objects colored and textured,
with special procedures called <I>shaders</I>.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<B>Note:</B>  
Keep in mind that this is not a full fledged tutorial and I won't be
covering every aspect of shaders use and design.  Detailed information can
be found in the texts listed in the bibliography at the end of this
article.


<P>

<A NAME="what"></A>
<H2>2. What is a shader?</H2>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the past, I've often used the terms <I>shading</I> and <I>texturing</I>
interchangeably.  Darwyn Peachy, in his 
<FONT COLOR="#335533">
<U><I>Building Procedural Textures</I></U>
</FONT>
chapter in the text <B>Texturing and Modeling:  A Procedural Approach</B>,
says that these two concepts are actually separate processes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Shading is the process of calculating the color of a pixel
	from user-specified surface properties and the shading model.
	Texturing is a method of varying the surface properties from
	point to point in order to give the appearance of surface
	detail that is not actually present in the geometry of the
	surface.
		[<A HREF="#ref1">1</A>]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
A shader is a procedure called by the renderer to apply colors and textures
to an object.  This can include the surface of objects like block or spheres, 
the internal space of a solid object, or even the space between objects
(the atmosphere).  Although based on Peachy's description would imply that
shaders only affect the coloring of surfaces (or atmosphere, etc), shaders
handle both shading and texturing in the RenderMan environment.  

<P>

<A NAME="compiling"></A>
<H2>3. Compiling shaders</H2>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
RIB files use filenames with a suffix of ".rib".  Similarly, shader files
use the suffix ".sl" for the shader source code.  Unlike RIB files, however,
shader files cannot be used by the renderer directly in their source
format.  They must be compiled by a shader compiler.  In the BMRT package
the shader compiler is called <I>slc</I>. 
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Compiling shaders is fairly straightforward - simply use the slc program
and provide the name of the shader source file.  For example, if you have a
shader source file named myshader.sl you would compile it with the
following command:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<CODE>
	slc myshader.sl
</CODE>
<BR>
You must provide the ".sl" suffix - the shader source file cannot be
specified using the base portion of the filename alone.
When the compiler has finished it will have created the compiled shader in
a file named myshader.so 
in the current directory.  A quick examination of
this file shows it to be an ASCII text file as well, but the format is
specific for the renderer in order for it to implement its graphics state
stack.
Note:  the filename extension of ".so" used by BMRT (which is different
than the one used by PRMan) does not signify a binary object file, like
shared library object files.  The file is an ASCII text file.  Larry says
he's considering changing to a different extension in the future to avoid
confusion with shared object files.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Note that in the RIB file (or similarly when using the C binding) 
the call to the shader procedure is done in the following manner:
<BR>
<PRE>
               AttributeBegin
                  Color [0.9 0.6 0.6]
                  Surface "myshader"
                  ReadArchive "object.rib"
               AttributeEnd
</PRE>
This example uses a <I>surface</I> shader (we'll talk about shader types in a
moment).  The name in double quotes is the name of the shader procedure
which is not necessarily the name of the shader source file.  
Since shaders are procedures they
have procedure names.  In the above example the procedure name is
<I>myshader</I>.  This happens to the be same as the base portion (without
the suffix) of the shader source filename.  The shader compiler doesn't
concern itself with the name of the source file, however, other than to
know which file to compile.  The output filename used for the .so file is
the name of the procedure.  So if you name your procedure differently than
the source file you'll get a differently named compiled .so file.  Although
this isn't necessarily bad, it does make it a little hard to keep track of
your shaders.  In any case, the name of the procedure is the name used in
the RIB (or C binding) when calling the shader.  In the above example,
"myshader" is the name of the procedure, not the name of the source file.


<P>

<A NAME="types"></A>
<H2>4. Types of shaders</H2>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
According to the <B>RenderMan Companion</B> [<A HREF="#ref2">2</A>]
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The RenderMan Interface specifies six types of shaders, distinguished
	by the inputs they use and the kinds of output they produce.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The text then goes on to describe the following shader types:
<OL>
	<LI>Light source shaders
	<LI>Surface shaders
	<LI>Volume shaders
	<LI>Displacement shaders
	<LI>Transformation shaders
	<LI>Imager shaders
</OL>
Most of these can only have one instance of the shader type in the graphics
state at any one time.  For example, there can only be one surface shader
in use for any object or objects at a time.  The exception to this are
light shaders, which may have many instances at any one time, some of which
may not be actually turned on for some objects.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#335533">
Light Source Shaders
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Light sources in the RenderMan Shading Language are provided a position and
direction and return the color of the light originating from that light and
striking the current surface point.  The RenderMan specification provides
for a set of default light shaders that are very useful and probably cover
the most common lighting configurations an average user might encounter.
These default shaders include ambient light (the same amount of light
thrown in all directions), distant lights (such as the Sun), point lights,
spot lights, and area lights.  All light sources have an intensity that
defines how bright the light shines.  Lights can be made to cast shadows or not
cast shadows.  The more lights that cast shadows you have in a scene the
longer it is likely to take to render the final image.  During scene design
and testing its often advantagous to keep shadows turned off for most lights.
When the scene is ready for its final rendering turn the shadows back on.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ambient light can be used to brighten up a generally dark image but the
effect is "fake" and can cause an image to be washed out, losing its
realism.  Ambient light should be kept small for any scene, say with an
intensity of no more than 0.03.  Distant lights provide a light that shines
in one direction with all rays being parallel.  The Sun is the most common
example of a distant light source.  Stars are also considered distant
lights.  If a scene is to be lit by sunlight it is often considered a good 
idea to have distant lights be the only lights to cast shadows.  Distant
lights do not have position, only direction.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Spot lights are the familiar lights which sit at a particular location in
space and shine in one generalized direction covering an area specified by 
a cone whose tip is the spot light.  A spot lights intensity falls off
exponentially with the angle from the centerline of the cone.  The angle is
specified in <I>radians</I>, not degress as with POV-Ray.  Specifying the
angle in degrees can have the effect of severly over lighting the area
covered by the spot light.  Point lights also fall off in intensity, but do
so with distance from the lights location.  A point light shines in all
directions at once so does not contain direction but does have position.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Area lights are series of point lights that take on the shape of an object
to which they are attached.  In this way a the harshness of the shadows
cast by a point light can be lessened by creating a larger surface of
emitted light.  I was not able to learn much about area lights so can't
really go into detail on how to use them here.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Most light source shaders use one of
two illumination functions:  illuminate() and solar().  Both provides ways
of integrating light sources on a surface over a finite cone.  illuminate()
allows for the specification of position for the light source, while
solar() is used for light sources that are considered very distant, like
the Sun or stars.  I consider the writing of light source shaders to be a
bit of an advanced topic since the use of the default light source shaders
should be sufficient for the novice user to which this article is aimed.
Readers should consult <B>The RenderMan Companion</B> and <B>The RenderMan
Specification</B> for details on the use of the default shaders.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#335533">
Surface Shaders
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Surface shaders are one of the two types of shaders novice users will make
use of most often (the other is displacement shaders).  Surface shaders are
used to determine the color of light reflected by a given surface point  
in a particular direction.  Surface shaders are used to create wood
grains or the colors of an eyeball.  They also define the opacity of a
surface, ie the amount of light that can pass through a point (the points
transparency).  A point that is totally opaque allows no light to pass
through it, while a point that is completely transparent reflects no light.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The majority of the examples which follow will cover surface shaders.  One
will be a displacement shader.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#335533">
Volume Shaders
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A volume shader affects light traveling to towards the camera as it passes
though and around objects in a scene.  Interior volume shaders determine
the effect on the light as it passes through an object.  Exterior volume
shaders affect the light in the "empty space" around an object.
Atmospheric shaders handle the space between objects.  Exterior 
and interior volume
shaders differ from atmospheric shaders in that the latter operate on all
rays originating from the camera (remember that ray tracing traces the
lights ray in reverse from nature - from camera to light source).  
Exterior and interior shaders work only on secondary rays, those rays
spawned by the <I>trace()</I> function in shaders.  
Atmospheric shaders are used
for things like fog and mist.  Volume shaders are a slightly more advanced
topic which I'll try to cover in a future article.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#335533">
Displacement Shaders
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The texture of an object can vary in many ways, from very smooth to very
bumpy, from smooth bumps to jagged edges.  With ordinary surface shaders a
texture can be simulated with the use of a <I>bump map</I>.  Bump maps
perturb the normal of a point on the surface of an object so that the point
appears to be raised, lowered, or otherwised moved from its real location.
A bump map describes the variations in a surfaces orientation.
Unfortunately, this is only a trick and the surface point is not really
moved.  For some surfaces this trick works well when viewed from the proper
angle.  But when seen edge on the surface variations disapper - the edge is
smooth.  A common example is an orange.  With a bump map applied the orange
appears to be pitted over its surface.  The edge of the sphere, however, is
smooth and the pitting effect is lost.  This is where displacement shaders
come in.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In <B>The RenderMan Interface Specification</B>[<A HREF="#ref3">3</A>] 
it says
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The displacement shader environment is very similar to a surface shader,
	except that it only has access to the geometric surface parameters.
	[A displacement shader] computes a new P [point] and/or a new N
	[normal for that point].
</BLOCKQUOTE>

A displacement shader operates across a surface, modifying the physical
location of each point.  These modifications are generally minor and of a
type that would be much more difficult (and computationally expensive) to
specify individually.  It might be difficult to appreciate this feature
until you've seen what it can do.  
Plate 9 in [<A HREF="#ref4">4</A>] shows an ordinary cylinder modified with
the <I>threads()</I> displacement shader to create the threads on the base
of a lightbulb.   <B>Figures 1-3</B> shows a similar (but less sophisticated) 
example.
Without the use of the displacement shader, each thread
would have to be made with one ore more individual objects.  Even if the
computational expense for the added objects were small, the effort required
to model these objects correctly would still be significant.  Displacement
shaders offer procedural control over the shape of an object.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An important point to remember when using displacement shaders with
BMRT is that, by default, displacements are not turned on.  Even if 
a displacement shader is called the points on the surface only have
their normals modified by the shader.  In order to do the "true 
displacement", two renderer attribute options must be set:
<PRE>
     Attribute "render" "truedisplacement" 1
     Attribute "displacementbound" "coordinatesystem" 
               "object" "sphere" 2
</PRE>
The first of these turns on the true displacement attribute so that
displacement shaders actually modify the position of a point on the
surface.  The second specifies how much the bounding box around the
object should grow in order to enclose the modified points.  
How this works is that the attribute tells the renderer how much the
bounding box is likely to grow <I>in object space</I>.  The renderer can't
no before hand how much a shader might modify a surface, so this statement
provides a maximum to help the renderer with bounding boxes around
displacement mapped objects.  Remember that bounding boxes are used help
speed up ray-object hit tests by the renderer.  Note that you can compute
the possible change caused by the displacement in some other space, such as
world or camera.  Use whatever is convenient.  The "sphere" tag lets the
renderer know that the bounding box will grow in all directions evenly.
Currently BMRT only supports growth in this manner, so no other values
should be used here.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#335533">
Transformation and Imager Shaders
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
BMRT doesn't support Transformation Shaders (neither does Pixar's PRMan
apparently).  Apparently transformation shaders are supposed to operate on
geometric coordinates to apply "non-linear geometric transformations".
According to [<A HREF="#ref5">5</A>]
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose of a transformation shader is to modify a coordinate system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is used to deform the geometry of a scene without respect to any
particular surface.  This differs from a displacement shader because the
displacement shader operates on a point-by-point basis for a given surface.
Transformation shaders modify the current transform, which means they
can affect all the objects in a scene.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Imager shaders appear to operate on the colors of output pixels which to me
means the shader allows for color correction or other manipulation after a
pixels color has been computed but prior to the final pixel output to file
or display.  This seems simple enough to understand, but why you'd use them
I'm not quite sure.  Larry says that BMRT supports Imager shaders but PRMan
does not.  However, he suggests the functionality provided is probably
better suited to post-processing tools, such as XV, ImageMagick or the Gimp.

<P>

<A NAME="syntax"></A>
<H2>5. Shader language syntax</H2>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So what does a shader file look like?  They are very similar in format to a
C procedure, with a few important differences.  The following is a very
simplistic surface shader:
<PRE>
        surface matte (
                 float Ka = 1;
                 float Kd = 1;
        )
        {
          point Nf;

          /*
           * Calculate the normal which is facing the
           * direction that points towards the camera.
           */
          Nf = faceforward (normalize(N),I);

          Oi = Os;
          Ci = Os * Cs * (Ka * ambient() + Kd * diffuse(Nf));
        }
</PRE>
This is the matte surface shader provided in the BMRT distribution.  The
matte surface shader happens to be one of a number of required shaders that
<B>The RenderMan Interface Specification</B> says a RenderMan compliant 
renderer must provide.  

<P>
<A NAME="names"></A>
<B><FONT COLOR="#335533">
Shader procedure names
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The first thing to notice is the procedure type and name.  In this case the
shader is a surface shader and its name is "matte".  When this code is
compiled by slc it will produce a shader called "matte" in a file called
"matte.so".  Procedure names can be any name that is not a reserved RIB
statement.  Procedure names may contain letters, numbers and underscores.
They may not contain spaces.

<P>
<A NAME="variables"></A>
<B><FONT COLOR="#335533">
Variables and scope
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There are a number of different kinds of variables that are used with
shaders:  Instance variables, global variables, and local variables.  
Instance variables are the variables used as parameters to the shader.
When calling a shader these variables are declared (if they have not
already been declared) and assigned a value to be used for that instance of
the shader.  For example, the matte shader provides two parameters that can
have appropriate values specified when the shader is instanced within the 
RIB file.  Lets say we have a sphere for which we will shade using the
matte shader.  We would specify the instance variables like so:
<PRE> 
        AttributeBegin
           Declare "Kd" "float"
           Declare "Ka" "float"
           Surface "matte" "Kd" 0.5 "Ka" 0.5
           Sphere 1 -.5 .5 360 
        AttributeEnd
</PRE> 
The values specified for Kd and Ks are the instance variables and the 
renderer will use these values for this instance of the shader.  Instance
variables are generally known only to the shader upon the initial call for
the current instance.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Local variables are defined within the shader itself and as such are only
known within the shader.  In the example matte shader, the variable Nf is a
point variable as has meaning and value only within the scope of the shader
itself.  Other shaders will not have access to the values Nf holds.
Local variables are used to hold temporary values required to compute the
values passed back to the renderer.  These return values are passed back as
global variables.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Global variables have a special place in the RenderMan environment.  The
only way a shader can pass values back to the renderer is through global
variables.  Some of the global variables that a shader can manipulate are
the surface color (Cs), surface opacity (Os), the normal vector for the
current point (N) and the incident ray opacity
(Oi).  Setting these values within the shader affects how the renderer
colors surface points for the object which is being shaded.  The complete
list of global variables that a particular shader type can read or modify
is listed in tables in the <B>RenderMan Interface Specification</B>
[<A HREF="#ref6">6</A>].
Global variables are global in the sense that they pass values between the
shader and the renderer for the current surface point, but they cannot be
used to pass values from one objects shader to another.

Data types and expressions
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Shaders have access to only 4 data types: one scalar type, two vector
types, and a string type.  A string can be defined and used by a shader, but
it cannot be modified.  So an instance variable that passes in a string
value cannot be modified by the shader, nor can a local string variable be
modified once it has been defined.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The scaler type used by shaders is called a <I>float</I> type.  Shaders must use
float variables even for integer calculations.  The </I>point</I> type is a
a 3 element array of float values which describe a point in some space.
By default the point is in <I>world space</I> in BMRT (PRMan uses camera
space by default), but it is possible to
convert the point to object, world, texture or some other space within the
shader.  On point can be transformed to a different space using the
<I>transform</I> statement.  For example:
<PRE>
       float y = ycomp(transform("object",P));
</PRE>
will convert the current point to object space and return the Y component
of the new point into the float variable y.  The other vector type is also
a 3 element array of float values that specify a color.  A <I>color</I>
type variable can be defined as follows:
<PRE>
       color Cp = color (0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
</PRE>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Expressions in the shading language follow the same rules of precedence
that are used in the C language.  The only two expressions that are new to
shaders are the Dot Product and the Cross Product.  The Dot Product is 
used to measure the angle between two vectors and is denoted by a period
(.).  Dot Products work on point variables.
The Cross Product is often used to find the normal vector
at a point given two nonparallel vectors tangent to the surface at a given
point.  The Cross Product only works on points, is denoted by a caret (^)
and returns a point value.

Functions
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A shader need not be a completely self contained entity.  It can call
external routines, known as functions.  The RenderMan Interface
Specificatoin predefines a large number of functions that
are available to shader authors using BMRT.  The following list is just
a sample of these predefined functions:
<UL>
	<LI>Math functions such as sin(), cos(), pow(), exp(), sqrt() and log().
	<LI>Math functions such as min(), max() and clamp().
	<LI>Derivative functions Du(), Dv(), and Deriv() which have versions
		which work on float, color, and point values.
	<LI>A noise() function for random value.
	<LI>Geometric functions like area(), length() and distance().
	<LI>Color functions like mix() which mixes two of its arguments based on 
		a third argument.
	<LI>Shading and Lighting functions such as specular() and phong()
	<LI>Texture map functions for using texture maps within shaders
</UL>
This is not a comprehensive list, but it provides a sample of the
functions available to the shader author.  Many functions operate on more
than one data type (such as points or colors).  Each can be used to
calculate a new color, point, or float value which can then be applied to
the current surface point.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Shaders can use their own set of functions defined locally.  In fact, its
often helpful to put functions into a function library that can be included
in a shader using the #include directive.  For example, the 
<A HREF="http://www.cgrg.ohio-state.edu/~smay/RManNotes/index.html">
RManNotes Web site</A>
provides a function library called "rmannotes.sl" which contains a
<I>pulse()</I> function that can be used to create lines on a surface.  If
we were to use this function in the matte shader example, it might look
something like this:
<PRE>
        #include "rmannotes.sl"

        surface matte (
                 float Ka = 1;
                 float Kd = 1;
        )
        {
          point Nf;
          float fuzz = 0.05
          color Ol;

          /*
           * Calculate the normal which is facing the
           * direction that points towards the camera.
           */
          Nf = faceforward (normalize(N),I);

          Ol = pulse(0.35, 0.65, fuzz, s);
          Oi = Os*Ol;
          Ci = Os * Cs * (Ka * ambient() + Kd * diffuse(Nf));
        }
</PRE>
The actual function is defined in the rmmannotes.sl file as
<PRE>
  #define pulse(a,b,fuzz,x) (smoothstep((a)-(fuzz),(a),(x)) - \
                             smoothstep((b)-(fuzz),(b),(x)))
</PRE>
A shader could just as easily contain the #defined value directly without
including another file, but if the function is useful shader authors may
wish to keep them in a separate library similar to rmmannotes.sl.  In this
example, the variable s is the left-to-right component of the current
texture coordinate.  "s" is a component of the <I>texture space</I>, which
we'll cover in the section on coordinate systems.  "s" is a global variable
which is why it is not defined within the sample code.

<P>
Note:  This particular example might not be very useful. It is just meant to 
show how to include functions from a function library.

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Functions are only callable by the shader, not directly by the renderer.
This means a function cannot be used directly in a RIB file or referenced
using the C binding to the RenderMan Interface.  Functions cannot be
recursive - they cannot call themselves.  Also, all variables passed to
functions are passed by reference, not by value.  It is important to
remember this last item so that your function doesn't inadvertantly make 
changes to variables you were not expecting.

<A NAME="statements"></A>
<B><FONT COLOR="#335533">
Statements

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The shading language provides the following statements for flow control:

	<LI><B>if-then-else</B>
	<LI><B>while (</B>boolean expression<B>)</B>  <I>statement</I>
	<LI><B>for (</B>expr; boolean expr; expr<B>)</B> <I>statement</I>

	<LI><B>return </B> expression

<A NAME="coordinates"></A>
<B><FONT COLOR="#335533">
Coordinate Systems
</FONT></B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There are number of coordinate systems used by RenderMan.  Some of these I
find easy to understand by themselves, others are more difficult -
especially when used within shaders.  In a shader, the surface of an object
is mapped to a 2 dimensional rectangular grid.  This grid runs from
coordinates (0,0) in the upper left corner to (1,1) in the lower right
corner.  The grid is overlayed on the surface, so on a rectangular patch
the mapping is obvious.  On a sphere the upper corners of the grid map to
the same point on the top of the sphere.  This grid is known as
<I>parameter space</I> and any point in this space is referred to by the
global variables <I>u</I> and <I>v</I>.  For example, a point on the
surface which is in the exact center of the grid  would have (u,v)
coordinates (.5, .5).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Similar to parameter space is <I>texture space</I>.  Texture space is a
mapping of a texture map that also runs from 0 to 1, but the variables used
for texture space are <I>s</I> and <I>t</I>.  By default, texture space is
equivalent to parameter space unless either vertex variables (variables 
applied to vertices of primitive objects like patches or polygons) or the 
TextureCoordinates statement have modified the texture space of the primitive 
being shaded.  Using the default then, a texture map image would have its upper
left corner mapped to the upper left corner of the parameter space grid
overlying the objects surface, and the lower right corner of the image
would be mapped to the lower right corner of the grid.  The image would
therefore cover the entire object.  Since the texture space does not have
to be equivalent to parameter space it would be possible to map an image to
only a portion of an object.  Unfortunately, I didn't get far enough this
month to provide an example of how to do this.  Maybe next month.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There are other spaces as well:  world space, object space, and shader space.
How each of these affects the shading and texturing characteristics is not
completely clear to me yet.  Shader space is the default space in which
shaders operate, but points in shader space can be transformed to world or
object space before being operated on.  I don't know exactly what this
means or why you'd want to do it just yet

<H2>6. Format of a shader file</H2>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Shader files are fairly free form, but there are
methodologies that can be used to make writing shaders easier and the code
more understandable.  In his 
RManNotes [<A HREF="#ref7">7</A>], Stephen F. May writes
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	One of the most fundamental problem solving techniques is "divide and
	conquer." That is, break down a complex problem into simpler parts; 
	solve the simpler parts; then combine those parts to
	solve the original complex problem. 
	<P>
	In shaders, [we] break down complicated surface patterns and textures into
	layers. Each layer should be fairly easy to write (if not, then we can 
	break the layer into sub-layers). Then, [we] combine the layers by 
	compositing. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The basic structure of a shader is similar to a procedure in C - the shader
is declared to be a particular type (surface, displacement, and so forth)
and a set of typed parameters are given.  Unlike C, however, shader
parameters are required to have default values provided.  In this way a
shader may be instanced without the use of any instance variables.  If any
of the parameters are specified with instance variables then the value in
the instance variable overrides the parameters default value.  An
minimalist shader might look like the following:
<PRE>
        surface null ()
        {
        }
</PRE>
In fact, this is exactly the definition of the null shader.  Don't ask me
why such a shader exists.  I'm sure the authors of the specification had a
reason.  I just don't know what it is.  Adding a few parameters, we start
to see the matte shader forming:
<PRE>
        surface matte (
                 float Ka = 1;
                 float Kd = 1;
        )
        {
        }
</PRE>
The parameters Ka and Kd have their default values provided.  Note that Ka
is commonly used in the shaders in Guido Quaroni's archive of shaders to
represent a scaling factor for ambient light.  Similarly, Kd is used to
scale diffuse light.  These are not global variables, but they are well
known variables, much like "i", "j", and "k" are often used as counters in
C source code (a throwback to the heady days of Fortran programming).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
After the declaration of the shader and its parameters comes the set of
local variables and the shader code that does the "real work".  Again, we 
look at the matte shader:
<PRE>
        #include "rmannotes.sl"

        surface matte (
                 float Ka = 1;
                 float Kd = 1;
        )
        {
          point Nf;
          float fuzz = 0.05
          color Ol;

          /*
           * Calculate the normal which is facing the
           * direction that points towards the camera.
           */
          Nf = faceforward (normalize(N),I);

          Ol = pulse(0.35, 0.65, fuzz, s);
          Oi = Os*Ol;
          Ci = Os * Cs * (Ka * ambient() + Kd * diffuse(Nf));
        }
</PRE>
Nothing special here.  It looks very much like your average C procedure.
Now we get into methodologies.  May [<A HREF="#ref8">8</A>] shows us how a
layered shader's psuedo-code might look:
<PRE>
        surface banana(...)
        {
          /* background (layer 0) */
          surface_color = yellow-green variations;

          /* layer 1 */
          layer = fibers;
          surface_color = composite layer on surface_color;

          /* layer 2 */
          layer = bruises;
          surface_color = composite layer on surface_color;

          /* layer 3 */
          layer = bites;
          surface_color = composite layer on surface_color;

          /* illumination */
          surface_color = illumination based on surface_color 
                          and illum params;

          /* output */
          Ci = surface_color;
        }
</PRE>
What is happening here is that the lowest level applies yellow-and green
colors to the surface, after which a second layer has fiber colors
composited (blended or overlayed) in.  This continues for each of 4 defined
layers (0 through 3) plus an illumination calculation to determine the
relative brightness of the current point.  Finally, the newly computed
surface color is ouput via a global variable.
Using this sort of methodology makes writing a shader much easier as well
as allowing other shader authors to debug and/or extend the shader in the
future.  A shader file is therefore sort of bottom-up design, where the
bottom layers of the surface are calculated first and the topmost layers
are computed last.

<P>

<A NAME="texture-maps"></A>
<H2>7. A word about texture maps</H2>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As discussed earlier, texture maps are images mapped from 0 to 1 from left
to right and top to bottom upon a surface.  Every sample in the image is
interpolated between 0 and 1.  The mapping does not have to apply to the
entire surface of an object, however, and when used in conjunction with the
parameter space of the surface (the u,v coordinates) it should be possible
to map an image to a section of a surface.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to determine exactly how to use this knowledge
for the image I submitted to the IRTC this month.  Had I figured it out
in time, I could have provided text labels on the bindings of the books in
the bookcases for that scene.  Hopefully, I'll figure this out in time for
the next article on BMRT and can provide an example on how to apply texture
maps to portions of surfaces.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This example is taken verbatim from RManNotes by Stephen F. May.
The shader creates a two color cross pattern.  In this example the pattern
is applied to a simple plane (a bilinear patch).  Take a look at the 
<A HREF="./source/crosstile.sl">source code</A>.

		The first thing you notice is that this shader defines two local
		color variables: surface_color and layer_color.  
		The layer_color variable is used to compute the current layers color.
		The surface_color variable is used to composite the various layers 
		of the shader.  Two other variables, surface_opacity and
		layer_opacity, work similarly for the opacity of the current layer.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		The first layer is a verticle stripe.  The shader defines the color
		for this layer and then determines the opacity for the current point
		by using a function called <I>pulse()</I>.  This is a function
		provided by May in his "rmannotes.sl" function library.  The pulse()
		function allows the edges of the stripes in this shader to flow
		smoothly from one color to another (take a look at the edges of
		the stripes in the
		sample image).  pulse() uses the fuzz variable to determine how
		fuzzy the edges will be.
		Finaly, for each layer the layers color and opacity
		are blended together to get the new surface color.  The <I>blend()</I>
		function is also part of rmannotes.sl and is an extension of the
		RenderMan Interface's mix() function, which mixes color and opacity 
		values.

	This example is taken from the RenderMan Companion.  It shows how a shader
	can be used to cut out portions of a solid surface.  We use the first
	example as a backdrop for a sphere that is shaded with the screen() shader
	from the RenderMan Companion text (the name of the shader as used here is
	slightly different because it is taken from the collection of shaders from 
	Guido Quaroni, who changed the names of some shaders to reflect their
	origins).  First lets look at the sceen using the "plastic" shader
	(which comes as a default shader in the BRMT distribution).  Figure 5 shows
	how this scene renders.  The sphere is solid in this example.  The
	RIB code for this contains the following lines:
<PRE>
        AttributeBegin
           Color [ 1.0 0.5 0.5 ]
           Surface "plastic"
           Sphere 1 -1 1 360 
        AttributeEnd
</PRE>
	In Figure 6 the sphere has been changed to a wireframe surface.  The
	only difference between this scene and Figure 5 is the surface shader used.
	For Figure 6 the rib code looks like this:
<PRE>
        AttributeBegin
           Color [ 1.0 0.5 0.5 ]
           Surface "RCScreen"
           Sphere 1 -1 1 360 
        AttributeEnd

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The local variable V is defined to be the normalized vector for the
incident light rays direction.  The incident light ray direction is the
direction from which the camera views the current surface coordinate.
This value is used later to compute the specular highlight to be used on
the portion of the surface which will not be cut out of the sphere.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The next thing the shader does is to compute the modulo of the s component
of the texture space times the frequency of the grid lines of the
wireframe.  This value is always less than 1 (the modulo of s*frequency is
the remainder left for n*1 < s*frequency for some value n).  If this value
is also less then the density then the current coordinate on the surface is
part of the visible wireframe that traverses the surface horizontally.
Likewise, the same modulo is computed for t*frequency and if this value is
also less than the density then the current coordinate point is on one of
the visible verticle grid lines of the wireframe.  Any point for which the
module of either of these is greater than the density is rendered
completely transparent.  The last line computes the grid lines based on the
current surface color and a slightly metallic lighting model. 
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The default value for the density is .25, which means that approximately
1/4 of the surface will be visible wireframe.  Changing the value with an
instance variable to .1 would cause the the wireframe grid lines to become 
thinner.  Figure 7 shows an example of this.  Changing the frequency to a
smaller number would cause fewer grid lines to be rendered.

While working on my entry for the March/April 1997 round of the IRTC I
wrote my first shader - a shader to simulate 3 holed notebook paper.  This
simplistic shader offers some of the characteristics of the previous
examples in producing regularly spaced horizontal and verticle lines plus
the added feature of fully transparent circular regions that are positioned
by instance variables.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We start by defining the parameters needed by the shader.  There are quite
a few more parameters than the other shaders.  The reason for this is that
this shader works on features which are not quite so symmetrical.  You can
also probably chalk it up to my inexperience.

The colors of the horizontal and vertical lines come first.  There are, by
default, 34 lines on the paper with the first 4 "skipped" to give the small
header space at the top of the paper.  The vertical frequency is used to
divide the paper in n equal vertical blocks across the page.  This is used
to determine the location of the single verticle stripe.  We'll look at
this again in a moment.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The paper height and width are used to map the parameter space into the
correct dimensions for ordinary notebook paper.  The density parameter is
the width of each of the visible lines (horizontal and vertical) on the
paper.  The hole offset defines the distance from the left edge of the
paper to the center point of the 3 holes to be punched out.  The holeradius is
the radius of the holes and the hole1-hole3 parameters give the horizontal
line over which the center of that hole will live.  For example, for hole1
the center of the hole is 2.6 horizontal stripes down.  Actually, the
horizontal stripes are created at the top of equally sized horizontal
blocks, and the hole1-hole3 values are number of horizontal blocks to
traverse down the paper for the holes center.
Now lets look at how the lines are created.

<table>
	<td valign=top width=60%>
<PRE>
   surface_color = Cs;
</PRE>
	This line simply initializes a local variable to the current color of
	the surface.  We'll use this value in computing a new surface color
	based on whether the point is on a horizontal or vertical line.
<PRE>
/*
 * Layer 1 - horizontal stripes.  
 * There is one stripe for every
 * horizontal block.  The stripe is 
 * "density" thick and starts at the top of
 * each block, except for the first "skip" 
 * blocks.
 */
tt = t*paper_height;
for ( horiz=skip; horiz&lthfreq; horiz=horiz+1 )
{
   min = horiz*hblock;
   max = min+density;
   val = smoothstep(min, max, tt);
   if ( val != 0 && val != 1 )
      surface_color = mix(hcolor, Cs, val);
}
</PRE>
This loop runs through all the horizontal blocks on the paper
(defined by the hfreq parameter) and determines if the point
lies between the top of the block and the top of the block plus
the width of a horizontal line (specified with the density parameter).

The smoothstep() function is part of the standard RenderMan functions
and returns a value that is between 0 and 1, inclusive, that shows where
"tt" sits between the min and max values.  If this value is not at
either end then the current surface point lies in the bounds of a
horizontal line.  The point is given the "hcolor" value mixed with the
current surface color We mix the colors in order to allow
the edges of the lines to flow smoothly between the horizontal lines
color and the color of the paper.  In other words, this allows for
antialiasing the horizontal lines.  The problem with this is - it doesn't
work.  It only aliases one side of the line, I think.  In any case, you can
see from Figure 8 that the result does not quite give a smooth, 
solid set of lines.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An alternative approach would be to change the mix() function call (which
is part of the RenderMan shading lanague standard functions) to a more
simple mixture of the line color with the value returned by smoothstep().
This code would look like this: 
<PRE>
   min = horiz*hblock;
   max = min+density;
   val = smoothstep(min, max, tt);
   if ( val != 0 && val != 1 )
      surface_color = val*hcolor;
</PRE>
Alternatively, the line color could be used on its own, without combining
it with the value returned from the smooth step.  This gives a very jagged
line, but the line is much darker even when used with smaller line
densities.  The result from using the line color alone (with a smaller line
density) can be seen in Figure 9.

<PRE>
   /* Layer 2 - vertical stripe */
   ss = s*paper_width;
   min = vblock;
   max = min+density;
   val = smoothstep(min, max, ss);
   if ( val != 0 && val != 1 )
      surface_color = mix(vcolor, Cs, val);
</PRE>
This next bit of code does exactly the same as the previous code
except it operates on the vertical line.  Since there is only one
verticle line there is no need to check every vertical block, only
the one which will contain the visible stripe (which is specified
with the vblock parameter).
		
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Finally we look at the hole punches. The center of the holes are computed
relative to the left edge of the paper:
<PRE>
   shole = holeoffset*paper_width;
   ss  = s*paper_height;
   tt  = t*paper_height;
   pos = (ss,tt,0);
</PRE>
Note that we use the papers height for converting the ss,tt variables into
the scale of the paper width and height.  Why?  Because if we used the
width for ss we would end up with eliptical holes.  There is probably a
better way to deal with this problem (of making the holes circular) but
this method worked for me.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
For each hole, the current s,t coordinates distance from the hole
centers is computed.  If the distance is less than the holes radius then
the opacity for the incident ray is set to completely transparent.

<PRE>
   /* First Hole */
   thole = hole1*hblock;
   hpos  = (shole, thole, 0);
   Oi = filterstep (holeradius*paper_width, 
                     distance(pos,hpos));

   /* Second Hole */
   thole = hole2*hblock;
   hpos = (shole, thole, 0);
   Oi *= filterstep (holeradius*paper_width, 
                      distance(pos,hpos));

   /* Third Hole */
   thole = hole3*hblock;
   hpos = (shole, thole, 0);
   Oi *= filterstep (holeradius*paper_width, 
                      distance(pos,hpos));
</PRE>
Filterstep is, again, a standard function in the RenderMan specification.
However, this function was not documented by either the RenderMan Interface
Specification or the RenderMan Companion.  According to Larry Gritz
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The filterstep() function is identical to step, except that it is
analytically antialiased.  Similar to the texture() function,
filterstep actually takes the derivative of its second argument, and
"fades in" at a rate dependent on how fast that variable is changing.
In technical terms, it returns the convolution of the step function
with a filter whose width is about the size of a pixel.  So, no
jaggies. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, using filterstep() helped to antialias the edges of the holes
(although its not that obvious from such a small image given in Figures 8
and 9).  I didn't try it, but I bet filterstep() could probably be used to
fix the problems with the horizontal and vertical lines.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This simple texture map example is used in my <I>Post Detention</I> image
which I entered in the March/April 1997 IRTC.  The actual shader is taken
from the archive collection by Guido Quaroni, and the shader  originally
comes from Larry Knott (who I presume works at Pixar).  I didn't add an
image of this since all you would see would be the original image mapped on a
flat plane, which really doesn't show anything useful.  If you want to take
a look at the chalkboard in a complete scene, take a look at the 
<A HREF="more-musings.html#1">companion article</A>
in this months Graphics Muse column.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Like the other shader examples, this one is fairly straightforward.  An
image filename is passed in the <I>texturename</I> parameter.  Note that
image files must be TIFF files for use with BMRT.  The texture coordinates
are used to grab a value from the image file which is then combined with
the ambient and diffuse lighting for the incident ray.  If a specular
highlight has been specified (which it is by default in the Ks parameter)
then a specular highlight is added to the incident ray.  Finally, the
output value, Ci, is combined with the surfaces opacity for the final color
to be used by the current surface point.
<P>

<A NAME="examples-5"></A>
<A HREF="./source/RCThreads.sl">
<FONT size=3><B>Displacement map example</B></FONT>
</A>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We've already seen an example of displacement maps using the threads()
shader.  Lets take a quick look at the shader code:
<PRE>
   magnitude = (sin( PI*2*(t*frequency + 
                     s + phase))+offset) * Km;
</PRE>
Here, the displacement of the surface point is determined by using a
phased sinusoidal.  The t variable determines the position lengthwise
across the surface and s is used to cause the spiraling effect.  The next
bit of code
<PRE>
   if( t > (1-dampzone)) 
      magnitude *= (1.0-t) / dampzone;
   else if( t < dampzone )
      magnitude *= t / dampzone;
</PRE>
causes the ends of the surface, in our case a cylinder, to revert to the 
original shape.  For our example that means this forces the shader to leave
the ends circular.  This helps to keep the object that has been threaded in
a shape that is easily joined to other objects.  In the RenderMan
Companion, the threaded cylinder is joined to a glass bulb to form a
light bulb.  Finally, the last two lines
<PRE>
   P += normalize(N) * magnitude;
   N = calculatenormal(P);
</PRE>
cause the point to be moved and the normal for the new point to be
calculated.  In this way the point visually appears to have moved, which
indeed it has.

<P>
Next month I planned on doing the 3rd part of this 3 part BMRT series.  I
think taking 2 months between articles worked well for me this time since
it allowed me a little more time to dig deeper.  Plan on the final article
on BMRT in this series in the July issue of the Graphics Muse.  Till then,
happy rendering.

<H2>Kandinski</H2>
<H4>By Jeff Hohensee,
<a href="mailto:"oot@casper.com">ott@casper.com</a></H4>

</center>
<P> <HR> 

<p>Kandinski is my new pre-pre-pre-beta program which generates a picture
file from a MIDI file. It does so based on my cycluphonic method of 
correlating colors to musical pitches. The few careful observers who have 
seen previous implementations of cycluphonics agree that it gives visual
events which seem to sympathize with the generating music, in terms of
implied feeling, better than previous "color organ" methods.
Kandinski was written with pfe under Linux on a 486. It should be easy to
port to another ANSI Forth system, as I am rusty at Forth, and the task at
hand didn't call for any trickery, and I avoided the Linux-specific stuff
in pfe, mostly because I couldn't find much documentation on it.
The code presented here creates a .ppm image file on a selectable track by
track basis. The piano envelope option is not implemented yet, just organ. 
.ppm files can be converted to just about any image format with the unix
pbmplus tools, and are viewable in Linux with zgv. 
The crucial cycluphonic element in Kandinski is the "cycle" construct,
a lookup table which Kandinski uses to map a 12 hue color wheel to the
Cycle of Fifths. That's the crux of cycluphonics. If you use this code, or
cycluphonics, give credit where due.

<h3>How Kandinski operates ( I hope )</h3>
Copy a MIDI file with some tonal music to filename in.mid .
Run your ANSI Forth in the same directory. Include the Kandinski code into
your dictionary. Type main  at the ok prompt. Kandinski will check in.mid
for a MIDI header. If in.mid is a midi file, Kandinski will traverse
tracks until it finds a noteon message. It will then tell you a bit about
the track and ask you if you want to make a picture of it. Hit y and it
will ask you if you want to use a piano or an organ type volume envelope.
The piano option is curently just a stub. Kandinski will then ask you to
hit a key to seed the filename randomizer. Kandinski will then create a
picture file with a filename of the form kanrrrrr.ppm, where r is a random
letter. The track portion of the program repeats if there are more tracks
with notes. The pictures created by Kandinski are 640 by 80 pixels, 24
bits color depth. I will soon be putting some Kandinski output up at

<H2>1997 Linux Expo</H2>
<H4>By Jon "maddog" Hall
<a href="mailto:"maddog@zk3.dec.com">maddog@zk3.dec.com</a></H4>
</center>

<HR> <P> 
<p>"Well, should we get one pitcher or two?" That was the question
that began the first unofficial event of the Linux Expo Thursday
night. A group of people, including Red Hat employees, some of the
speakers and a tired maddog were at the Carolina Brewery in
Chapel Hill, North Carolina. It was late, and I was the
last person to arrive."Two pitchers," I cried,"Now what
will you be drinking?"

<p>The next day, Friday April 4th started early, as I had to set up
the Linux International booth, as well as absorb all that was
happening. The event was held in the North Carolina
Biotechnology Center at Research Triangle Park. As I
approached the Biotech Center, I was met with a friendly
parking coordinator that reinforced the information that
"parking was scarce", and that most people had to park at
outlying lots. Fortunately Red Hat had arranged for shuttle
busses from those lots and from several of the hotels. Since our
car had an exhibitor's pass, we were able to park close to the
Biotech Center and unload our banners, handouts and stuffed
penguins.

<p>There was a large tent to the left outside of the building
containing the "Linux Expo Super Store" stocked with
Linux books, Linux bumper stickers, T-shirts (including
an excellently designed Expo shirt that said "Expose yourself to
Linux" with a front and rear view of a penguin holding open an
overcoat) and other interesting souvenir items. Further
to the left was an outdoor viewing area for the conference talks
that (due to the excellent weather) was a favorite spot for
people to view the technical talks for free, especially while
playing Frisbee. A raffle was held in the registration area, 
and prizes were given away on an hourly basis.
Having registered, attendees were given a copy of the talks as
well as an event schedule.


<p>The event was held on two floors with the exhibits spread out on both. There
was another conference viewing area inside the building with TV
monitors, as well as the conference auditorium itself. There was
an Install Fest area (sponsored by the Washington D.C. Linux
User's Group, Linux Hardware Solutions and Red Hat Software),
where people brought their systems, received help with installing
Red Hat's latest release, and Olaf Kirch's kernel-based NFS
server was "stress tested" at the same time. Finally, there was a food
court area, where people could buy sandwiches, chips, soda and
other "software development food".

<p>There were fifteen vendors at the Expo, each with "table-top"
booths to display their wares. I prefer the "pipe-and-drape"
approach to trade shows rather than expensive booths, since I
would rather the vendors put more money into development of the
product and less into elaborate displays or floor shows with
unicycle riders who juggle things. While not all Linux vendors
were at Linux Expo, a wide spectrum of companies, including Linux
International, Cyclades, Numerical Algorithms Group, Linux
Hardware Solutions, Enhanced Software Technologies, Caldera,
Applix, Xess, WorkGroup Solutions, Stay Online, VA Research, Apex
Systems Integration, PromoX Systems and (of course) Red Hat
Software were present. One item being demonstrated at the Linux
Hardware Solutions booth was a free piece of software called [cw]em86[ecw]
that allowed an Intel/Linux binary to run without change on an
Alpha/Linux system. Being shown for the first time, it allowed
Applixware, Netscape and various other applications to execute as
if they had been ported to the system.

<p>Penguins abounded in various T-shirts, giveaways and objects
d'art. In fact, there were so many people there (I estimated 900
over the two-day event) with penguin "stuff", that I thought
I'd
had enough of penguins; but afterwards while wandering around Chapel Hill, Alan Cox found some
candy in the shape of penguins, so penguin "lust" started all
over again.

<p>The technical conference started off with a presentation by
Gilbert Coville of Apple Computer with a talk about the MkLinux
kernel. For people who were afraid that this would turn into a
"Red Hat Only" event, it was interesting that Gilbert's talk
opened the Expo and that a talk about the Debian Linux
Distribution (given by Bruce Perens) followed shortly after.
Bruce also discussed the graphics used in the making of Toy Story in
a separate presentation.

<p>Various presentations about hardware-specific ports were given.
Dave Miller talked about the "Next Generation SPARCLinux" as well
as the Free Software Development Model, and David Mosberger-Tang
talked about the Alpha Port, as well as methods, applicable to both Intel
and Alpha, for
speeding up your programs by paying attention to memory and
cache accesses.

<p>Other talks were more general across the Linux OS, such as Jeff
Uphoff's "Network File Locking", Alan Cox's "Tour of the Linux
Networking Stack", Peter Braam's "Coda Filesystem", Alexander
Yuriev's talk on the IPv4 family of protocols and infrastructure
and his talk on security, Michael Callahan's "Linux and Legacy
LANs", Eric Youngdale's "Beyond ELF", Olaf Kirch's "Linux Network
File System", Theodore Ts's "Ext2 File System: Design,
Implementation and the Future", Miguel de Icaza's talk on the new
RAID code and Daniel Quinlan's talk on the File System Hierarchy
Standard.

<p>To round out the list of talks and events was Dr. Greg
Wettstein's talk on "Working and Playing with others: Linux Grows
Up" and the Linux Bowl.

<p>The Linux Bowl was the final event. Two teams
of six developers were pitted against each other to answer
thirty questions about Linux and the Linux community. Questions
ranged from "What liquid should one drink between rounds of a
Finnish sauna?" (correct answer: beer) to "What version library
fixed a particular security hole?" to which Alan Cox gave a
(seemingly) ten minute answer. While some of the questions were
very obscure (even the moderator was unsure of the answer), most
of the time either the right answer (or a good facsimile) was
given.

<p>The show sponsors (after tallying up the attendence) reported that
958 people showed up, which could be the largest Linux-specific event
ever, of which 40% were from within North Carolina.  Attendees came from
over 25 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and 10 countries, including Australia,
Korea and European countries.


<p>Finally, I would like to thank the members of the Atlanta Linux
Enthusiasts <a href="http://www.ale.org/">http://www.ale.org/</a> group who helped to staff the Linux
International booth. They were great and helped give me the freedom
to get out from behind the booth every once in a while, because
most importantly, Linux Expo was a chance to talk with the
vendors, the developers and other old and new friends on a
one-to-one, quality basis. Perhaps some things could be improved
for next year: A larger auditorium for the talks, more and
closer parking  and less expensive food in the food court. But
certainly the southern hospitality and warmth of Red Hat Software
came through. I want to thank the sponsors for arranging a great event,
and I hope that next year's will be even larger and better.

<h1>A Fresh Beginning: The Enlightenment Window Manager</h1>
<H4>By Larry Ayers,
<a href="mailto:layers@vax2.rainis.net">layers@vax2.rainis.net</a></H4>
</center>

<P> <HR> <P>
<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>Most of the window-managers available for Linux these days can trace their
ancestry back to the original twm program, which may have been the first
widely used manager on unix systems.  There is a good reason for this, as twm
pioneered many of the features taken for granted by users, such as movable,
resizable windows and a root-window applications menu.  It's good, time-tested 
code; why reinvent the wheel?

<p>Two programmers have recently done just that, from two perspectives as far
removed from each other as their respective geographical locations.  Chris
Cannam, a British programmer, has taken the minimalist approach with his wm2
manager (which I wrote about in LG #14) and the new wm2 variant wmx, which I
discuss elsewhere in this issue.

<p>At the other extreme is the work of a young Australian programmer who likes 
to be known as the Rasterman.  Imagine asking the programmers responsible for
the games Quake or Duke Nukem 3D to write a window-manager; the result might
bear some resemblance to the fanciful program known as Enlightenment.

<p>I first encountered Enlightenment (what a name! it seems to carry the
implication that we users of fvwm et al are still crawling blindly through the
primordial ooze...) earlier this year, when a binary was available on the web.
I tried it briefly, but at the time I had a 486 machine; it ran slowly for me
and seemed to consume great gobs of memory.  Recently the Rasterman
 (his real name is Carsten Haitzler) has rewritten the application from scratch,
tightening it up and introducing a new shared lib which handles image loading
and rescaling.  The memory consumption has been greatly reduced since the
initial release.  At this point (beta release 4) there are no virtual desktops
or root-window menus, but the project looks promising and what there is of it
runs well for me. 

<center><h3>Features and Appearance</h3></center>

<p>Enlightenment uses the <b>ppm</b> image format for both window details and
icons.  An elaborate configuration file (called <i>windowstyles</i>) specifies
which image goes where.  Each segment of the window border and detailing is a
separate <b>ppm</b> file.  I haven't made any attempt to modify the default
configuration.  It looks like it would take many hours to write a new one. Carsten
plans on eventually offering configurations which would emulate any of the
other window-managers.

<p>I get the impression from the Enlightenment web-page that the <b>ppm</b>
format is more efficient than others, especially on 16-32 bit displays.  I
don't know how valid this is, but the window-manager <i>does</i> seem to do
quite a bit of image handling without consuming great amounts of memory. 

<p>This window-manager automatically will load any sort of image format as a
root background image.  At startup the appropriate netpbm utility is summoned
to transform the image to the <b>ppm</b> format. Naturally, you need
to have the netpbm graphics utility package installed for this to work.

<p>Here is a screenshot of a window under Enlightenment:<br>
<p>
<img alt="Enlightenment Window" src="../gx/ayers/enl.gif"><br>

<p> XV (with which I made the screenshot) couldn't figure out where the actual
window border was; can you blame it?  I set the root-window background to be
the same color as this HTML-file background as a quick work-around.

<center><h3>Availability</h3></center>

<p>The Enlightenment web-site is at <a href=
"http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2154962/enlightenment/index.html">
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2154962/enlightenment/index.html</a>.
The source for the latest version can be downloaded from the site; the latest
news about the application will also be there.

<center><h3>Closing Thoughts</h3></center>

<p>It will be interesting to see what eventually happens with Enlightenment,
though personally I'm satisfied with the window-managers I currently use.  I
just like to see diversity in software for Linux.  Fancy new window-borders
might seem to be a trivial matter but it is user-interface features such as
these which can attract new users, especially younger ones.  I showed
Enlightenment to my sixteen-year-old son (an avid computer- game player) and
he was impressed.  His comment was "It looks like a game interface!".

<p>Another factor is the simple human desire for novelty.  Sometimes the same
old interface becomes boring -- you realize you aren't really even seeing it
anymore.  A change in background and window-style can be refreshing.  People
routinely change room interiors for these same reasons and, come to think of
it, I look at my computer screen quite a bit more than I do the walls! 

<p>Keep in mind that the science-fiction Bladerunneresque appearance is just
the default.  Enlightenment is a framework and could be configured in a
variety of ways, depending upon taste (and how much time you're willing to
spend!).  Luckily (if you have patience), someone will eventually come up with
a configuration which will suit you. or at least be close.  Interest seems to
be growing in this window-manager lately (judging by the volume of messages in
the mailing list) and it may yet evolve into a community-supported
window-manager, such as Fvwm2 or Afterstep.  It's been released under the Gnu
license, but so far Carsten Haitzler is the sole developer.

<H1>Visual Music: The Linux Port of Cthugha</h1>
<H4>By Larry Ayers,
<a href="mailto:layers@vax2.rainis.net">layers@vax2.rainis.net</a></H4>
</center>

<P> <hr> <P> 
<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>Around 1993 Kevin Burfitt, an Australian computer science student, began
developing a computer program which would transform recorded music into moving
colored patterns.  Programs such as this had been in use for some time,
typically as an adjunct to a rock concert, i.e. part of the "light show".
This program was originally written for DOS, though before long it began to
acquire a trait common to software in the unix world: a multitude of options
and parameters.

<p>Kevin must be a fan of the early 20th-century horror writer
H.P. Lovecraft.  How else to account for the distinctive appellation "Cthugha" 
which he gave his program?  In the Lovecraft stories Cthugha is the name given 
to a horrific "elder god" which manifested itself to humans in the form of
shifting colored lights.  (This doesn't sound too horrific, but Lovecraft
could make a loaf of bread seem sinister!)

<p>Cthugha has from the early days been available under the aegis of
the Gnu General Public License,  making the source freely available.  This
opened the door for many other programmers scattered throughout the world who
became involved with the project.  Sound familiar?  Ports of the
program are now available for the PowerMac, Win95 (in development), and of
course Linux.  <a href="mailto: k3096e5@c210.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at">Harald
Deischinger</a> is responsible for the Linux port.  He recently released a new 
version (0.9) which is available from the following sites:<br>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound">Sunsite (may still 
      be in /pub/Linux/Incoming)</a>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.afn.org/cthugha/linux">The main Cthugha site</a>
</ul>

<center><h3>What Cthugha Does</h3></center>

<p>The input to the program can be any audio source, such as a microphone, a
CDROM drive (though you must have the drive connected to your soundcard), or
even a sound file.   Cthugha takes the digital audio information and, after
passing the data stream through any combination of filters, displays it to the 
screen in real time.  The keyboard is used to change the various parameters
either specifically or randomly.  The simplest displays resemble the screen of 
an oscilloscope being fed audio data (Cthugha has been called "an
oscilloscope on acid") but as more optional filters are added the display
becomes baroquely intricate.  If too many filters are active the
resulting images can be chaotic, with little discernible relation to the sound 
being processed.  

<center><h3>Running Cthugha</h3></center>

<p>The Linux version of Cthugha is compiled into two executables: cthugha,
which is a console application (using Svgalib), and xcthugha, which runs
either in an X-window or as a full-screen X application using the new DGA
extensions.  This last requires XFree86 3.2 or later.  Xcthugha can also be
run as a screensaver;  in former releases this was a separate executable.

<p>In this release the X11 version runs faster and smoother than in earlier
releases, but I still prefer the console version.  It's the quickest and most
responsive of the three interfaces and (in my experience) the only usable
version on a machine less powerful than a mid-range Pentium.

<p>Running Cthugha reminds me of playing a musical instrument.  The first
attempts aren't consistently pleasant, but with practice a measure of control
is gained.  Orchestral or loud rock music can benefit from
low gain settings, which help to produce a non-chaotic display.  The good sort of
recording to start with is music with few voices or tracks.  A vocalist with
minimal accompaniment or solo instrumental music give good results
while you gain a feel for the program.

<p>Cthugha comes with several "translation tables"; these are
filters which map the display to various moving patterns, such as spirals or
the appearance of traveling through a starfield.  I don't use them much, as it
seems to me they obscure the relationship between the music and the display.
The tables also tend to increase CPU usage.  Try them and see what you think,
as they seem to be popular with other Cthugha users.

<p>The other filter categories are more useful. The "wave" filters control the
general shape of the sound waves.  These run the gamut from basic oscilloscope
sine and square waves to angular lightning-like patterns or floating clusters
of fire-flies.  The "flame" filters add to the waves trailing clouds of glory
(I've always wanted to use that phrase in a non-ironic sense!).

<p>Using a microphone as input is fun, especially if there are kids around.
Seeing your voice represented as billowing clouds of iridescent plasma is
novel, to say the least.  Various musical instruments are interesting to try
as well; if one person plays the instrument while the other keys in parameters,
a combination which seems to reflect the character of the melody can often
be found.  If you should happen upon a combination of settings which results
in a particularly pleasing screen just press the <b>a</b> key and those
settings are entered into your Cthugha initialization file.

<p>Another option is the Fast Fourier Transform, an algorithm which gives an
entirely different look to the sound; it's hard to describe, but FFT seems
more three-dimensional and subtle.  The sampling rate should be reduced to
22000 hz. (from the default of 44000 hz.) since FFT adds one more level of
computation to the sound-translation process.

<p>Kevin Burfitt's decision to use the Fractint 256-color palette file as the
Cthugha palette file format was fortuitous.  Over the years Fractint users
have come up with a multitude of palette files among which can be found
palettes to please anyone's taste.  The Fractint fractal generator includes a
handy palette-file editor which can be used to create or modify palettes for
Cthugha.  I'm not sure if the palette editor is included with Xfractint -- I
mostly use the DOS Fractint in a Dosemu  console session.

<p>Here are a couple of screen-shots of xcthugha running in a 320x200
window:<br>
<hr>
<img  src="../gx/ayers/cthugha3.gif" alt="Cthugha image #1">

<img  src="../gx/ayers/cthugha4.gif" alt="Cthugha image #2">
<hr>
<p>These are snapshots, of course, and show little of the dynamic quality of
Cthugha reacting to the music.  The above images, by the way,
are of an old recording of Sarah Vaughan singing with piano accompaniment.

<p>After I finish these Gazette articles and get them uploaded to SSC,
I can usually count on a URL changing or a newer version of a program being
released.  Sometimes that very day!  The Gazette readers are also quick to let
me know of any factual errors I've made.  I've accumulated
several of these corrections and updates and shall present them here.

I received a letter from the maintainer of the Debian GV package:<br><pre>

       Hello Larry!

       I enjoyed reading your article, but there are two remarks I want to
       make:

       - Your screen capture is one of the one modified gv that works with
       all Athena Widgets, including the standard one. These modifications
       were made by me (although it wasn't very hard once I realized how
       well Johannes separated the Xaw3d stuff from the rest).
       It would have been better to have a screen capture using libXaw3d, as
       that is the standard look and feel. The last statement about having
       to have Xaw3d is not very convincing this way.
      - There is a gv homepage now:
                   <a href="http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/">
                    http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/</a>

      This page currently features gv version 3, which can no longer be
       used without libXaw3d. The last version of gv supporting standard
       Xaw was 2.9.4 which will soon be available on a debian archive site.
       Version 3 is even better than version 2 with respect to look and feel
       (one of the first really convincing applications using Xaw3d, IMO)
       and an improved postscript scanner.

      While I'm sure that it isn't possible to change/add to the article,
      there could be a short notice in the next gazette.

              Helmut

<center><h3>FileRunner</h3></center>

<p>FileRunner has been updated several times since I reviewed it several
months ago.  The latest version, 2.3, has improved FTP capabilities (including
the option of downloading files with a separate background process).  I must
confess I'm addicted to this file-manager.  Once you get the hang of it file
manipulation and directory traversals become so speedy that using it as
<b>root</b> can be risky!  Check the <a
href="http://www.cd.chalmers.se/~hch/filerunner.html"> FileRunner WWW
site</a> for latest releases and news.

<p>Here's an example of a user-configured action-button for FileRunner, which
will mostly interest XEmacs users (though it could probably be adapted easily
for use with GNU Emacs).  Create a file in the <b>~/.fr</b> directory named
<b>cmds</b>,  then enter this text into it:<pre><code>

# This is an example of user-defined commands. This file should be named
# cmds and placed in your ~/.fr directory. It will then be read by 
# FileRunner at startup.  Versions of FileRunner prior to 2.3 need to have
#the file named .fr_cmds and placed directly in the home directory.

# This list should contain all user-defined commands formatted as:
# { { &lt;button-title&gt; &lt;procedure-name&gt; } {..} {..} }
set config(usercommands) { 
    { XEmacs xemacs }
 }
#
proc xemacs { filelist srcdir destdir } {
  cd $srcdir
#  set l {}
  foreach f $filelist {
  exec gnuclient -q $f
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For this to work, you must have <i>gnuserv</i> running; this can be started
from your <i>~/.xemacs-options</i> file by including the line<br>
<code>(gnuserv-start)</code><br> in the file. What this button does is send
the files you've selected to an already-running XEmacs process (I usually have
one running in a different virtual desktop than the one FileRunner is using).
XEmacs will then open up a new frame in your current desktop with the file(s)
displayed in it.  This is handy for browsing source code.

<center><h3>wm2 and wmx </h3></center>

<p>In LG #14 I wrote about the minimalist window-manager wm2, written by
British programmer Chris Cannam.  Since then wm2 has spawned a variant, known
as wmx.  Evidently Mr. Cannam felt that spartan wm2 was becoming decadently
featureful.  Wm2 was stripped down to the bare minimum; no more
frame-background pixmaps,etc.  Wmx is just wm2 with the afore-mentioned
pixmaps and a basic virtual-desktop utility.  It has one more feature which I
thought was very cleverly designed: if you click the middle mouse button on
the desktop an application menu appears.  Unlike most window-managers, the
entries on the menu are a snap to set up.  Simply create a subdirectory
stemming from your home directory called <i>.wmx</i> and symlink executables
to it.  This can be even done while wmx is running.  Whatever appears in
<i>~/.wmx</i> will appear in the menu.  The menu can be configured with a
transparent background so that it has a very stylish and spare appearance.  As
with wm2 the configuration can only be changed by recompiling, but this can be
done very quickly as the source is not large or complex.  Source for either
wm2 or wmx can be obtained from 
<a href="http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~cannam/wm2.html">
the wm2 web-site.</a>

<center><h3>Afterstep</h3></center>

<p>A reader pointed out an error in my description of the Afterstep
window-manager in LG #14.  Rather than being based on Fvwm2 code, Afterstep is 
based on Fvwm version 1 code.  Incidentally, pre-release 6 has been released
and is well worth a trial.  Several bugs have been fixed but the improved
documentation alone makes it worth the download. 

<center><h3>Xvile</h3></center>

<p>Lately it seems that a fad is sweeping the insular world of vi-like
editors.   First the X versions of Elvis and Vim appeared with
pull-down menus; now it appears that Xvile will soon have a menubar as well.      
If <b>a:</b> you like vile/xvile and <b>b:</b> you have the Motif libs
installed, you may want to take a look at the patches for vile 7.00 available
from the <a href="ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/vile/patches">Vile ftp site.</a>
The patches A through G need to be applied to the vile 7.0 source.  It looks
like the menu items will be fairly easy to set up, as they make use of the
standard vile functions.  An implementation for non-Motif X setups is
planned.  

<p>I have mixed feelings about GUI conveniences such as menus in a vi editor.
One of the appealing traits of these editors is the lack of such visible
features combined with a wide array of invisible and powerful commands.
Little overhead but great power and speed.  If you have to reach for the mouse 
and select a menu-item, why not use Nedit (for example) which is designed as a 
mouse-oriented editor?  On the other hand, how many users have had an
unpleasant first-time experience with vi and rejected it forever?  At 
least the menubar will have a "quit-ZZ" item, allowing a novice to end a
first session without having to desperately flee to another virtual console
and kill the vi process from afar! 

<center><h3>TkDesk</h3></center>

<p>The latest version of this versatile desktop/file manager can be found at
<a href="http://sun1.rrzn-user.uni-hannover.de/~zzhibol/tkdesk">the TkDesk home site.</a> Version 1.0b4 has been released and many
minor bugs have been fixed.  There are three patches available on the web-site 
which should be applied by users of the program.  Two of them are changes to
<i>*.tcl</i> files, whereas the third is a c-source-level change which
requires recompilation.  Debian users can instead install a patched TkDesk
package which is available from the <i>/bo/binary-i386/x11</i> directory of
ftp.debian.org and its mirrors.

<center><h3>The Midnight Commander</h3></center>

<p>For the past several months a beta development cycle has been underway in
preparation for the release of mc-3.1.5.  The recent releases (the latest as
of this writing is patchlevel 25) have been very stable and usable.  If you
use the Midnight Commander frequently it might be worth your while to try the
new version, as many improvements have been made.

<p>An internal editor has been incorporated into mc, though you still can
change the settings and use any console-mode external editor.  The FTP
capabilities of mc have been augmented and the Tk version has made great
strides and needs just a few more features to be the equal of the
classic console version.  mc now has the ability to dive into <i>*.rpm</i> and 
<i>*.deb</i> files in the same manner it has been able to do with <i>*.tgz</i> 
and <i>*.zip</i> files, allowing you to inspect their contents without
unpacking the archives.

<p>It's only available in source form, but it comes with a good configure script
and compiles easily here.  The source is available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/Midnight/devel">the mc home site</a>.

<center><h3>XEmacs Update</h3></center>

<p>Last month I wrote about the release of XEmacs 19.15.  The XEmacs team
didn't stop and rest on their laurels (probably because some unexpected
problems showed up after the release!);  beta releases of XEmacs 20.1 began
showing up about twice a week at <b>ftp.xemacs.org</b>.  It looked as if
version 20.1 was about to be released, but for some reason the release was
cancelled and they moved on to betas of 20.2.  I'm running beta 2 now,
and have found that several small problems with 19.15 have been fixed.  The
Customization utility works quite a bit better now, for one.  When 20.2 is
released I would recommend obtaining it, as it looks like it will be an
improvement over 19.15.  Another approach if you've already installed 19.15 is 
to visit <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/xemacs-19.15-patches/patch-page.html">
the XEmacs patches page</a>, which offers patches to upgrade 19.15 to
patchlevel 2.  The problems dealt with are described on the page; if the
patches concern modes or utilities you never use, there's no point in applying them.

<h3>Slackware Is Not For You (Or Maybe It Is)</h3>

<p>Welcome to the Slackware distribution of Linux! This chapter aims
to help the new Linux user or administrator evaluate Slackware,
plan a Slackware system, and install Slackware Linux. In it you'll
find an emphasis on careful planning rather than rushing into
an impetuous installation. A special worksheet is included to
help you "get it right the first time", which I hope will be especially
useful to overworked Unix administrators in busy environments.

<p>Whether or not to choose Slackware as the flavor of Linux you
will use is a serious consideration. It may seem like a trivial
decision now, but Linux boxes have a way of taking on more and
more responsibility in organizational computing environments.
Plenty of Linux <I>experiments</I> have evolved in their first
year to become mission-critical machines serving many more users
and purposes than originally intended. Slackware is one of the
most widely used distributions of Linux. When it comes to finding
the newest, easiest, or most carefully planned distribution of
Linux, Slackware may be "none of the above". Some background on
the life and times of Slackware put things into perspective.

<a name="history"></a>
<h3>A Quick History</h3>

<p>In 1993, SLS created one of the first organized distributions
of Linux. Although it was a great start, the SLS distribution
had many shortcomings (it didn't exactly work, for starters).
Slackware, a godsend from Patrick Volkerding, solved most of these
issues, was mirrored via FTP and pressed onto CD-ROMs the worldwide,
and quickly became the most widely used flavor of Linux. For a
while, Slackware was the only full-featured   Linux solution.
Other Linux distribution maintainers, both commercial and nonprofit,
have gradually developed distributions that are also well worth
your consideration.

<p>According to statistics maintained by the Linux Counter Project,
Slackware inhabits about 69% of all machines that run Linux. Slackware
is typically obtained via FTP or CD-ROM and installed on a 486-class
computer running at 66Mhz with about 16 MB of memory and 1050
MB of storage. More information about Linux use and the Linux
Counter Project is available on the World Wide Web.

<a href="http://domen.uninett.no/\~hta/linux/counter.html">http://domen.uninett.no/\~hta/linux/counter.html</a><br>

<p>By January 1994, Slackware had achieved such widespread use that
it earned a popular notoriety normally reserved for rock stars
and cult leaders. Gossip spread through the Usenet suggesting
that the entire Slackware project was the work of witches and
devil-worshippers!

"Linux, the free OS....except for your SOUL!  MOUHAHAHAHA!"

<p>
From: <a href="mailto:cajho@uno.edu">cajho@uno.edu</a><br> 
Date: 7 Jan 1994 15:48:07 GMT<br> 

<p>Jokes alluding to RFC 666, demonic daemons, and speculation that
Pat Volkerding was actually L. Ron Hubbard in disguise were rampant
in the threads that followed. The whole amusing incident probably
helped Slackware gain some market share:

   <p>I LOVE THIS!! 
   <p>I was browsing here to figure which version of Linux to install,
   but after this, I think that I hve no choice but to install Slackware
   now.


<p>
From: <a href="mailto:dsith@phantom.com">David Devejian</a><br> 
Date: 10 Jan 1994 04:57:41 GMT<br> 

<p>All folklore and kidding aside, Slackware is a wise and powerful
choice for your adventures in Linux, whether you are a hobbyist,
student, hacker, or system administrator in the making.

<a name="why"></a>
<h3>Why, Then?</h3>

<p>If you are a system administrator, you may already be dealing
with one or more key servers running Slackware. Unless you have
time to experiment at work, sticking to the tried-and-true distribution
may be the easiest way to go. If you expect to get help from Unix
literate friends and colleagues, better make sure they're running
something compatible-odds are they're running Slackware. Its shortcomings
are widely acknowledged, for the most part discovered, documented
and patched whenever possible. You can put together a Slackware
box, close the known security holes, and install some complementary
tools from the other Linux distributions to create an excellent
Unix server or desktop workstation, all in about half a day.

<p>If you are still undecided whether Slackware is the tastiest flavor
of Linux for you, have a look at the "Buyer's Guide"
published in the <I>Linux Journal</I>, which gives a thorough
comparison and evaluation of each major distribution. For a straightforward
listing of Linux flavors, have a look at the Linux Distribution HOWTO
on the Internet:<br>

<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Distribution-HOWTO.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Distribution-HOWTO.html</a><br>

<a name="planning"></a>
<h3>Planning</h3>

<p>Nine tenths of wisdom is timing. The right time to set up Slackware
is <I> after</I>you've carefully planned the installation <I>and
</I>alternatives in the unfortunate event of a problem. A well-planned
installation of Slackware will repay itself many times over in
the future, when the natural process of Linux evolution leads
you to add disk space, install a newer Slackware release, or jettison
any old, inferior operating systems that may linger on your drives.

<p>Like Unix, Slackware Linux tends to grow like a virus. If you
succeed in getting one Slackware box up and running, you're likely
to start infecting other computers that belong to your friends,
family, and coworkers. When this happens, you'll be grateful that
you at least took the time to think through this first setup-and
so will they!

<p>This section will help you decide...
<ul>
<li>if you've got what it takes (of course you do!)
<li>whether your computer hardware is ready to run Slackware Linux
<li>where and how to get Slackware Linux
<li>how to best arrange disks and file systems to protect your
work
<li>not to upgrade an older version of Slackware
<li>which packages of the distribution you want and need
<li>how you will handle installation problems (however unlikely)
</ul>
<h3>Literacy Required</h3>

<p>Linux is a powerful operating system, and with power comes responsibility.
Like Linux, the Slackware release treats you with the respect
you deserve as an intelligent human being. If you elect to wipe
out a few hard drives with a misplaced punctuation mark, so be
it. There are graceful and intelligent front-ends to Linux that
allow the average end-user to get lots of productive work done
without ever delving into the cryptic subtleties of Unix setup
and administration. But there's no such luck for you, the appointed
installation guru. If you're going to install Slackware, be forewarned
that you should know your IRQs from your RS232s and your SCSIs
from your IDEs.


<h3>Hardware Compatibility</h3>

<p>This is an essential element for planning any Linux installation. The only
Slackware-specific hardware issue is this: you must confirm that
the particular version (vintage, release) distribution of Slackware
you'll be installing from provides a <I>kernel and drivers to
support your hardware</I>. You're in great shape with just about
any IBM-compatible personal computer with an Intel CPU older than
the date on your Slackware distribution but younger than 1992
(built after 1992). If you have a bleeding-edge machine, you may
need to download a newer boot disk that includes an updated kernel
and drivers.

<p>For the latest information on <I>it general</I> Linux hardware compatibility,
check the Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO document on the World
Wide Web:<br>

<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html</a><br>

<p>To check for up-to-the minute Slackware news, such as which boot
kernels are available, you can look in this directory of the Slackware
home ftp site, ftp.cdrom.com:<br>

<a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware/patches/">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware/patches/</a><br>

<a name="thinking"></a>
<h3>Thinking Through Storage And File Systems</h3>

<p>Careful planning of file systems and the storage media upon which
they reside can spare you hours of painful juggling at a later
date. In particular, putting all of your custom administration
files, user homes, and local software onto dedicated partitions
or disks will allow you to upgrade Slackware on the root partition
with minimal disruption to your improvements to the system.

<h3>Multiple Operating Systems On One Hard Drive</h3>

<p>A typical personal computer has one fixed disk drive. If you're
a hobbyist or power user, you may already have installed more
than one Operating System on that drive. For example, your computer
may have shipped running MS-DOS or Windows 95 as a pre-loaded
operating system, after which you added another operating system
such as OS/2, NeXTstep, Geoworks, or Linux. To run multiple operating
systems from one drive, the disk is divided into separate areas
known as partitions. Each partition may contain a different operating
system. Once you've installed a second OS, you also need to install
a small program called a boot manager or OS loader that runs at
system startup time and offers you a choice of all the installed
operating systems.

<p>If you're adding Linux to a computer running a lesser OS, you
may elect to keep the old operating system around for kicks. Take
a look at the Linux Loader (LILO), a high-powered boot manager
that comes free with Slackware. The latest distribution of LILO
and its documentation are available via FTP from this URL:<br>

<a href="ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/linux/local/lilo/">ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/linus/local/lilo/</a><br>

An overview of LILO and how you can use it are easily gleaned
from the LILO Mini-HOWTO:<br>

<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/LILO">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/LILO/</a><br>

<h3>Designing a File System To Use Multiple Partitions</h3>

<p>In a simple world, you can set up Linux to run on a single disk
partition (or maybe two-one for swap). In a real-world, multi-user
Unix system, a single-drive file system setup creates unnecessary
risks and hassles you can avoid by distributing the file system
across multiple partitions. It's all the same to Unix, which views
the file system as a continuum of available space comprised of
all the disks and partitions "mounted" into various locations
on the file tree. 

<p>If you create a Slackware setup on only one drive partition, you
effectively put all of your eggs in one basket-one user may receive
an abundance of e-mail and overload the <tt>/var/mail</tt>
file system, another might store enormous files in their home area,
etc. As with many Unix quandaries, you have a choice of solutions
to control file system use, including quotas and user limits. Distributing
your Unix file system across multiple partitions and disks has
an extra benefit for Slackware users-it allows you to upgrade
the Slackware installation with a minimum of pain.

<p>The Linux file system standard puts the personal space of each
user into a subdirectory of <tt>/home</tt>. The user Linus
would typically have a home under <tt>/home/linus</tt>, the
user Patricia under <tt>/home/patricia</tt>, and so on. An
easy way to protect this file system during future upgrades is
to mount <tt>/home</tt> on a separate disk or partition. Same goes for
custom programs and resources you add to the off-the-shelf version
of Slackware-plan to put these on a separate disk mounted to <tt>/usr/local</tt>
and you'll have much less grief when it comes time to upgrade.
 
"Where things go"---or where they try to go unless you dictate otherwise---
in a Slackware box is determined by a standard file system layout,
called the <I>Linux File system Hierarchy Standard</I>. Read all
about it URL:<br>

<a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</a><br>

<h3>Designing a File System To Use Multiple Hard Drives</h3>

<p>In some settings, Linux boxes are assembled from leftover parts-"worthless"
386 and 486 motherboards, old grayscale monitors, and discarded
hard drives. You may need to link together several ancient 40MB
hard drives to come up with enough space to install Slackware.
In other environments using Linux, there are so many users and
such large development projects that several of the biggest, state-of-the-art
drives or drive arrays must be integrated to provide enough space.

<p>You can install Slackware onto more than one disk at once by
designating individual disks to hold specific parts of the Slackware
installation (just like using multiple partitions), creating a
logically continuous and unified file system.

<p>For an informed second opinion on partitioning, swap space setup,
fragmentation and inode size consult Kristian Koehntopp's <I>Partitions</I>
Mini-HOWTO via Internet URL:<br>

<a name="upgrade"></a>
<h3>Upgrade? Think Twice!</h3>

<p>24-Aug-95 NOTE: Trying to upgrade to ELF Slackware from a.out
Slackware will undoubtedly cause you all kinds of
problems. Don't do it.

<p><b>Patrick Volkerding</b>

<p>One thing we don't hear too often with Slackware is the U-word.
Slackware's setup program is designed to put a fresh operating
system onto empty hard disks or empty disk partitions. Installing
on top of a previous Slackware installation can erase your custom
applications and cause compatibility problems between updated
applications and older files on the same system. When Slackware
was first put together, everyone was a first-time Linux user,
and the system was always experimental-reinstalling the entire
operating system and applications was the norm in a developmental
system. Today, many institutions and businesses now run mission-critical
applications on Slackware Linux. In such environment, a simple
reboot is a planned activity and taking down the system and overwriting
all the user files or custom applications is absolutely unacceptable.

<p>So, if you cracked open these pages to plot an upgrade, better
think twice. If you're planning a first-time Slackware installation,
there are a few decisions you can make now that will ease upgrading
in the future:

<ul>
<li>assign <tt>/usr/local</tt> to be mounted from its own
separate drive or partition
<li>build and install all of your organization's custom applications
under the <tt>/usr/local</tt> area of the file system
<li>assign <tt>/home</tt> to be mounted from its own separate
drive or partition
<li>make sure all user "homes" are added under the <tt>/home</tt>
area of the file system
</ul>

<p>Teaching you how to finagle a Slackware upgrade is beyond the
scope of this chapter, but it is workable if you are an experienced
Unix administrator and you've taken the precautions above. There
is an Internet resource that claims to analyze your distribution
and bring it up to date across the Internet, you might want to
have a look at this URL if you're facing an upgrade situation:<br>

<a href="ftp://ftp.wsc.com/pub/freeware/linux/update.linux/">ftp://ftp.wsc.com/pub/freeware/linux/update.linux/</a><br> 

<p>Or read, weep, and learn from the upgrade expertise of Greg Louis
in his mini HOWTO document: <I>Upgrading Your Linux Distribution</I>,
available where finer LDP publications are mirrored:<br>

<h3>Select An Installation Method</h3>

<p>Slackware can be installed from a variety of media and network
sources to fit your needs and budget. Every installation method
will require you to have at least three floppy diskettes available
to get started.


<h3>CD-ROM</h3>

<p>Installation from CD-ROM is fast, popular, and convenient. Although
someone has to break down and pay for the initial purchase of
a CD-ROM, sharing CD's is <I>encouraged</I>. Because Linux and
the Slackware distribution are copylefted, you may make as many
copies as you like. CD-ROM installation is also a bit better practice
in terms of netiquette, since you're not hogging bandwidth for
an all-day FTP transfer. Finally, you may be grateful for the
extra utilities and documentation that accompany the CD-ROM, especially
if you run into installation hassles or need to add components
in the future.


<h3>Party!</h3>

<p>If you're a hobbyist (or want to watch a few dozen Slackware installs
before taking on the task at work), see if there is a LUG (Linux
User Group) in your area that sponsors install parties. Imagine
a roomful of generous and knowledgeable hackers uniting to share
CD-ROMs and expertise with other enthusiasts.


<p><b>FTP</b>

<p>According to the Linux Counter Project, FTP is still the most
popular way to obtain Linux by a narrow margin. Once you transfer
Slackware from the closest possible FTP mirror, you'll still need
to put the Slackware 'disk sets' onto installation media such
as a hard drive partition or laboriously copy them onto 50-odd
floppy diskettes.


<p><b>NFS</b>

<p>In a networked environment, it is possible to install Slackware
on a shared file system and allow everyone on the Local net to
attach to this shared location and install. If you have the technical
know-how or a geeked out system administrator who is Linux-literate,
this is a great way to go. The initial distribution of Slackware
can be added to the network via CD-ROM, FTP, Loading floppies,
tape, or even via a remote NFS share across the Internet! For
details on such a remote share, see these URLs:
<ul>  
<li><a href="http://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/sunsite/access/nfs.html">http://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/sunsite/access/nfs.html</a>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware/MIRRORS.TXT">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware/MIRRORS.TXT</a>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.us.es/archive/nfs.html">http://www.cs.us.es/archive/nfs.html</a>
</ul>

<p><b>Floppy</b>

<p>It's time consuming, but it works-you can buy or create the pile
of floppies needed to install Slackware and then feed them into
your box one-by-one when prompted. Slackware 'disk sets' are actually
designed and arranged to fit floppy diskettes. If you happen to
have a huge stack of recycled high-density floppy diskettes at
your disposal, this can be the most economical way to go.


<p><b>Hard Disk</b>

<p>This is the way to do it if you've transferred the Slackware distribution
across the Internet via FTP-you'll escape the floppy trap by merely
creating boot, root, and rescue diskettes. It requires you to
have an extra disk or disk partition with extra space to hold
the Slackware files during installation (you can erase them afterwards).
Installation from the hard drive is also a workaround if you bought
the CD but your CD-ROM drive is not supported by any of the Linux
kernels that come with the Slackware CD. You can use your present
operating system to transfer the Slackware files onto spare hard
disk space, then boot into the Slackware installation.


<p><b>Tape</b>

<p>Still experimental as of this writing, tape offers a great compromise
of speed and economy when installing Slackware-worth considering
if a friend with compatible tape drive can dupe a CD or FTP archive
for you. Get the latest details from the TAPE section of the INSTALL.TXT
file that accompanies your Slackware distribution.

<a name="boot"></a>
<h3>Boot Disks: Always a Good Thing</h3>

<p>Even if you're gifted with a direct T-3 Internet connection that
allows you to suck up a new distribution of Slackware right off
the 'net, you'll be wise to start by building the two Slackware
setup disks (boot and root) before proceeding. In the event of
an unfortunate accident (power outage, feline friends traversing
the keyboard, or even human error), these two little disks, in
the hands of an experienced Unix hacker, may be able to revive
your system or at least rescue your personal files.


<h3>Prepare To Be Questioned (There Will Be a Quiz...)</h3>

<p>During the installation, must choose which disk sets (Slackware
lingo for collections of software) and individual programs to
install. You can usually just accept the default recommendation
of whether or not a package is worth having. A few setup decisions
are <I>crucial</I>. Mid-installation is no time to decide you
want to boot back into OS/2 and look up what kind of graphics
chip your video card uses, which network card you've got in there,
or whether you'll be needing a SCSI or an IDE kernel to get started.


<h3>Contingency Plan: Food For Thought</h3>

<p>I've often blurted out to a supervisor, "Oh sure, I can have
it up and running in a few hours." Famous last words.
If anyone else has a stake in the Slackware computer's health,
you owe it to them and yourself to think through a less-than-perfect
installation attempt:

<ol>
<li>What's your plan in the unfortunate event that Slackware Linux
doesn't run perfectly on your system?
<li>Do you have the necessary tools and know-how to revert to
your previous operating system?
<li>Do you have a backup of your old system on-hand, and do you
have experience restoring entire systems?
<li>Is this a shared computer? Will people be coming into work
on Monday expecting to log in to the system you just hosed?
<li>Where is the closest Unix expert with Slackware Linux expertise?
Can you call on them to help you in the event of a problem setting
up or upgrading a critical Slackware system?
</ol>

<a name="slack1"></a>
<h3>Slackware Setup Worksheet</h3>

<p>After the files are all copied, Slackware can go on to do most
of the system and network configuration, if you're ready. To help
you plan your decisions, Section 3 consists of a worksheet derived
from the text-based Slackware setup program. You can use this
worksheet to record answers in advance (while your computer is
still working!), so you'll be ready with the necessary details-partitions,
IP addresses, modem and mouse IRQs, host and domain names, and
others that you're required to provide during setup.
                                 
<ol>
<li><B>Keyboard:</B> Slackware setup will
want to know if you need to 
remap your keyboard to something other
than a standard USA 101 key layout? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<li><B>Swap Configuration:</B>Do you have one or more
partitions prepared as type 82 (Linux Swap)? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<li>Do you want setup to use mkswap on your swap
partitions? Most likely "yes", 
unless you have less than 4MB of RAM and have already done this 
to help setup work better. <I>Yes or No</I>.


<li><B>Prepare Main Linux Partition:</B> Setup will list any
partitions marked as type 83 (Linux Native) and ask
which one to use for the root (/) of the Linux
file system. Use a format like 
<tt>/dev/hda3</tt> or whatever the device name is. <I>Yes or No</I>.


<p>Last chance to back out! When using the install from
scratch option, 
you must install to a blank partition. If you have not 
already formatted it manually, then you must format it 
when prompted.  Enter <tt>I</tt> to install from scratch, or 
<tt>a</tt> to add software to your existing system.


<li>(Re)format the main Linux partition. Would you like
to format this partition? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<p>Ext2fs defaults to one inode per 4096 bytes of drive
space. If you're going to have many small files on
your drive, you may need more inodes (one is used
for each file entry). You can change the density to
one inode per 2048 bytes, or even per 1024 bytes.
Enter <tt>2048</tt> or <tt>1024</tt>, or just hit <tt>Enter</tt> to accept
the default of 4096. 4096, 2048, or 1024.


<li><B>Prepare Additional Linux Partitions:</B> You can mount
some other partitions for <tt>/usr</tt> or <tt>/usr/X11</tt> or
whatever (<tt>/tmp</tt>---you name it). Would you like to use
some of the other Linux partitions to mount some of
your directories? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<p>These are your Linux partitions (<I>partition list displayed</I>).
These partitions are already in use
(<I>partition list displayed</I>). Enter the
partition you would like to use, or type <tt>q</tt> to quit
adding new partitions. Use a format such as:
<tt>/dev/hda3</tt> or whatever the device name is.

<I>Partition name or <tt>quit</tt></I>

<li>Would you like to format this
partition? Yes, No, or Check Sections, too</I>


<li>Now this new partition must be mounted somewhere in                    
your new directory tree. For example, if you want to                   
put it under <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>, then respond: <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>
Where would you like to mount this new partition?                      

<I>Mount point</I>

<li>Would you like to mount some more additional
partitions? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<p><B>DOS and OS/2 Partition Setup:</B> The following DOS FAT
or OS/2 HPFS partitions were found: (<I>partition list displayed</I>).
<li>Would you like to set up some of these                      
partitions to be visible from Linux? <I>Yes or No</I>.                                  


<li>Please enter the partition you would like to access                    
from Linux, or type <tt>q</tt> to quit adding new                             
partitions. Use a format such as: <tt>/dev/hda3</tt> or
whatever the device name is.

<I>Partition name or Quit</I>

<li>Now this new partition must be mounted somewhere in                    
your directory tree. Please enter the directory                        
under which you would like to put it. for instance,   
you might want to reply <tt>/dosc</tt>, <tt>/dosd</tt>, or something
like that. Where would you like to mount this partition?

<I>Mount point</I>

<li><B>Source Media Selection:</B>
<ol>               
<li>Install from a hard drive partition.
<li>Install from floppy disks.
<li>Install via NFS.
<li>Install from a pre-mounted directory.
<li>Install from CD-ROM.

</ol>
<I>1, 2, 3, 4, or 5</I>

<li><B>Install from a hard drive partition:</B> To install    
directly from the hard disk you must have a
partition with a directory containing the Slackware
distribution such that each disk other than the boot
disk is contained in a subdirectory. For example, if
the distribution is in <tt>/stuff/slack</tt>, then you need to have 
directories named <tt>/stuff/slack/a1</tt>,
<tt>/stuff/slack/a2</tt>, and so on, each containing the
files that would be on that disk. You may install
from DOS, HPFS, or Linux partitions. Enter the
partition where the Slackware sources can be found,
or <tt>p</tt> to see a partition list.

<I>Partition name or Partition list</I>

<li>What directory on this partition can the Slackware                     
sources be found. In the example above, this would                     
be: <tt>/stuff/slack</tt>. What directory are the Slackware
sources in?

<I>Directory name</I>

<li>What type of file system does your Slackware source
partition contain?
<ol>
<li>FAT (MS-DOS, DR-DOS, OS/2)
<li>Linux Second Extended File System
<li>Linux Xiafs
<li>Linux MINIX
<li>OS/2 HPFS
</ol>
<I>1, 2, 3, 4, or 5</I>

<li><B>Install from a pre-mounted directory:</B> OK, we will
install from a directory that is currently mounted.
This can be mounted normally or through NFS. You
need to specify the name of the directory that
contains the subdirectories for each source disk.
Which directory would you like to install from?

<I>Directory name</I>

<li><B>Install from floppy disks:</B> The base Slackware series
(A) can be installed from 1.2M or 1.44M media. Most
of the other disks will not fit on 1.2M media, but
can be downloaded to your hard drive and installed                     
from there later. Which drive would you like to                        
install from (1/2/3/4)?

<ol>                                  
<li><tt>/dev/fd0u1440</tt> (1.44M drive a:)
<li><tt>/dev/fd1u1440</tt> (1.44M drive b:)
<li><tt>/dev/fd0h1200</tt> (1.2M drive a:)
<li><tt>/dev/fd1h1200</tt> (1.2M drive b:)
</ol>
<I>1, 2, 3, or 4</I>

<li><B>Install via NFS:</B> You're running off the hard drive
file system. Is this machine currently running on the
network you plan to install from? If so, we won't
try to reconfigure your ethernet card. Are you
up-and-running on the network? Yes or No. 


<li>You will need to enter the IP address you wish to                      
assign to this machine. Example: 111.112.113.114.                      
What is your IP address? <I>IP address</I>


<li>Now we need to know your netmask. Typically this                       
will be 255.255.255.0. What is your netmask?                           

<I>IP address</I>

<li>Do you have a gateway? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<li>What is your gateway address?

<I>IP address</I>

<p>Good! We're all set on the local end, but now we                       
need to know where to find the software packages to                    
install. First, we need the IP address of the
machine where the Slackware sources are stored.                        
Since you're already running on the network, you                       
should be able to use the hostname instead of an IP                    
address if you wish. 

<li>What is the IP address of your                    
NFS server?                                                            

<I>IP address</I>

<p>There must be a directory on the server with the
Slackware sources for each disk in subdirectories
beneath it. Setup needs to know the name of the
directory on your server that contains the disk
subdirectories. For example, if your A3 disk is
found at <tt>/slackware/a3</tt>, then you would respond:
<tt>/slackware</tt>. 

<li>What is the Slackware source directory?

<I>Directory name</I>

<li><B>Install from CD-ROM:</B> What type of CD-ROM drive do you have?
<ol>
<li>Works with most ATAPI/IDE CD drives <tt>/dev/hd*</tt>
<li>SCSI <tt>/dev/scd0</tt> or <tt>/dev/scd1</tt>
<li>Sony CDU31A/CDU33A <tt>/dev/sonycd</tt>
<li>Sony 531/535 <tt>/dev/cdu535</tt>
<li>Mitsumi, proprietary interface---not IDE <tt>/dev/mcd</tt>
<li>New Mitsumi, also not IDE <tt> /dev/mcdx0</tt>
<li>Sound Blaster Pro/Panasonic <tt>/dev/sbpcd</tt>
<li>Aztech/Orchid/Okano/Wearnes <tt>/dev/aztcd</tt>
<li>Phillips and some ProAudioSpectrum16 <tt>/dev/cm206cd</tt>
<li>Goldstar R420 <tt> /dev/gscd</tt>
<li>Optics Storage 8000 <tt> /dev/optcd</tt>
<li>Sanyo CDR-H94 + ISP16 soundcard <tt> /dev/sjcd</tt>
<li>Try to scan for your CD drive
</ol>
<I>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13</I>

<B>IDE CD-ROM:</B> Enter the device name that represents
your IDE CD-ROM drive. This will probably be one of
these (in the order of most to least likely):
<tt>/dev/hdb /dev/hdc /dev/hdd /dev/hde /dev/hdf
/dev/hdg /dev/hdh /dev/hda</tt>

<I>Device name</I>

<li><B>SCSI CD-ROM:</B> Which SCSI CD-ROM are you using?
If you're not sure, select <tt>/dev/scd0</tt>.

<tt>1. /dev/scd0<br>
2. /dev/scd1</br></tt>


<li><B>Installation method:</B> With the Slackware CD, you can
run most of the system from the CD if you're short
of drive space or if you just want to test Linux
without going through a complete installation. Which
type of installation do you want (slakware or
slaktest)?
<ul>
<li>[slakware] Normal installation to hard drive                          
<li>[slaktest] Link <tt>family /usr-$>$/cdrom/live/usr</tt> to run mostly from CD-ROM
</ul>

<I>slakware or slaktext</I>

<li><B>Series Selection:</B> Identify which Packages you plan
to install. You may specify any combination of disk
sets at the prompt which follows. For example, to
install the base system, the base X Window System,
and the Tcl toolkit, you would enter: a x tcl Which
disk sets do you want to install?
<ul>
<li>[A] Base Linux system
<li>[AP] Various applications that do not need X
<li>[D] Program Development (C, C++, Kernel source, Lisp, Perl, etc.)
<li>[E] GNU Emacs
<li>[F] FAQ lists
<li>[K] Linux kernel source
<li>[N] Networking (TCP/IP, UUCP, Mail)
<li>[Q] Extra kernels with special drivers (needed for non-SCSI CD)
<li>[T] TeX
<li>[TCL] Tcl/Tk/TclX, Tcl language, and Tk toolkit for developing X apps
<li>[X] Xfree86 Base X Window System
<li>[XAP] X Window Applications
<li>[XD] Xfree86 X11 server development system
<li>[XV] Xview (OpenLook virtual Window Manager, apps)
<li>[Y] Games (that do not require X)
</ul>

<I>Any combination of a ap d e f k n q t tcl x xap xd xv y and other disk sets offered, separated by spaces</I>

<li><B>Software Installation:</B> Next, software packages are
going to be transferred on to your hard drive. If
this is your first time installing Linux, you should
probably use PROMPT mode. This will follow a
defaults file on the first disk of each series you
install that will ensure that required packages are
installed automatically. You will be prompted for
the installation of other packages.  If you don't
use PROMPT mode, the install program will just go
ahead and install everything from the disk sets you
have selected.  Do you want to use PROMPT mode
(y/n)?


<p>These defaults are user definable---you may set any
package to be added or skipped automatically by
editing your choices into a file called TAGFILE that
will be found on the first disk of each series.
There will also be a copy of the original tagfile
called TAGFILE.ORG available in case you want to
restore the default settings. The tagfile contains
all the instructions needed to completely automate
your installation. 

<li>Would you like to use a special
tagfile extension? 

<p>You can specify an extension
consisting of a "." followed by any combination of 3
characters other than <tt>tgz</tt>. For instance, I specify
'.pat', and then whenever any tagfiles called
'tagfile.pat' are found during the installation they
are used instead of the default "tagfile" files. If
the install program does not find tagfiles with the
custom extension, it will use the default tagfiles.
Enter your custom tagfile extension (including the
leading ("."), or just press <tt>Enter</tt> to continue
without a custom extension.

<I>Tagfile extension <tt>Enter</tt></I>

<li><B>Extra Configuration:</B> If you wish, you may now go
through the options to reconfigure your hardware,
make a bootdisk, and install LILO. If you've
installed a new kernel image, you should go through
these steps again. Otherwise, it's up to you.


<li><B>Boot Disk Creation:</B> It is recommended that you make
a boot disk. Would you like to do this? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<p>Now put a formatted floppy in your boot drive. This
will be made into your Linux boot disk. Use this to
boot Linux until LILO has been configured to boot
from the hard drive. Any data on the target disk
will be destroyed. Insert the disk and press
<tt>Return</tt>, or <tt>s</tt> if you want to skip this step.


<li><B>Modem Setup:</B> A link in <tt>/dev</tt> will be created from
your callout device (cua0, cua1, cua2, cua3) to
<tt>/dev/modem</tt>. You can change this link later if you
put your modem on a different port. Would you like
to set up your modem? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<li>These are the standard serial I/O devices, 
Which
device is your modem attached to (0, 1, 2, 3)?
<ol>
<li><tt>/dev/ttyS0</tt> (or COM1: under DOS)
<li><tt>/dev/ttyS1</tt> (or COM2: under DOS)
<li><tt>/dev/ttyS2</tt> (or COM3: under DOS)
<li><tt>/dev/ttyS3</tt> (or COM4: under DOS)
</ol>

<li><B>Mouse Setup:</B> A link will be created in <tt>/dev</tt> from
your mouse device to <tt>/dev/mouse</tt>. You can change this
link later if you switch to a different type of
mouse. Would you like to set up your mouse? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<li>These types are supported. Which type of mouse do
you have (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)?
<ol>                
<li>Microsoft compatible serial mouse
<li>QuickPort or PS/2 style mouse (Auxiliary port)
<li>Logitech Bus Mouse
<li>ATI XL Bus Mouse
<li>Microsoft Bus Mouse
<li>Mouse Systems serial mouse
<li>Logitech (MouseMan) serial mouse
</ol>

<I>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7</I>

<li>These are the standard serial I/O devices. Which
device is your mouse attached to (0, 1, 2, 3)?
<ol>               
<li><tt>/dev/ttyS0</tt> (or COM1: under DOS)
<li><tt>/dev/ttyS1</tt> (or COM2: under DOS)
<li><tt>/dev/ttyS2</tt> (or COM3: under DOS)
<li><tt>/dev/ttyS3</tt> (or COM4: under DOS)
</ol>              

<I>0, 1, 2, or 3</I>

<li><B>Network Configuration:</B> Now we will attempt to
configure your mail and TCP/IP. This process
probably won't work on all possible network
configurations, but should give you a good start.
You will be able to reconfigure your system at any
time by typing netconfig. First, we'll need the name
you'd like to give your host. Only the base hostname
is needed right now (not the domain).  Enter the
hostname.

<I>Hostname</I>

<p>Now, we need the domain name. Do not supply a
leading "." Enter the domain name.


<I>Domain name</I>

<p>If you only plan to use TCP/IP through loopback,
then your IP address will be 127.0.0.1 and we can
skip a lot of the following questions. Do you plan
to ONLY use loopback? Yes or No.


<p>Enter your IP address for the local machine.
Example: 111.112.113.114. Enter the IP address for this
machine (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd).

<I>IP address</I>

<li>Enter your gateway address, such as 111.112.113.1.
If you don't have a gateway, you can edit
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 later,or you can probably get
away with entering your own IP address here. Enter the
gateway address (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd).

<I>IP address</I>

<li>Enter your netmask. This will generally look
something like this: 255.255.255.0. Enter the netmask
(aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd).

<I>IP address</I>

<li>Will you be accessing a nameserver? <I>Yes or No</I>.


<li>Please give the IP address of the name server to
use. You can add more Domain Name Servers by editing
<tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>. Name Server for your domain
(aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd)?                 

<I>HIP address</I>
</ul>
<p>You may now reboot your computer by pressing <tt>Ctrl+Alt+Delete</tt>.
If you installed LILO, remove the boot disk from your computer
before rebooting. Don't forget to create you <tt>{/etc/fsta</tt>
if you don't have one! 



<h3>Making Slackware Happen</h3>

<p>If you've taken the time to plot and plan as recommended in the
preceding sections, then the actual installation will be a piece
of cake. There isn't much writing needed to explain the actual
process of loading Slackware onto your computer(s). You just follow
the steps to build boot and root diskettes, then answer a long
series of questions asked by the menu-driven Slackware installation
program. If you've completed the Slackware Installation Worksheet,
these questions will be familiar and everything will run smoothly.


<h3>Build Some Boot Disks</h3>

<p>Choose Your Kernel

<p>When installing Slackware Linux, you must create a boot diskette
with a Linux kernel that is specially prepared to recognize your
system hardware. For example, to install Slackware from an IDE
CD-ROM drive onto a SCSI hard drive, the kernel that you put onto
the boot diskette will need to have drivers for your SCSI card
and your IDE CD-ROM drive.

<p>The kernels are stored as compressed <I>binary image</I> files
that you can access from most any operating system to create a
Slackware Boot diskette. On the Slackware FTP site, CD-ROM, or
NFS mount, you'll find a subdirectory called bootdsks.144-containing
1.44 MB kernel images for creating boot disks on 1.44MB high density
3.5'' floppy diskettes. If you're working from a 5.25'' floppy
diskette drive, look in a directory called bootdsks.12 for
kernel images that will fit the smaller diskette format.

<p>Table 2 provides a quick reference of the kernel images available
as we went to press. Information and up-to-date boot disk image
information is available from this URL:

<p><b>Unix Operating Systems</b>

<p>If you have the Slackware kernel images on a Unix host that has
a floppy drive, you can quickly create the necessary boot and
root diskettes using Unix commands. You can use the dd
command. The example below which puts the scsi.s
boot kernel image onto the floppy device rfd0:

<tt>dd if=scsi.s of=/dev/rfd0 obs=18k</tt>

<p>You'll need to repeat this process with one of the root disk images
onto a second floppy diskette.


<p>DOS, OS/2, MS-Windows 95 \& NT

<p>Slackware bundles a utility called rawrite.exe that
will generate boot and root diskettes under DOS-literate operating
systems. To write the scsi.s kernel image onto the
formatted, high-density diskette in your A:$\backslash$ diskette
drive, issue the following command:

<tt>RAWRITE SCSI.S A:</tt>

<p>You'll need to repeat this process with one of the root disk images
onto a second floppy diskette.


<h3>Boot Into Action</h3>


<p>Here's the big anticlimax. After all this planning, preparation,
and partitioning, you're in the home stretch. Make sure the boot
floppy is in the diskette drive, and restart your computer. Now
is a good time to go get some coffee (or whatever you like to
keep you company) and return to the machine ready to play the
part of a button-pushing drone, answering yes-no questions for
an hour or so.

<p>Log in as root (no password) and type setup
or setup.tty

<a name="slack2"></a>
<h3>Slackware Setup Program</h3>


<p>Slackware comes with two versions of an excellent setup program.
One is a colorful, dialog-based, menu-driven version. An alternative
setup, setup.tty, is a text-only version of the installation
that you may actually prefer, because detailed diagnostics and
error messages will stay on the screen and not be erased by the
next dialog box, which happens in the color version. If you're
attempting a Slackware setup on sketchy hardware, I strongly recommend
the less colorful setup.tty routine. If you don't
know much about Unix and would feel more comfortable with an attractive.
``clean'' interface to the same setup process, then by all means
go for the beautiful setup.

 
<h3><center>Slackware96 Linux Setup (version HD-3.1.0)</center></center></h3>

<h3>Welcome to Slackware Linux Setup</h3>

<p>Hint: If you have trouble using the arrow keys on your keyboard,
you can use '+', '-', and TAB instead. Which option would you like?
       
<ul>   
<li>	  HELP:       Read the Slackware Setup HELP file
<li>      KEYMAP:     Remap your keyboard
<li>      MAKE TAGS:  Tagfile customization program
<li>      TARGET:     Select target directory [now: / ]
<li>      SOURCE:     Select source media
<li>      DISK SETS:  Decide which disk sets you wish to install
<li>      INSTALL:    Install selected disk sets
<li>      CONFIGURE:  Reconfigure your Linux system
<li>      PKGTOOL:    Install or remove packages with Pkgtool
<li>      EXIT:       Exit Slackware Linux Setup
                            OK        Cancel
</ul>
<p>To transfer Slackware onto your system from here should involve
little more than selecting what you want off the menus. By filling
out the Section 3 worksheet in advance, you should be able progress
quickly through each menu in order, until you reach the INSTALL
option, at which point things may s  l  o  w down: you are advised
to select the PROMPT feature and <I>read</I> about each software
package, deciding whether or not you'd like it to end up on your
Slackware system. The last part of a regular setup is the CONFIGURE
section on the setup menu, and the questions you must answer bear
a striking resemblance to the second half of the Section 3 worksheet.



<h3>Is That All?</h3>

<p>Definitely not! At this point, you've either got some annoying
obstacle that is preventing the setup from completing, or more
likely, you're looking at the root prompt

<tt>darkstar\~\#</tt><br> 
 
and wondering "What Next?" 

<p>Well, if you're plagued by problems, you'll want to proceed directly
to the next section on troubleshooting. If things appear to be
in working order, you've still got some details to attend to.
Sort of like purchasing a new automobile-after you've selected
an paid for a new car, there are still some things you need before
you can drive it with confidence-insurance, a steering wheel club,
and perhaps some luxuries that make the driving experience closer
to Fahrvergn\&uuml;gen than FAQ!


<a name="trouble"></a>
<h3>Troubleshooting Difficult Deliveries</h3>

<p>Not every Slackware installation is born on cue to expecting system
administrators. I've pulled a few all nighters, sitting down after
work one evening to upgrade a Slackware box and still there struggling
to get the damn thing back online at dawn, before people start
bitching about their missing mail and news. This section will
look at a few common Slackware setup problems, solutions, and
where to look for additional assistance.


<h3>Slackware Installation FAQs</h3>

<p>Patrick Volkerding, the father of Slackware, has dealt with the
many questions of new users by listening, answering, and anticipating
repeat queries. To catch the new Slackware users before they ask
the same question for the 5,000th time, Patrick has kindly created
documentation and included it with the Slackware distribution.
Three files that you may find very helpful in answering your initial
questions are FAQ.TXT, INSTALL.TXT, and BOOTING.TXT.



<p>Web Support For Slackware

<p>At this time, the Slackware-specific help you'll find on the Internet
tends to be highly customized---such as how to NFS-mount the distribution
on computers within a certain university or how to wire your dorm
room into a particular residential WAN using Slackware.



<p>Usenet Groups For Slackware

<p>The comp.os.linux.* hierarchy of the Usenet is a
treasure-trove of Linux information, not necessarily Slackware-specific.
At present, 11 separate Linux forums handle a high volume of discussion
in this hierarchy. Dozens of other general-Unix newsgroups are
also available. Some discussions relevant to getting Slackware
up and running are:

<ul>
<li>comp.os.linux.setup
<p>A group established for figuring out Linux installation and system
administration. The best place to look for clever setup strategies
and to network with others who may have recently installed Slackware.

<li>comp.os.linux.announce
<p>A must-read for Linux administrators and enthusiasts, C.o.l.a
is a sort of daily Linux digest for the Internet community. The
group is moderated, so only the relevant material makes it into
circulation. The newsgroup is designed as a low-traffic alert
service for announcing Linux-specific software, documentation,
and security warnings.

<li>comp.os.linux.answers
<p>Here's where to find (or post) the latest Linux FAQs, How-Tos,
READMEs and other documents that answer questions about Linux.
</ul>

<p>Mail Lists For Slackware

<p>At this time, there are no electronic mail discussions devoted
to Slackware per-se. You can participate in some excellent Linux-related
talk via e-mail, try www.linux.org and asking in the newsgroups
for a few good subscription lists.



<h3>You Get What You Pay For (Commercial Support)</h3>

<p>Commercial support for Linux is available from some of the CD-ROM
vendors and a long list of Linux Consultants, who can be contacted
through the Linux Commercial and Consultants HOWTO documents:

<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Consultants-HOWTO.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Consultatns-HOWTO.html</a><br>

<a name="basking"></a>
<h3>Basking In the Afterglow</h3>

<p>Don't rest on your laurels quite yet. Especially if your Slackware
machine is a shared computer or lives in a networked environment.
Grooming a computer for community and network  use is a bit more
demanding than just running the setup program and
forgetting about it. We'll leave you with a few pointers to securing
and sharing your new Slackware system.



<h3>Consider Reinstalling!</h3>

<p>I know you just sat through what may have been a long and perplexing
installation session. But before you move into the house you just
built, consider tearing it down and starting over again. Friedrich
Nietzsche had a quote:

"A man learns what he needs to know about building his house only
after he's finished."

<p>If, in the process of installing the system, you had some thoughts
about how you might do it differently, now is the time. If your
Slackware Linux box will be a multi user machine or a network
server, there may never be such a convenient opportunity to reinstall
or reconfigure the system in radical ways.


<a name="install"></a>
<h3>Install And Test Key Applications</h3>

<p>Before you put away the CDROM or return the 50 floppy disks you
borrowed to run the Slackware installation, sit down and test
each application that your users may expect to find in working
order. If professor Bien absolutely has to have emacs humming
under X-Windows, you'd better test it out now, while you've still
got the workstation 'in the shop.'

<p>Did you set up this Linux box to serve a specific purpose in your
organization, such as...

<ul>
<li><b>File and Print Server for Macintoshes or Windows PCs:</b>
Better make sure netatalk, CAP and samba are configured and tested
<li><b>World Wide Web Server:</b>
Time to choose a www daemon and get it up and running
<li><b>Mail Server:</b>
Have you configured sendmail? How alternative
mail applications that offer improved performance, features, or
security over their Slackware-default counterparts? Most mail
servers would benefit from cucipop, procmail,
and Smarlist, to name a few.
<li><b>Remote Access Server:</b>
Got those serial ports or add-in boards working?
<li><b>Firewall:</b>
You might like to look at the second firewall toolkit from
TIS, as well as front-ends to ease firewall and network administration,
such as linuxconf.
</ul>

<a name="secure"></a>
<h3>Secure the System</h3>

<p><b>Get Off The LAN At Once</b>

<p>Out of the box, Slackware is an insecure system. Although Patrick
does his best to create a secure distribution, a few inevitable
holes become known, and patches or workarounds are made available
in the system administration (and cracker) communities. If you
installed Slackware from a network source such as an NFS-mounted
drive, you should temporarily disconnect your box from the LAN
after a successful installation, while you plug a few holes.



<p><b>Give Root a Password</b>  

<p>By default, a new Slackware box will not require a password for
the root user. When you're comfortable that your
new Slackware system is stable (after a few hours, not days or
weeks), add a password to protect the root account.
Login as root and type:

<tt>passwd root</tt>


<p><b>Give Yourself An Account</b>

<p>On large shared systems, the super-user root account is not used as a
working login account by any individual. If you're interested in
system administration or are running a networked machine, this is a
good precedent to follow. Use the \texttt{/sbin/adduser} program to
make yourself a login account, rather than working out of the root
login. I always smile when I see students and hobbyists posting
proudly to the Usenet as root@mymachine.mydomain.  Be humble and safe,
create another login account for your daily work and use su (rather
than login) to enter the root account sparingly.



<p><b>Deny Root Logins</b>

<p>Not only is it uncommon to <I>work</I> as the root user,
it is <I>not considered secure to login as root across the network</I>.
Administrative users usually connect to a Unix box as their regular
username login, and then use the su utility to become
the root user as needed. To prevent crackers, hackers, and ignorant
users from logging in directly as root, edit the file <tt>/etc/securetty</tt>
and comment out (prepend a pound \# sign before) all but the local
terminals:

<tt>console

tty1
tty2
\# ttyS0
\# ttyS1
</tt>

<p>After this fix, users who attempt to login in as root across
the network will be denied:

<tt>Linux 2.0.29 (durak.interactivate.com)<br> 
durak login: root<br> 
root login refused on this terminal.<br> 
durak login:</tt>


<p><b>Apply the Simple Fixes</b>

<p>Slackware installs itself with some very real security problems.
Rather than master Unix security and sleuth out these vulnerabilities
yourself, you can jump start the hole-patching process by visiting
a web resource maintained for just this purpose, called <I>Slackware
SimpleFixes</I>:

<a href="http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux-web/simplefixes/simplefixes.html">http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux-web/simplefixes/simplefixes.html</a><br>


<p><b>Check For Patches On ftp.cdrom.com</b>

<p>As an actively maintained Linux distribution Slackware updates
and patches are available from:

<a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware/patches/">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware/patches/</a><br> 


<p><b>Stay Current</b>

<p>You might like to subscribe to one or more electronic mail lists
that alert users to issues in Linux administration, such as:

<ul>
<li>linux-alert-request@tarsier.cv.nrao.edu

<H2>Linux Installation Project</H2>

</center>
<P> <HR> <P> 

      <h1>Linux Installation Project</h1>

      <p>
	It all started with a simple question: `Why don't we install
	Linux at all our meetings instead of at only some of them?'
	The <a href="http://www.ntlug.org/">North Texas Linux Users
	Group</a> had been in existence for only about five months,
	and we wanted to make sure to spread the word in North Texas
	about Linux. We wanted to educate the computing public in our
	area about Linux, but we also wanted to let experienced
	computer users know that Linux could handle anything they
	threw at it.

      <p>
	After meeting at Texas Christian University for our first few
	meetings, we signed a contract with the <a
	href="http://www.dfwxchange.com/dfwx.nsf/?Open">DFWXchange</a> that enabled NTLUG
	to meet at the <a href="http://www.infomartusa.com">Dallas
	Infomart</a>. The DFWXchange is an umbrella organization that
	allows Dallas-Fort Worth users groups to meet at the Infomart
	for free, with all costs being absorbed by the many commercial
	vendors who also meet at the Infomart during the Super Satuday
	Sale. So every month between 3,000 and 5,000 computer users
	from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex converge on the
	Infomart---the premier meeting facility in the Southwest
	devoted exclusively to computer and technology events and
	organziations---to participate in users groups meetings and to
	take advantage of some really good prices on computer-related
	hardware. It's a big party.

      <p>
	It didn't take long for the NTLUG leadership to realize that
	we had stumbled upon a great opportunity: we wanted to let
	computer users in our area know about Linux, and we were now
	meeting every month in a facility filled with thousands of
	potential Linux converts. Our solution was to start the
	<b>Linux Installation Project</b>, which we call the
	<b>LIP</b>.

      <p>
	The goal of <b>LIP</b> is simply to install Linux on as many
	computers as possible. Those of us who participate in this
	project month-to-month have discovered that the very best way
	to advocate the use of Linux is to make it easy and painless
	for the unconverted to do just that: namely, run Linux on
	their computer of choice. In other words, Linux is its own
	best advocate. After a few weeks without a crash, most people
	say goodbye to Windows 95 with zealous enthusiasm.  We like to
	think of <b>LIP</b> as an ongoing Linux Installation Festival
	that allows us to convert computer users to Linux one at a
	time.

      <p>
	The first step in establishing <b>LIP</b> as a well-run,
	consistent endeavor was to find someone to lead the
	effort. NTLUG is fortunate to have a technologically advanced
	membership, and it was fairly easy to find someone to lead the
	<b>LIP</b>; in fact, we found two such people: Mike Dunn and
	Bill Petersen, both of whom are experienced Unix and Linux
	Sysadmins. Under their guidance, and due to the generosity of
	NTLUG members, NTLUG's <b>LIP</b> has solicited and organized
	enough computer hardware to perform up to many simultaneous
	installations of Linux by all the usual methods, although
	we've found that cdrom installations are usually the most
	trouble free.

      <p>
	The word has now spread in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth
	Metroplex---from schools and universities to computer vendors
	and other users groups---that NTLUG's <b>LIP</b> is the place
	to go for a painless installation of Linux onto PCs, laptops,
	servers, and even Alpha platforms. We have expanded our
	efforts at the <b>LIP</b> booth to include Linux advocacy,
	advertisement for Linux vendors who supply us with materials,
	the sale of Linux CDs (thanks to Bradley Glonka at <a
	href="http://www.lsl.com/">Linux Systems Labs</a>), and even
	basic Linux system administration and maintenance. We also
	spend a lot of time explaining to the uninitiated masses what
	makes Linux <b><i>free</i></b> and what makes it so much fun.

      <p>
	While we have been happy with the results so far, the
	<b>LIP</b> has more work to do. We want to expand our sales
	efforts to include other kinds of Linux merchandise (the sales
	of which go to support NTLUG and <b>LIP</b>), and we'd also
	like to expand our hardware assets to enable more simultaneous
	installations. Finally, we also want to develop our users
	group assets to such an extent that we can go to other
	DFW-area computer events and setup Linux installation and
	advocacy booths. NTLUG's approach to the Linux Installation
	Project can be summed up in the phrase: "Linux is free. Life
	is good."

      <p>
	If you want to learn more about the North Texas Linux Users
	Group or our Linux Installation Project, or if you're a Linux
	Users Group and would like to talk about setting up your own
	local version of <b>LIP</b>, please visit the <a
	href="http://www.ntlug.org/">NTLUG</a> website or contact me
	at <i><a
	href="mailto:kclark@computek.net">kclark@computek.net</a></i>.
	
      <p>
	Finally, I would be guilty of ingratitude if I did not thank
	the following people and organizations that have made the
	<b>LIP</b> possible. Please forgive me if I've forgotten
	anyone. It's just about impossible not to meet great people
	when you work with Linux.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Sean Dreilinger</H4>
Sean Dreilinger 
suffered through two years of Los Angeles smog for a Masters degree in
library/information systems at UCLA. Linux swept him off his feet in grad
school and turned into a Network Administration career for the University.
Consulting on Internet strategy and info-system design in assorted
bored-rooms followed. Today he beams-in to www.interactivate.com from a
remote mountain cabin near Cuyamaca, California and is only required to
show his face at work once a week--nice job for the outdoors-loving and
socially inept. He lives with his lover Kathy and this incredible
high-altitude silence--punctuated only by the sound of wind rustling in the
Manzanita trees, hummingbirds fighting for a perch on the feeder, and that
reassuring whir of SCSI drives dancing with Linux under the desk. More life
story with explicit photos can be found at http://www.interactivate.com/people/sean/.

proud of his &quot;child,&quot; The Dotfile Generator, which he wrote as part of his
job at the university. The idea for it came a year and a half ago, when he had
to learn how to configure Emacs by reading about 700 pages of the lisp manual.
It started small, but as time went by, it expanded into a huge project.
In his spare time, he does Yiu-Yitsu, listens to music, drinks beer and has fun with
his girl friend. He loves pets, and has a 200 litre aquarium and two very cute
rabbits.

Seattle--always a wonderful event. Riley and I spent the morning working
in the yard, clearing out a flower bed that was overgrown with grass. It
felt like hard physical labor after sitting at a desk all week. We rewarded
ourselves by taking a spin on the motorcycle along the Sound. Even as
passenger there is something about riding on a motorcycle that puts a smile
on my face. I guess it helps that I have complete trust in Riley's driving
abilities.
<P> 
Afterward I went to the Opera House for a talk about <I>Il Trovatore</I> by
Giuseppe Verdi (or Joe Green, as Riley likes to call him). I had seen
the opera itself on Wednesday night--a silly
story as usual but, oh, such
wonderful music! I think it has to be one of my favorites. At any rate
the talk was informative and fun and made a nice end to a very wonderful
day.
<P>
Have fun!
