MIME type name: application

MIME subtype name: news-transmission

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:  CONVERSIONS, as for application/octet-stream

Encoding considerations:
	Use of MIME base64 encoding is strongly encouraged to
	ensure intact transmission.

Security considerations:
	News articles may constitute "control messages", which can
	have effects on a host's news system beyond just addition
	of information.  Since control messages may occur in normal
	news flow, most hosts are suitably defended against undesired
	effects already.

Published specification: RFC 1036

Comments:
	The intent here is to define a standard way of transmitting
	news articles or batches via mail, in situations where this is
	the transmission route of last resort for ongoing news feeds.
	Numerous ad-hoc ways of doing this are already in use, most of
	them inferior to  use of MIME for the purpose.
