MIME type name: message

MIME subtype name: news

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: same as message/rfc822

Security considerations:
	News articles may constitute "control messages", which can
	have effects on a host's news system beyond just addition
	of information.  Since control messages may occur in normal
	news flow, most hosts are suitably defended against undesired
	effects already, but transmission of news articles via mail
	may bypass firewall-type defenses.  Reading a news article
	transmitted by mail involves no hazards beyond those of mail,
	but submitting it to news software for processing should be
	done with care.

Published specification: RFC 1036

Comments:
	The intent here is to define a standard way of transmitting
	news articles via mail for human reading.  Message/rfc822 is
	not sufficient because the headers of news articles have
	semantics beyond those defined by RFC 822.
