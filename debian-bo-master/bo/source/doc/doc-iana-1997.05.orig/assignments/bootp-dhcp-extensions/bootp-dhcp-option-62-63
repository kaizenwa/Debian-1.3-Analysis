Joyce,

This is the little paragraphs like in RFC 1533 for each of my 
requests.

Thank you for your help.

1. The NetWare/IP Domain Name

This option code is used to convey the NetWare/IP domain name used by the
NetWare/IP product.

The code for this option is 62, and its maximum length is 255.

       code  Len    NetWare/IP Domain Name
     +-----+-----+------+------+------+-----
     |  62 |  n  |  c1  |  c2  |  c3  |  ...
     +-----+-----+------+------+------+-----

2. The General Purposed NetWare/IP Information

The NetWare/IP general purposed option code will be used to convey all the
NetWare/IP related information except for the NetWare/IP domain name.

A number of NetWare/IP sub-options will be conveyed using this option code.

The code for this option is 63, and its maximum length is 255.

       code  Len    NetWare/IP General Info
     +-----+-----+------+------+------+-----
     |  63 |  n  |  c1  |  c2  |  c3  |  ...
     +-----+-----+------+------+------+-----

NetWare/IP domain looks like a typical DNS domain in terms of its syntax.
However, the usage and application of NetWare/IP is very different than 
that of DNS domain. NetWare/IP servers and clients reply on a pre-configured
NetWare/IP domain name to associate themselves with each other which
consistitues a virtual IPX network. So, a workstation can have a DNS domain
name -- cs.berkeley.edu, but its NetWare/IP domain name could be nwip.ucla.edu.

Yes, It is to be a collection "sub-options". And there will be a 
<code, length, data> structure in the sub-option string.

The following are the currently defined sub-options:


 NWIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST
 NWIP_EXIST_IN_VENDER_AREA
 NWIP_EXIST_IN_SNAME_FILE
 NWIP_EXIST_BUT_TOO_BIG
 NSQ_BROADCAST
 PREFERRED_DSS
 NEAREST_NWIP_SERVER
 AUTORETRIES
 AUTORETRY_SECS
 NWIP_1_1
