Subject: Request to modify definition of BOOTP/DHCP option #77

Hi,

I would like to modify the definition of BOOTP/DHCP option code #77,
"User Class Information", submitted by me in earlier correspondence.
The option description change is a result of discussions within the IETF
DHCP Working Group and is recommended by its chairperson, Ralph Droms.

Thanks and regards,

User Class Information

  This option is used by a DHCP client to optionally identify the type
  or category of user or application it represents.  The format of
  this option is an NVT ASCII text object of varying length which
  represents a user class of which the client host is a member.

  DHCP administrators may define specific user class identifiers to
  convey information about a host's software configuration or about
  its user's preferences.  For example, an identifier may specify
  that a particular DHCP client is a member of the class "accounting
  auditors", which have special service needs such as a particular
  database server.

  Servers not equipped to interpret the user class specified by
  a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).  Otherwise,
  servers SHOULD respond with the set of options corresponding to all
  user classes which it is equipped to handle.  Further, if the
  server responds, it MUST return this option and value as specified
  by the requesting host.

  The code for this option is 77.  The minimum length for this
  option is two.
