Dear IANA,


Here is the information you requested:

    Client FQDN Option (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
    
       To update the IP address to FQDN mapping a DHCP server needs to know
       FQDN of the client to which the server leases the address. To allow
       the client to convey its FQDN to the server this document defines a
       new option, called "Client FQDN".
    
       The code for this option is TBD. Its minimum length is 4.
    
    
    
             Code   Len    Flags  RCODE1 RCODE2   Domain Name
            +------+------+------+------+------+------+--
            |  81  |   n  |  0/1 |      |      |       ...
            +------+------+------+------+------+------+--
    
    
    
       The Flags field allows a DHCP client to indicate to a DHCP server
       whether the client wants the server to be responsible for updating
       the FQDN to IP address mapping (if Flags is set to 1), or whether the
       client wants to take this responsibility (if Flags is set to 0).
    
       The RCODE1 and RCODE2 fields are used by a DHCP server to indicate to
       a DHCP client the Response Code from Dynamic DNS Updates.
    
       The Domain Name part of the option carries FQDN of a client.
    
More details on the use of this option are in draft-ietf-dhc-dhcp-dns-02.txt.

Yakov.
