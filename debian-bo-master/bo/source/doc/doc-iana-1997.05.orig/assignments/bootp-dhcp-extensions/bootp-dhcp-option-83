X.X Agent Remote ID

This option MAY be added by DHCP relay agents which terminate switched
or permanent circuits and have mechanisms to identify the remote host
end of the circuit.  The Remote ID field may be used to encode, for
instance:

    -- a "caller ID" telephone number for dial-up connection
    -- a "user name" prompted for by a Remote Access Server
    -- a remote caller ATM address
    -- a "modem ID" of a cable data modem
    -- the remote IP address of a point-to-point link
    -- a remote X.25 address for X.25 connections

The format of the Agent Remote ID will depend on the type of circuit
connected to the relay agent, and further specification of this field
may be standardized by the IETF working groups responsible for IP
communications on those circuit types.  The only requirement is that
the remote ID be administered as globally unique.

DHCP servers supporting this option MUST return the option value
unchanged in all Offer and Ack responses.  DHCP servers MAY use this
option to select parameters specific to particular users, hosts, or
subscriber modems.  The relay agent MAY use this field in addition to
or instead of the Agent Circuit ID field to select the circuit on
which to forward the DHCP Offer/Ack reply.
