I would like to register two new DHCP options:

1. Server name

This option is used to identify a boot server when the 'sname'
field in the DHCP header has been used for DHCP options.

The code for this option is x, and its minimum length is 1.

    Code  Len   TFTP server
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  x  |  n  |  c1 |  c2 |  c3 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---

2. Bootfile name

This option is used to identify a bootfile when the 'file'
field in the DHCP header has been used for DHCP options.

The code for this option is y, and its minimum length is 1.

    Code  Len   Bootfile name
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---
   |  y  |  n  |  c1 |  c2 |  c3 | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---


Thanks...
