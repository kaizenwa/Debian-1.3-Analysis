Subject: Request for DHCP Options for Circuit-Mode Relay Agents

X.X Agent Subnet Mask

This option MAY be added by DHCP relay agents which terminate multiple
circuits that are configured with a subnet mask for that circuit.  It
provides the server with the subnet mask for the circuit on which the
relay agent received the request.

DHCP servers supporting this option MAY copy the Agent Subnet mask
value into the Client Subnet Mask (option 1) parameter returned to the
host, and SHOULD have a configurable option to do so.  DHCP Servers
SHOULD NOT return the Agent Subnet Mask option in the response.

This option is intended to avoid the duplicate configuration in both
the relay agent and the server of the agent's circuit subnet masks.  A
DHCP relay agent terminating a public data switched network may have
thousands of such configured circuits and masks.
