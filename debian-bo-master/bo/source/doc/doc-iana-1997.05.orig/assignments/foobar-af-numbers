FOOBAR AF NUMBERS


In the FTP Operation Over Big Address Records (FOOBAR) Protocol
[RFC1639] there is a field, called "address family" or "af", to
identify the lower level protocol addresses in use.  This is an 8 bit
field.  The first 16 assignments (0-15) of the af value are exactly
the same as the IP Version number.  The assignment for values 16-255
are listed here.
