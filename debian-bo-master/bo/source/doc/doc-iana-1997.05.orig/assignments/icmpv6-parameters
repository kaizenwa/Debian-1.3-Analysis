ICMP TYPE NUMBERS

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) has many messages that
are identified by a "type" field [RFC1885].

Type	Name					Reference
----	-------------------------		---------
   1    Destination Unreachable                 [RFC1885]
   2    Packet Too Big                          [RFC1885]
   3    Time Exceeded                           [RFC1885]
   4    Parameter Problem                       [RFC1885]

 128     Echo Request                           [RFC1885]
 129     Echo Reply                             [RFC1885]
 130     Group Membership Query                 [RFC1885]
 131     Group Membership Report                [RFC1885]
 132     Group Membership Reduction             [RFC1885]



Many of these ICMP types have a "code" field.  Here we list the types
again with their assigned code fields.
