MOBILE IP NUMBERS

The document "IP Mobility Support" [RFC 2002] specifies some message
types and extensibility fields.

Message Format and Protocol Extensibility

   Mobile IP defines a set of new control messages, sent with UDP [17]
   using well-known port number 434.  Currently, the following two
   message types are defined:

      1  Registration Request
      3  Registration Reply

   Mobile IP defines a general Extension mechanism to allow optional
   information to be carried by Mobile IP control messages or by ICMP
   Router Discovery messages.  Each of these Extensions (with one
   exception) is encoded in the following Type-Length-Value format:

    0                   1                   2
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
   |     Type      |    Length     |    Data ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

      Type     Indicates the particular type of Extension.

      Length   Indicates the length (in bytes) of the data field within
               this Extension.  The length does NOT include the Type and
               Length bytes.

      Data     The particular data associated with this Extension.  This
               field may be zero or more bytes in length.  The format
               and length of the data field is determined by the type
               and length fields.

   Extensions allow variable amounts of information to be carried within
   each datagram.  The end of the list of Extensions is indicated by the
   total length of the IP datagram.

   Two separately maintained sets of numbering spaces, from which
   Extension Type values are allocated, are used in Mobile IP:

    -  The first set consists of those Extensions which may appear only
       in Mobile IP control messages (those sent to and from UDP port
       number 434).  Currently, the following Types are defined for
       Extensions appearing in Mobile IP control messages:

          32  Mobile-Home Authentication
          33  Mobile-Foreign Authentication
          34  Foreign-Home Authentication

    -  The second set consists of those extensions which may appear only
       in ICMP Router Discovery messages [4].  Currently, Mobile IP
       defines the following Types for Extensions appearing in ICMP
       Router Discovery messages:

           0  One-byte Padding (encoded with no Length nor Data field)
          16  Mobility Agent Advertisement
          19  Prefix-Lengths

   Due to the separation (orthogonality) of these sets, it is
   conceivable that two Extensions that are defined at a later date
   could have identical Type values, so long as one of the Extensions
   may be used only in Mobile IP control messages and the other may be
   used only in ICMP Router Discovery messages.

   When an Extension numbered in either of these sets within the range 0
   through 127 is encountered but not recognized, the message containing
   that Extension MUST be silently discarded.  When an Extension
   numbered in the range 128 through 255 is encountered which is not
   recognized, that particular Extension is ignored, but the rest of
   the Extensions and message data MUST still be processed.  The Length
   field of the Extension is used to skip the Data field in searching
   for the next Extension.

One-byte Padding Extension

   Some IP protocol implementations insist upon padding ICMP messages
   to an even number of bytes.  If the ICMP length of an Agent
   Advertisement is odd, this Extension MAY be included in order to make
   the ICMP length even.  Note that this Extension is NOT intended to
   be a general-purpose Extension to be included in order to word- or
   long-align the various fields of the Agent Advertisement.  An Agent
   Advertisement SHOULD NOT include more than one One-byte Padding
   Extension and if present, this Extension SHOULD be the last Extension
   in the Agent Advertisement.

   Note that unlike other Extensions used in Mobile IP, the One-byte
   Padding Extension is encoded as a single byte, with no "Length" nor
   "Data" field present.  The One-byte Padding Extension is defined as
   follows:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Type 0 (One-byte Padding Extension)


Code Field
