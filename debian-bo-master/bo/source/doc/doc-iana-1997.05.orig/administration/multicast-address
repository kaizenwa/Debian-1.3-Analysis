We need some documentation on your proposed use of a multicast address.

This can be in the form of a one to two page description, article, or
manual.  

We are looking for a technical description of how your use of a
multicast interacts with the Internet Protocol architecture.

We need at least the following information, which is for our internal
use, only.

1)  What is the protocol on the network?

2)  What message formats, types, op codes, sequences are used?

3)  What functions are performed by this protocol?

4)  How is multicast used in this application?

We require a enough detail to understand how your application uses the
network.  At a minimum this will be a full page of text.  Once we have
the above information in hand, and understand it, we can assign a
multicast address.

Most systems that use multicast don't actually need a specifically
assigned multicast address.  Rather they can use the "sd" tool (or a
similar tool) to announce their multicast session and dynamically
allocate multicast addresses as needed from the designated pool.

We are willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement if your product is
considered "proprietary".  Processing the non-disclosure agreement
will take much longer (a month or more) than making the actual
assignment (a week or less).

Please return the completed application to "iana@isi.edu".
