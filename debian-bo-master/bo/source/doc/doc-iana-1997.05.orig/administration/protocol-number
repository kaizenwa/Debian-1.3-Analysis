We need some documentation on your proposed use of a protocol number.

This can be in the form of a one to two page description, article, or
manual.  

We are looking for a technical description of how your application
interacts with the Internet Protocol.

We need at least the following information, which is for our internal
use, only.

1)  What is the protocol that is transmitted over the network?

2)  What message formats, types, op codes, sequences are used?

3)  What functions are performed by this protocol?

4)  Is broadcast or multicast used?  If so, how and what for?

We require a enough detail to understand how your application uses the
network.  At a minimum this will be a full page of text.  Once we have
the above information in hand, and understand it, we can assign a
protocol number.

We are willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement if your product is
considered "proprietary".  Processing the non-disclosure agreement
will take much longer (a month or more) than making the actual
assignment (a week or less).

Please return the completed application to "iana@isi.edu".
