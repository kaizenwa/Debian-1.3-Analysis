Hi.

You should get your IP address (a 32bit number) from your network
service provider.

If for some reason that does not work, you can contact the Internic at
<hostmaster@internic.net>.

Please do contact your network service provider first, though.  The
Internic will want to know all the gory details about why that didn't
work out before they allocate you an address directly.
