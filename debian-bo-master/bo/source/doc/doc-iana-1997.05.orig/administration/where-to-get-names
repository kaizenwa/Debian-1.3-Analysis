Hi.

To get a domain name please contact your network service provider.

Network names (domain names like foo.com) are assigned by the Internic
registration service.  The Internic works with your network service
provider to do this.  If you really must contact the Internic the
address is  <hostmaster@internic.net>.

This is for names in the top-level domains COM, NET, ORG, EDU, GOV,
and MIL. (Note that EDU is limited to 4-year colleges and
universities, GOV is restricted to US federal government agencies, and
MIL is restricted to US federal government military entities.

For name in a particular country (for example .FR for France) you must
contact the administrator for that country.

For names in the United States (.US) domain, please read RFC 1480 and
then contact the administrator at <us-domain@isi.edu>.

However it is usually most efficient to work with your network service
provider to get a registered network name, since the service provider
has done it all before and can fill out the necessary forms correctly
the first time.
