dwww (1.4.1-1) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed major security flaw: dwww.cgi would accept backquotes
    and '$' characters, then pass them on to bash.  This enables
    people to execute commands as the CGI user.  Particularily
    dangerous if someone configures their web server to run
    CGI programs as root. dwww.cgi was modified to convert all
    backquotes and dollar signs into underscores.
  * dwww.cgi: don't convert '+' characters into spaces - fixes
    bug #8563 (Thanks Lars Wirzenius and Joost Witteveen)
  * dwwwconfig: place quotes around DWWW_SERVERTYPE in 
    /etc/dwww/dwww.conf to cope with server names with space
    such as CERN httpd - fixes bug #8525
  * /etc/cron.daily/dwww: added line to cd to /var/spool/dwww
    to prevent error message that someone was having (not me)
    - fixed bug #8591

dwww (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added emacs lines to changelog
  * dwww-convert: accepts HTML files that end in .htm  - previously 
    only .html was supported) 
    (Thanks to Susan G. Kleinmann)
  * dwww-convert: properly handles files that do not exist
  * dwww-convert: checks for a .html.gz file if a .html file does 
    not exist, and vice-versa  
    (Thanks to Brian C. White)
  * dwww-convert: modified perl code in script to do replacements
    over the entire HTML file instead of doing it line by line
  * added full path to dwww-cache in /etc/cron.daily/dwww
    (Thanks to Herbert Xu for reporting the bug, and Henrik
    Wallin for the fix) - fixes bug #7088
  * made fixes to dwww-find and dwww-doc-index to make dwww work
    with bash 2.0 - fixes bugs #7103, #7143 and #7156
    (Thanks to Szymon M. Rusinkiewicz and Joey Hess)
  * dwww-convert: fixed small bug which confused newlines with
    contents of href tags
  * dwww-convert: recognize when filename is a directories.  It it
    is, then check for index.htm* files, and display them as 
    standard files if found.  Removed code from
    builtin_dir2html() that would display index.htm* files.
  * dwww-convert: optimized builtin_dir2html() by using new
    feature of accessing directories using 'file' type.  Removed
    sed scripts.  Massive performance boost.  :-)
  * dwww-convert: fixed builtin_dir2html() to do file links to
    all types of *.htm* files when using DWWW_USEFILEURL
  * dwww-convert: added code to check for .htm, .html, .htm.gz,
    and .html.gz files when file not found.  Also, strip off
    HTML anchors.
  * Makefile, debian/rules: reworked directories, added 
    /var/lib/dwww/html.  Changed documentation files to be mode
    0644.  Removed sticky bit from /var/spool/dwww directory and
    removed /var/spool/dwww/.cache_db file.
  * dwww-doc-index: changed function names to be compatible with
    sh and bash - fixes bug #7267
    (Thanks Bill Wohler)
  * adminlinks.htm, docintro.html, search-docs.html: removed these
    incomplete .html files to ./lib/editorial directory
  * dwww-build, dwww.template: Make more lynx friendly -- build man 
    page indexes in separate directories.  Put search engine first.  
    Remove link to docintro.html (it's incomplete).  Add link to
    menu.html.
  * dwww, dwww-build, dwww.1, dwww.8, postinst:  Change location of
    main index page from http://localhost/dwww/dwww.html to 
    http://localhost/dwww/index.html.
  * dwww-build, html templates: modified so that there are new
    indexes to the man pages, and they are in separate directories
    (much like how Yahoo is set up).
  * dwww-build, dwww.8: Make title configurable.
  * Added Joost Witteveen's Debian Documentation Menu (Thanks!).
  * change location for /etc/dwww.conf to /etc/dwww/dwww.conf
  * control: added Recommends: menu (>= 0.11)
  * dwwwconfig, Makefile, rules: moved dwwwconfig from debian
    directory in source to main directory
  * added /var/www/dwww and /usr/lib/cgi-bin/dwww symlinks - to
    conform to web standard
  * removed INSTALL.Debian file and removed many items from to do
    list
  * dwww-build: modified it to create index files for wn web server

dwww (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed references to localhost in dwww.template
  * Replaced references to file://localhost with
    reference to '/cgi-bin/dwww?type=file\&location=/usr/doc'
  * modified dwww-doc-index so that it doesn't complain if
    /usr/local/doc doesn't exist
  * added Perl code to dwww-convert to make links in html
    files point to cgi-script
  * added MIME headers to dwww-convert and removed them
    from cgi-script
  * added DWWW_SERVERNAME, DWWW_CGIUSER, and DWWW_USEFILEURL
    options to /etc/dwww.conf.  Modified dwww.8 man page.
  * modified dwww script, and dwww-convert script to use
    DWWW_SERVERNAME instead of localhost
  * if DWWW_USEFILEURL is set, revert back to old behaviour
    of using file:// URL's for performance

    DWWW_CGIUSER when calling dwww-cache --clean

dwww (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debian/* into upstream source. This changelog now works for
    upstream source as well.
  * Moved dwwwconfig into debian/dwwwconfig.
  * Added /usr/local/doc and /usr/share/doc into dwww front page.
  * Fixed dwww-cache's --list and --list-all show that they don't show
    out-of-date documents.
  * Changed "Package specific directories" into a normal "dir" request
    to dwww.cgi. This makes new packages immediately visible.
  * Removed "Copyrights" and "Examples" from front page. They're now
    inside package specific directories.
  * Added a C program to convert text to HTML. Much faster than the old
    sed jungle, and works better, too. Does manual pages too. However,
    doesn't remove headers and footers yet (and the old shell script
    code was buggy, so I removed it).
  * Removed package specific directory listing and copyrights from
    front page (and dwww-build). The latter is no longer needed, the
    former is better done with dir2html and caching.
  * Removed support for Info files (use info2www instead, since it
    actually works).
  * Removed support for compressed files in the cache. It slowed things
    too much, and wasn't all that useful, unless you were _really_
    short on disk space.
  * Fixed bug in dwww-quickfind: now searching for "sh" doesn't find
    tkdesksh (for example), but always finds something that ends in
    /sh, i.e., /bin/sh. Still a problem if there is both a /bin/sh
    and a /usr/bin/sh.
  * dwww-quickfind: Reads output of "dpkg --search '*'" instead of
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list. This gives more portability, but makes
    dwww-daily somewhat slower. Only looks at files that contain
    /bin/, /sbin/, /usr/games/, for speed reasons.
  * dwww-cache: strip unnecessary .html end from files in /var/spool/dwww.
  * Added dwww-format-man: batch format manual pages into the cache.
  * Added dependency on man, for obvious reasons.
  * Added lists of documents (dwww-doc-linux).
  * Added GPL as file COPYING.
  * Fixed man-sections.html.
  * dwww-cache: Added prefix compression.
  * dwww-build: fixed suffix removal from name (in.telnetd.8 used to
    result in "in", now in "in.telnetd")
  * dwww-build: doesn't find non-English manual pages (because they
    make lists confusing; a future version will create separate lists
    for each language)
