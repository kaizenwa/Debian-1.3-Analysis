<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Larry Ayers</H4>
Larry Ayers lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">James T. Dennis</H4>
Jim Dennis 
is the proprietor of <A href="http://www.starshine.org">
Starshine Technical Services</A>.
His professional experience includes work in the technical 
support, quality assurance, and information services (MIS)
departments of software companies like 
<A href="http://www.quarterdeck.com"> Quarterdeck</A>, 
<A href="http://www.symantec.com"> Symantec/
Peter Norton Group</A>, and 
<A href="http://www.mcafee.com"> McAfee Associates</A> -- as well as 
positions (field service rep) with smaller VAR's.
He's been using Linux since version 0.99p10 and is an active
participant on an ever-changing list of mailing lists and 
newsgroups.  He's just started collaborating on the 2nd Edition
for a book on Unix systems administration.
Jim is an avid science fiction fan -- and recently got
married at the World Science Fiction Convention in Anaheim.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Bill Duncan</H4>
Bill has worked with Unix systems since the early Version 7 days on PDP-11's.
He worked with Xenix throughout most of the eighties and has also worked
with many other flavors of Unix over the years, but his operating system
of choice is now Linux.  When not working or fiddling with his four Linux
systems at home (which is rare), he might have some time left over for his
other hobbies; his dog (Daisy), photography and Amateur Radio.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Michael J. Hammel</H4>
Michael J. Hammel,
is a transient software engineer with a background in
everything from data communications to GUI development to Interactive Cable
systems--all based in Unix. His interests outside of computers
include 5K/10K races, skiing, Thai food and gardening. He suggests if you
have any serious interest in finding out more about him, you visit his home
pages at http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel. You'll find out more
there than you really wanted to know. 

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Oleg Machulski</H4>
Oleg Machulski is a student of
   <A HREF="http://mech.math.msu.su/chislmet.htm"> Laboratory
                                      of Computing methods</A>
   at the
   <A HREF="http://mech.math.msu.su/">Faculty of Mechanics and
Mathematics</A>,
   <A HREF="http://www.msu.ru/">Moscow State University</A>.

He has been a Linux enthusiast since Sept.1996 as well as an OS/2 enthusiast.
After receiving the source of a 
very unusual DOS text editor, where the program was structurized
in a hypertext manner from his scientific advisor Andrey V. Astreling,
he wrote and ported the following functions:
search, macrocommands, multiple pages and so on.
Brief history of that freeware project could be found at
       http://shade.msu.ru/~machulsk/mmm/mmm.html
Also, I like to play guitar and listen to jazz music.
Additional info can be found at my homepage

Hans Paijmans</a></H4>
<P> 
Hans &quot;Paai&quot; Paijmans is University lecturer &
researcher at Tilburg University and a regular contributor to several
Dutch journals. Together with E. Maryniak he wrote the first dutch
book on Linux--already two years ago. My, doesn't the time fly.
His homepage is at http://pi0959.kub.nl:2080/paai.html.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Greg Roelofs</a></H4>
Greg Roelofs, aka Cave Newt,
is best described as a phenomenon, as in, ``Captain, we're picking
up strange readings from that unexplained phenomenon over there.''
Greg's job description is appropriately schizoid, given his interest in far
too many things for his own good.
He's a full-time researcher in multimedia/image-compression/WWW stuff 
at <A HREF="greg_philips.html">Philips Research at 
Palo Alto</A>, having made the switch from Unix system administrator in August
1995. He likes to fancy himself a 
<A HREF="greg_software.html">software developer</A>; among other things, he has
been a member of the <A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/">Info-ZIP</A>
team for six years and the principal author of 
<A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/UnZip.html"><B>UnZip</B></A> for
most of that time. (He's also a member of the <B>Portable Network Graphics</B>
Development Group and the maintainer of the 
<A HREF="http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/PNG/">PNG</A> and 
<A HREF="http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/zlib/">zlib</A> home pages.)
As for recreational interests, he likes to amuse himself by cycling
(often to work); skiing--any flavor, although snow preferred, especially
if it means he can drive in it; scuba diving--for 18 years now, from the 
shores of Lake Superior to the coast of Venezuela to the kelp beds of 
Monterey; and hiking/backpacking, particularly in the Sierra Nevada range;
and <A HREF="greg_photos.html" >amateur photographer</A>.

James Shelburne</a></H4>
<P> 
James Shelburne currently lives in Waco, Texas where he spends most of 
his free time working on various Linux networking projects. Some of his 
interests include Perl + CGI, Russian, herbal medicine and the Ramones 
(yes, you heard right, the Ramones). He is also a staunch Linux advocate 
and tries to convert every MacOS/MS Windows/AMIGA user he comes into 
contact with. Needless to say, only other Linux users can stand him.

<P>
Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.

<img src="../gx/snow.gif" alt="" align=right>
I'd like to apologize for being later than usual getting
<i>LG</i> posted. The weather in Seattle has been a more than a little bizarre
lately. My
neighborhood got about 20 inches of snow from December 26 to December 29.
Since the normal yearly snowfall is about 4 inches, everything stopped,
including the buses for the first time in Metro history. SSC had a portion
of the roof give way under the weight of snow and water (the rains started
December 29 and haven't quit yet). As a result of the flooding, things are
in quite a mess around the office. Yearly rainfall in Seattle is usually 31
inches; this year we had 55 inches. I thought I was back in Houston!
<P> 
Actually, I was back in Houston during my vacation week before Christmas.
The weather wasn't
great there either -- rainy and cold, and I was counting on sunshine. However,
I still had a good time visiting with family and friends. My grandchildren, Sarah
and Rebecca, are a delight to be with -- I miss them a lot. 
<P> 
Have fun!
