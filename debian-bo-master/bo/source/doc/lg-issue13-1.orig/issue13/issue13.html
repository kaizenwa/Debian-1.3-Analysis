<H2>Welcome to Linux Gazette!<img src="../gx/tm.gif" alt="(tm)"></H2>

<P>
<I>Linux Gazette</I>, a member of the Linux Documentation Project, is
an on-line WWW publication that is dedicated to two simple ideas:

<UL>
<LI>Making Linux just a <I>little</I> more fun
<LI>Sharing ideas and discoveries
</UL>

<P>
The basic idea behind these two concepts is that Linux is
one cool OS, whose price for admission is a willingness to read,
learn, tinker (aka, <I>hack!</I>), and then share your experiences. The
Gazette is a compilation of basic tips, tricks,
suggestions, ideas and short articles about Linux designed to
make using Linux fun and easy. <I>LG</I> began as a personal project of John M.
Fisk, and grew to include
contributions freely provided by a growing number of authors. <I>Linux
Journal</I> is now publishing the Gazette using material contributed by outside
authors <a href="authors.html">(note to potential authors)</a>.
Without these authors there would not be a Gazette, and I thank them all.
Drop a note to the author of anything that you find helpful or
instructive--the author's e-mail address is included for this very
purpose. 

<P>
<I>Linux Gazette</I> is a non-commercial publication and will
remain that way. 
A tar, gzip file containing all issues of <I>Linux Gazette</I> and one containing
the current issue can be found at <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg/">ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg/</A> 

<P>
Thanks to <B>Matt Welsh</B>, coordinator of the <B>Linux
Documentation Project</B>, for graciously bringing the <I>Linux Gazette</I>
under the auspices of the LDP. The material included in these documents is 
covered by a designedly liberal copyright.

I liked your comment about quilting being an interest. We tend to forget
that people have interests outside of computers in general (and linux in
particular).
<P> 
Just like to say thanks for what is obviously an enormous effort you are
putting into the gazette. I'm new(ish) to linux and I find it a great
resource, not to say entertaining.
<P> 
Has anyone suggested an article on the use of Xresources? As I said I'm
fairly new and find this a bit confusing... maybe someone would be
interested in an example or three?
<P> 
Oh and with the quilting and geometry ... better make sure its not the
80x25+1-1 variety.
<blockquote> <I> 
(Thanks, LG is a lot of work, as well as a lot of fun. And yes, I do have

Great Resource,

	I really like the resource Linux offers new users. I have already
applied a few tricks to my PC. I wish some one would explain how to use
the GNU C/C++ compiler with Linux. It is a tool resting in my hard
drive. With commercial compilers, there is a programming environment
that links libraries automatically. Are there any tricks to command line
C/C++ programming with Linux?? Stay online!

Hi,
<P> 
I have been so far unsuccessful in finding information for InfraRed 
support on Linux.
<P> 
I am particularly interested in hooking up Caldera Linux on a Thinkpad 560 
using Extended Systems JetEye Net Plus.  Caldera on Thinkpad I can handle 
but the JetEye allows connection to ethernet or token ring networks via IR.
<P> 
My searches of Linux Resources page come up negative.
I have posted to USENET and also emailed any web master that has any mention 
of ThinkPad or IR on their pages. Still no answer.
<P> 
Can you help me to find information.  If I am successful, I would be 
willing to write an article about it.
<P>

<P> 
Hi there,
<P> 
First I have to apologize for writing to this address with my problem, but I
don't no where to search for an answer and university's network is so
damned slow that surfing through the net searching for an answer makes no fun.
Another reason is that I've got no access to Usenet... means can't post in 
comp.os.linux.networking... 8-((
<P> 
I tried to find a news server near to Germany which allows posting without 
using that damned -> identd <- but found none, may be you know where to find 
a list with (free) news servers ?
<P> 
Here's the problem: <BR> 
I want to setup Linux in our University's LAN but ran into problems, because 
the LAN is VINES-IP based so that normal TCP/IP packet drivers won't work.
The admin says I do need a driver which can tunnel the normal Linux TCP/IP 
packets into those VINES-IP packets, so that they can be send over the LAN to 
that box which has Internet connection....
<P> 
Maybe you know if such thing is available and/or where I can get it.
Or maybe you can give some Email-addresses for asking people which real 
knowledge 'bout Linux (maybe even that of Linus T. himself) and it's drivers.
<P> 
Hope you can help me 8-))

Thanks in advantage <BR>

(I've sent your problem on to Linux Journal's Technical Support column

<P> 
I did a search of LG, LJ and SSC's Linux Resources using VINES as the
keyword. I found only one entry from an author's biography. It's old --
March 1995 -- and the guy was in the marine corp then so may or may not
be a good address. Anyway here's what it said:<BR> 

&quot;Jon Frievald ... manages Wide Area Network running Banyan VINES. ...

There is one problem I had that may apply to you. Are you throwing away
previous issues and only getting the current one? If so, I apologize
most humbly. I was not aware until this month that people were doing this
and when I made the tar file I included only new files and those that had
been changed since the last month. To correct this problem I put a new
tar file on the ftp site called standard_gifs.html. It's not that I've
forgotten how to make http-ready distributions, it's that I'm just learning
all the complexities. In the future I will make the tar file to include
all files needed for the current single issue, whether they were changed
or not.

It's clever and pretty, but the spiral notebook graphic still trashes the 
left edge of letters printed in the issue 12 Mailbag.

Problem occurs using OS/2's Web Explorer version 1.2 (comes with OS/2 Warp 4.0).
Problem does NOT occur using Netscape 2.02 for OS/2 beta 2 (the latest beta 
for OS/2).
<P> 
Problem occurs even while accessing www.ssc.com/lg

(Problem will always occur with versions of either Microsoft Explorer or
Netscape before 2.0. It is caused by a bug in TABLES that was fixed in
the 2.0 versions. I don't have access to OS/2's Web Explorer, so I can
only guess that it's the same problem. I'd recommend always using the latest

<P> 
I run at a resolution of 1152x846 (a bit odd I suppose) and although the
Gazette pages look very nice indeed, it is a bit hard to read when I
have my Netscape window maximized.  The bindings part of the background
seems to be optimized for a width of 1024 and thus tiles over again on
the right side of the page.  This makes reading a bit difficult as some
of the text now overlaps the bindings on the far right.
<P>  
I'm not sure if that's a great description of the problem, but I can
easily make you a screenshot if you want to see what I mean.
<P> 
Anyhow, this is only a minor annoyance--certainly one I'm willing to
live with in order to read your great 'zine.  :)

<P> 
Hi,
<P> 
This is just to let you people know, that there might be a slight problem.
I want to point out and make it perfectly clear that this is NOT a
complaint. I feel perfectly satisfied with the Linux Gazette as it is.
<P> 
However sometimes I prefer to have a printed copy to take with me.
Therefore I used to print the LG. from Netscape. I'm using the new 3.1
version now. With the last two issues I have difficulties doing so.
All the pages with this new nice look don't print too well. The graphics
show up at all the wrong places and only one page is printed on the paper.
The rest is swallowed. Did you ever try to print it?
<P> 
I had to use an ancient copy of Mosaic, that doesn't know anything about
tables, to print these pages. They don't look too good this way too, and
never did. I know this old Mosaic is buggy. At least it doesn't swallow
half of the stuff. This could as well be a bug in Netscape.
I know next to nothing about html.
<P> 
Anyway, have fun.<BR> 
Regards Friedhelm
<blockquote> <I> 
(No, I don't try to print it, but will look into it. Are you printing out
&quot;The Whole Damn Thing&quot; from the TOC or trying to do it page by page?
It is out there in multi-file format and so if you print from say the Front Page,
the front page is all you'll get. &quot;The Whole Damn Thing&quot; is one single file 
containing the whole issue, and the spiral and table stuff are removed so it 
should print out for you okay. Let me know if this is already what you are
printing, so I'll know where to look for the problem. --Editor)

Well, Hi there!
<p>
Amazing. I've just read the Linux Gazette from the first issue to this
one, the 12th (actually I read just the first 7 issues through, because
the others were not downloaded correctly).
<p>
It's 4 in the morning and I'm enthusiastic. I knew Linux was good, I'm
using it for a year (this is because of the lack of my english grammar,
I mean the previous sentence, well...), so I knew it was good, but I
didn't expect to see something so nice like this Gazette.
<p>
It's good to see that there are a WHOLE LOT of people with huge will to
share.

I think we owe You a lot of thanks for starting it.

Merry Christmas, a Happy New Year, and keep it up!

Subject: <b> One-shot downloads </b><br>
From: David M. Razler, david.razler@postoffice.worldnet.att.net
<p>
Folks:
<p>
	While I realize that the economies of the LINUX biz require that  there
be some method of making money even on the distribution of free and
"free" software, I have a request for them of us who 1) are currently
scraping for the cash for our Internet accounts and 2) would like to try
LINUX.
<p>
	How about a one-shot download? I mean, oh, everything needed to
establish a LINUX system in one ZIP'ed (or tar/gz'd, though zip is a
more compatible format) file, one for each distribution?
<p>
	I'm currently looking to establish LINUX on my "spare" PC, a 386DX-16
w/4 meg and a scavenged 2500MB IDE drive, etc. It will be relatively
slow, limited, lacks a CD-rom drive, but it's free, since the machine is
currently serving as a paperweight.
<p>
	I could go out and buy a used CD-rom for the beast, or run a bastard
connection from my primary, indispensable work machine and buy the CDs.
But I am currently disabled and spending for these things has to be
weighed against other expenses (admittedly, I am certainly lucky and not
destitute, it would just be better)
<p>
	I could get a web robot and download umpteen little files, puzzle them
out and put them together, though the load on your server would be
higher.
<p>
	Or, under my proposed system, I could download Distribution Code,
Documents, and Major accessories in one group, then go back for the
individual bits and pieces I need to build my system.
<p>
	Again, I realize that running your site costs money, and that people
make money, admirably little money, distributing LINUX on CDs, with the
big bucks (grin) of LINUX coming in non-free software, support and book
sales.
<p>
	But if the system is to spread, providing a series of one-shot
downloads, possibly available only to individuals (I believe one could
copyright the *package* and require someone downloading to agree to use
it only on a single non-commercial system and not to redistribute, but I
am not an intellectual properties lawyer), to make life easier for them
of us who need to learn a UNIX-style system and build one on the cheap.

I too thought WhirlGIF (Graphics Muse, issue 12) was the greatest thing
since sliced bread (well, aside from PNG) when I first discovered it, but
for creating animations, it's considerably inferior to Andy Wardley's
<A HREF="http://www.peritas.com/~abw/multigif.html">MultiGIF</A>.  The
latter can specify tiny sprite images as parts of the animation, not just
full images.  For my PNG-balls animation (see http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/PNG/),
this resulted in well over a factor-of-two reduction in size (577k to 233k).
For another animation with a small, horizontally oscillating (Cylon eyes)
sprite, the savings was more than a factor of 20(!).
<P> 
MultiGIF is available as source code, of course.  (And I had nothing to do
with it, but I do find it darned handy.)

Regarding the posting in issue #12 of your gazette, how to backup the
current messages file & recreate, here is an alternative method...
<P> 
Place the lines at the end of this messages in a shell script
(/root/cron/swaplogs in this example).  Don't forget to make it +x! 
Execute it with 'sh scriptname', or by adding the following lines to
your (root's) crontab:
<PRE> 
# Swap logfiles every day at 1 am, local time
0 01 * * *       /root/cron/swaplogs
</PRE> 
The advantage to this method over renaming the logfile and creating a
new one is that in this method, syslogd is not required to be restarted.

</PRE> 
This is NOT an proper way of truncate /var/adm/messages.
<P> 
It is better to do: <BR> 
<ol> 
<li>cp /var/adm/messages /var/adm/messages.prev
<li>&gt;/var/adm/messages or cp /dev/null /var/adm/messages
(both of them makes the file empty).
<li>No more.
</ol>
The problem is that when you remove the /var/adm/messages syslogd
gets confused and unhappy and you have to give syslogd a HUPSIG
but if you just sets the file length to zero without removing the file
syslogd don't complain. And if you are really unlucky your system
will go down because you didn't create /var/adm/messages quick enough
or forgot it.

Info-ZIP encryption code
</H3>
Date: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 20:58:39 -0600 (CST) <BR>

<P> 
This is a relatively minor point, but Info-ZIP's Zip/UnZip encryption
code is *not* DES as reported in Robert Savage's article (LG issue 12).
It's actually considerably weaker, so much so that Paul Kocher has pub-
lished a known-plaintext attack (the existence of which is undoubtedly
the reason PKWARE was granted an export license for the code).  While
the encryption is good enough to keep your mom and probably your boss
from reading your files, those who desire *real* security should look
to PGP (which is also based on Info-ZIP code, but only for compression).
<P> 
And while I'm at it, Linux users will be happy to learn that the upcoming
releases of UnZip 5.3 and Zip 2.2 will be noticeably faster than the cur-
rent publicly released code.  In Zip's case this is due to a work-around
for a gcc bug that prevented a key assembler routine from being used--Zip
is now 30-40% faster on large files.  In UnZip's case the improvement is
due to a couple of things, one of which is simply better-optimized CRC
code.  UnZip 5.3 is about 10-20% faster than 5.2, I believe.  The new ver-
sions should be released in early January, if all goes well.  And then...
we start working on multi-part archives. :-)

Kernel Compile Woes

<P> 
Greetings.  Having been through hell after a recompile of my kernel, I
thought I'd pass this on.  
<P> 
It all started with me compiling a kernel for JAVA binary support..who
tell me do that. Somehow I think I got experimental code in..even worse :>
Anyway, it resulted in a crash, and I couldn't recompile since then.
<P> 
Well, after several cries for help, and trying all sorts of stuff, I
upgraded binutils to 2.7.0.3, and told the kernel to build elf support and
in elf format, and hey presto.  I'd been wrestling with the problem for
well over a week, and every time, I'd get an error.  Unfortunately, I had
to take out sound support, so I'm going to see if it'll add back in.
<P> 
I have to say thank you to the folks on the linux-kernel mailing list at
vger.rutgers.edu.  I posted there once, and had back at least 5 replies in
an hour.  (One came back in 10 minutes).
<P> 
As for the LG, it looks very nice seen thru Lynx 2-6 (no graphics to get
messed up :>)  I love the Weekend Mechanic, and the 2 cent tips mainly.
Perhaps one day I'll contribute something,.

Letter 1 to the LJ Editor re Titlebar
</h3>

To: linux@ssc.com

The Jan97 Issue 33 of <i>Linux Journal</i> contained the "Linux Gazette Two
Cent Tips". 
I was interested in the tip "X Term Titlebar Function". Although 
the text of the tip stated that the tip would work in ksh-based 
systems, I could not get it to work as shown. I think there are 
three problems. First, I think there are a few transcription 
errors in the script. Second, I believe the author is using 
embedded control characters and it was not obvious to me which 
character sequences are representations of control characters 
and which characters should be typed verbatim. Third, the 
author uses a command-line option to the echo command which 
is not available on all Unix platforms.
<p>
I finally used the following script:
<pre>
    if [ ${SHELL##/*/} = "ksh" ] ; then
        if [[ $TERM = x"term" ]] ; then
            HOSTNAME=`uname -n`
            label () { echo "\\033]2;$*\\007\\c"; }
            alias stripe='label $LOGNAME on $HOSTNAME - ${PWD#$HOME/}'
            cds () { "cd" $*; eval stripe; }
            alias cd=cds
            eval stripe
        fi
    fi
</pre>
I don't use vi, so I left out that functionality.
<p>
The functional changes I made are all in the arguments to the 
echo command. The changes are to use \\033 rather than what 
was shown in the original tip as ^[, to use \\007 rather than 
^G, and to terminate the string with \\c rather than use the 
option -n.
<p>
On AIX 4.1, the command &quot;echo -n hi&quot; echoes &quot;-n hi&quot;; in
other 
words, -n is not a portable command-line option to the echo 
command. I tested the above script on AIX 3.2, AIX 4.1, 
HPUX 9.0, HPUX 10.0, Solaris 2.4 and Solaris 2.5. I'm still 
trying to get Linux and my Wintel box mutually configured, 
so I haven't tested it on Linux.
<p>
I have noticed a problem with this script. I use the rlogin 
command to log in to a remote box. When I exit from the
remote box, the caption is not updated, and still shows the 
hostname and path that was valid just before I exited. I tried
adding
<pre>
    exits () { "exit" $*; eval stripe; }
    alias exit=exits
</pre>
and
<pre>
    rlogins () { "rlogin" $*; eval stripe; }
    alias rlogin=rlogins
</pre>
Neither addition updated the caption to the host/path 
returned to. Any suggestions?

<P> 
Some further clarification is needed with respect to the X Term Titlebar
Function tip in the Linux Gazette Two Cent Tips column of the January
1997 issue.  With regard to the -print option to find, Michael Hammel
says, &quot;Linux does require this.&quot; This is yet another example of &quot;Your
mileage may vary.&quot; Some versions of Linux do not require the -print
option.  And, although Solaris may not, SunOS 4.1.3_U1 and 4.1.4 do
require the -print option.  Also, if running csh or tcsh, remember to
escape wildcards in the file specification ( e.g. find ./ -name \*txt\* )
so that the shell doesn't attempt to expand them.  
<P> 
Second, for those tcsh fans out there, here is an xterm title bar function
for tcsh.
<P> 
NOTE:  This works on Slackware 3.0 with tcsh version 6.04.00, under the
tab, fv, and OpenLook window managers. Your mileage may vary.
<pre>
if ( $TERM == xterm ) then
  set prompt="%h> "
  alias cwdcmd 'echo -n "^[]2;`whoami` on ${HOST} - $cwd^G^[]1;${HOST}^G"'
  alias vi 'echo -n "^[]2;${HOST} - editing file-> \!*^G" ; vim \!* ;
cwdcmd'
  alias telnet '/bin/telnet \!* ; cwdcmd'
  alias rlogin '/usr/bin/rlogin \!* ; cwdcmd'
  cwdcmd
else
  set prompt="[%m]%~% "
endif
</PRE> 
<ol>
<li>Check to see if tcsh is running in an xterm.
<li>Set the prompt to show the current history event number.
<li>Set the alias cwdcmd to display the user, host, and current path in
    the xterm title bar, and set the icon name to the host name.  cwdcmd
    is a special tcsh alias, which if set holds a command that will be
    executed after changing the value of $cwd. 
<li>Set a vi alias to display the user, host, and file name under edit in
    the xterm title bar.  And run cwdcmd on exit to restore the xterm
    title bar and icon name.
<li>Alias telnet and rlogin to restore the xterm title bar and icon name 
    upon exit.  NOTE: Paths to telnet and rlogin may vary.
<li>Run the alias cwdcmd to set the initial xterm title bar and icon name.
<li>If this wasn't an xterm, set the prompt to show hostname and path.

<P> 
G'day,
<P> 
Just browsing through the mailbox, and I noticed your reply to a user
about HTML standard compliance and long download times. You replied that
you use the spiral image (a common thing these days) inside a &lt;TABLE&gt;.
<P> 
I hope you are aware that a browser cannot display any contents of a 
&lt;TABLE&gt; until it has received the &lt;/TABLE&gt; tag (no matter what version
of any browser - it is a limitation of the HTML tag) because the browser
cannot run its algorithm until it has received all of the &lt;TR&gt; and 
&lt;TD&gt; tags, and it can't be sure of that until the &lt;/TABLE&gt; tag comes
through. I have seen many complex sites, using many images (thankfully
they at least used the HEIGHT and WIDTH tags on those images to tell
the browser how big the image will be so it didn't have to download
it to find out) but still, putting it in a table nullifies much of the
speediness that users require. 
<P> 
A solution I often offer the HTML designers under me is to use a
&lt;DL&gt;&lt;DD&gt; combination. Though this doesn't technically fit the HTML DTD
(certain elements are not allowed in a &lt;DL&gt;) and I use an editor that
will not allow illegal HTML, so I can't do it myself (without going 
via a backdoor - but that's bad quality in my opionion). The downside
of the this is of course that you don't know what sized FONT the user
has set on the browser, and the FONT size affects the indetation width
of the &lt;DD&gt; element. But if your spiral image is not too wide, then 
that could be made a NULL factor. The plus to the &lt;DL&gt;&lt;DD&gt; is that the
page can be displayed instantly as it comes down (again..providing the
developer uses the HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes on *ALL* images so that
the browser doesn't have to pause it's display to get the image and work 
out how to lay out around the image)

Text File undelete
</H3>
Date: Sat, 7 Dec 1996 15:00:58 +1300 (NZDT) <BR> 
From: Michael Hamilton, <A HREF="mailto:michael@actrix.gen.nz">
michael@actrix.gen.nz </A> <BR> 
<P> 
Here's a trick I've had to use a few times.
<P> 
Desperate person's text file undelete.
<P> 
If you accidentally remove a text file, for example, some email, or
the results of a late night programming session, all may not be lost.
If the file ever made it to disk, ie it was around for more than 30
seconds, its contents may still be in the disk partition.
<P> 
You can use the grep command to search the raw disk partition for the
contents of file.  
<P> 
For example, recently, I accidentally deleted a piece of email.
So I immediately ceased any activity that could modify that partition:
in this case I just refrained from saving any files or doing any compiles
etc.  On other occasions, I've actually gone to the trouble of bring the
system down to single user mode, and unmounted the filesystem.
<P> 
I then used the egrep command on the disk partition:  in my case the email
message was in /usr/local/home/michael/, so from the output from df,
I could see this was in /dev/hdb5
<PRE> 
  sputnik3:~ % df
  Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
  /dev/hda3              18621    9759     7901     55%   /
  /dev/hdb3             308852  258443    34458     88%   /usr
  /dev/hdb5             466896  407062    35720     92%   /usr/local

  sputnik3:~ % su
  Password:
  [michael@sputnik3 michael]# egrep -50 'ftp.+COL' /dev/hdb5 > /tmp/x
</PRE> 
Now I'm ultra careful when fooling around with disk partitions, so I
paused to make sure I understood the command syntax BEFORE pressing
return.  In this case the email contained the word 'ftp' followed by
some text followed by the word 'COL'.  The message was about 20 lines
long, so I used -50 to get all the lines around the phrase.  In the
past I've used -3000 to make sure I got all the lines of some source
code.  I directed the output from the egrep to a different disk
partition - this prevented it from over writing the message I was
looking for.
<P> 
I then used strings to help me inspect the output
<PRE> 
  strings /tmp/x | less
</PRE> 
Sure enough the email was in there.  
<P> 
This method can't be relied on, all, or some, of the disk space may
have already been re-used.  
<P> 
This trick is probably only useful on single user systems.  On
multi-users systems with high disk activity, the space you free'ed up
may have already been reused.  And most of use can't just rip the box
out from under our users when ever we need to recover a file.
<P> 
On my home system this trick has come in handy on about three
occasions in the past few years - usually when I accidentally trash
some of the days work.  If what I'm working survives to a point where
I feel I made significant progress, it get's backed up onto floppy, so
I haven't needed this trick very often.
<P> 
Michael

In order to make DHCPD by ISC/Vixie to run under Linux, you should
have route to host 255.255.255.255. Standard "route" from Slackware
distribution does not like the string "route add -host 255.255.255.255
dev eth0". But you can add hostname to your /etc/hosts file with
address 255.255.255.255, and use "route add hostname dev eth0" instead.
It works.

Use of TCSH's :e and :r Extensions

From: Bill C. Riemers, <A HREF="mailto:bcr@feynman.com">bcr@feynman.com</A><BR> 
<P> 
I'd like to congratulate Jesper Pedersen on his article on tcsh
tricks.  Tcsh has long been my favorite shell.  But most of the features
Jesper hit upon are also found in bash.  Tcsh's most useful and unique
features are its variable/history suffixes.
<P> 
For example, if after applying a patch one wishes to undo things, by
moving the *.orig files to there base names, the :r extension which
means to strip the extension comes in handy.  e.g.
<PRE> 
 foreach a ( *.orig )
    mv $a $a:r
 end
</PRE> 
The same loop for ksh looks like:
<PRE> 
  for a in *.orig; do=20
    mv $a `echo $a|sed -e 's,\.orig$,,g'`
  done
</PRE> 
Even better, one can use the :e extension to extract the file extension.
For example, lets say we we want to do the same thing on compressed
files:

Various notes on 2c tips, Gazette 12
</H3>
Date: Wed, 04 Dec 1996 15:30:21 -0600 <BR> 
From: Justin Dossey, <A HREF="mailto:dossey@ou.edu">dossey@ou.edu </A> <BR>
<P> 
I noticed a few overly difficult or unnecessary procedures recommended
in the 2c tips section of Issue 12.  Since there is more than one, I'm
sending it to you:
<PRE> 
#!/bin/sh
         # lowerit
         # convert all file names in the current directory to lower case 
         # only operates on plain files--does not change the name of
directories
         # will ask for verification before overwriting an existing file
         for x in `ls`
           do
           if [ ! -f $x ]; then
             continue
             fi
           lc=`echo $x  | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`
           if [ $lc != $x ]; then
             mv -i $x $lc
           fi
           done
</PRE> 
Wow.  That's a long script.  I wouldn't write a script to do that;
instead, I would use this command:
<PRE> 
for i in * ; do [ -f $i ] && mv -i $i `echo $i | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`;
done;
</PRE> 
on the command line.
<P> 
The contributor says he wrote the script how he did for
understandability (see below).
<P> 
On the next tip, this one about adding and removing users, Geoff is
doing fine until that last step.  Reboot?  Boy, I hope he doesn't reboot
every time he removes a user.  All you have to do is the first two
steps.  What sort of processes would that user have going, anyway?  An
irc bot?  Killing the processes with a simple 
<PRE> 
kill -9 `ps -aux |grep ^<username> |tr -s " " |cut -d " " -f2`
</PRE> 
Example, username is foo
<PRE> 
kill -9 `ps -aux |grep ^foo |tr -s " " |cut -d " " -f2`
</PRE> 
That taken care of, let us move to the forgotten root password.
<P> 
The solution given in the Gazette is the most universal one, but not the
easiest one.  With both LILO and loadlin, one may provide the boot
parameter &quot;single&quot; to boot directly into the default shell with no login
or password prompt.  From there, one may change or remove any passwords
before typing ``init 3``to start multiuser mode.  
Number of reboots: 1
The other way
Number of reboots: 2
<P> 
That's just about it.  Thanks for the great magazine and continuing
contribution to the Linux community.  The Gazette is a needed element
for many linux users on the 'net.

Can't argue.  If I had written it for what I considered a high usage
situation I would have done it more like you suggested.  The intent,
however, was to make something that could be easily understood.

<h3><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/lil2cent.gif">
Viewing HOWTO Documents
</h3>
Date: Sun, 22 Dec 1996 09:43:40 -0800 <br>
From: Didier Juges, <a
href="mailto:dj@destin.nfds.net">dj@destin.nfds.net</a><br>
<p>
>From a newbie to another, here is a short script that eases looking for 
and viewing howto documents.
My howto's are in /usr/doc/faq/howto/ and are gzipped. The file names are 
XXX-HOWTO.gz, XXX being the subject.
I created the following script called "howto" in the /usr/local/sbin 
directory:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$1" = "" ]; then
    ls /usr/doc/faq/howto | less
else
    gunzip -c /usr/doc/faq/howto/$1-HOWTO.gz | less
fi
</pre>
When called without argument, it displays a directory of the available 
howto's. Then when entered with the first part of the file name (before 
the hyphen) as an argument, it unzips (keeping the original intact) then 
displays the document.
<p>
For instance, to view the Serial-HOWTO.gz document, enter:
$ howto Serial
<p>
Keep up the good work.

Xaw-XPM .Xresources troubleshooting tip.
</h3>

From: Robin Smidsroed, <a
href="mailto:dex@sysedata.no">dex@sysedata.no</a><br>
<p>
I'm sure a lot of you folks out there have installed the new Xaw-XPM and
like it a lot. But I've had some trouble with it. If I don't install the
supplied .Xresources-file, xcalc and some other apps (ghostview is one)
segfaults whenever you try to use them.
<p>
I found out that the entry which causes this, is this:
<pre>
*setPixmap: /path/to/an/xpm-file
</pre>
If this entry isn't in your .Xresources, xcalc and ghostview won't work. Hope
some of you out there need this.
<p>
And while you're at ghostview, remember to upgrade ghostscript to the latest
version to get the new and improved fonts, they certainly look better on
paper than the old versions.

Ciao! <br>

<h3><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/lil2cent.gif">
xterm title bar
</h3>
Date: Wed, 18 Dec 1996 21:21:47 -0800 (PST)
From: bradshaw@nlc.com (Lee Bradshaw)
<p>
Hi Guys,
<p>
I noticed the &quot;alias for cd xterm title bar tip&quot; from Michael
Hammel in
the <i>Linux Gazette</i> and wanted to offer a possible improvement for your
.bashrc file.  A similar solution might work for ksh, but you may need
to substitute $HOSTNAME for \h, etc:
<pre>
if [ "x$TERM" = "xxterm" ]; then
   PS1='\h \w-> \[\033]0;\h \w\007\]'
else
   PS1='\h \w-> '
fi
</pre>
PS1 is an environment variable used in bash and ksh for storing the
normal prompt.  \h and \w are shorthand for hostname and working
directory in bash.  The \[ and \] strings enclose non-printing
characters from the prompt so that command line editing will work
correctly.  The \O33]0; and \007 strings enclose a string which
xterm will use for the title bar and icon name.  Sorry, I don't
remember the codes for setting these independently.  (ksh users note:
\033 is octal for ESC and \007 is octal for CTRL-G.)  This example just
changes the title bar and icon names to match the prompt before the
cursor.
<p>
Any program which changes the xterm title will cause inconsistencies if
you try an alias for cd instead of PS1.  Consider rlogin to another
machine which changes the xterm title.  When you quit rlogin, there is
nothing to force the xterm title back to the correct value when using
the cd alias (at least not until the next cd).  This is not a problem
when using PS1.
<p>
You could still alias vi to change the xterm title bar, but it may not
always be correct.  If you use ":e filename" to edit a new file, vi
will not update the xterm title.  I would suggest upgrading to vim (VI
iMproved).  It has many nice new features in addition to displaying the
current filename on the xterm title.
<p>
Hopefully this tip is a good starting point for some more experimenting.
Good luck!
<p>

Thanks for reading this post. I have heard that it's possible to set up
Linux to combine two analog modems into one so as to double the speed of
a connection. Is this true, how does this work and where can I get more
info, guidance, how-to, etc.? I have Slackware 96 from Infomagic.

Dialup Problem
</h3>
Date: Tue, 31 Dec 1996 05:13:51 -0800 (PST) <BR> 
From: <A HREF="mailto:gekko@midusa.net">gekko@midusa.net</A><BR>
<P>
I don't know if you can, or even are willing, help me witha  problem i
have.  I'm running redhat 4.0, on a p120 w/24 megs of ram, kernel 2.0.18
<blockquote> <b> 
	I'm willing.
</b> </blockquote> 
anyway...i have this ppp connection problem and no I know knows what the
problem is, i've looked through the FAQS, HOWTO's, tried #linux on irc,
etc etc...no one knows what my problem is, so now i'm desperate.
<P>
When i try to dial my isp, i get logged in fine, but its REALLY slow.
i'm using the 'network module' ppp thing in control panel on X.
mru=1500, asyncmap=0,speed=115000, i couldn't find a place to insert
mtu, and when i tried putting that in /etc/ppp/options the script this
program was using wouldn't work.
<blockquote> <B> 
	Usually I see these symptoms when there is an IRQ
	conflict.  Some of the data gets through -- with lots
	of errors and lots of retransmits but any activity on the
	rest of the machine -- or even just sitting there --
	and you get really bad throughput and very unreliable
	connections.
</B> </blockquote> 
I noticed that after i input something and then move the cursor off of
the windows, it runs at a much faster speed, and it gets annoying moving
the cursor back and forth.
I tried dip, minicom, and this 'network module' thing...all are slow
<blockquote> <B> 
	I would do all of your troubleshooting from outside of
	X.  Just use the virtual consoles until everything else
	works right. (Fewer layers of things to conflict with
	one another).
</B> </blockquote> 
if you can shed any light on this, it would be much appreciated.
thanks
<blockquote> <B> 
	Take a really thorough look at the hardware settings for
	everything in the machine.  Make a list of all the cards
	and interfaces -- go through the docs for each one
	and map out which ones are using which interfaces.
<P> 
	I ended up going through several combinations of 
	video cards and I/O cards before I got my main system
	all integrated.  Luckily newer systems are  getting 
	better (this is a 386DX33 with 32Mb of RAM and a 
	2Mb video cards -- two IDE's, two floppy drives, two
	SCSI hardisks, an internal CD-ROM, and external magneto
	optical drive, a serial mouse, a modem (used for dial-in
	dial-out, uucp, and ppp) and null modem (I hook a laptop
	to it as a terminal for my wife) and an ethernet card.
<P> 
	Another thing to check is the cabling between your serial
	connector and your modem.  If you're configured for 
	XON/XOFF you're in trouble. If you're configured for
	hardware flow control and you don't have the appropriate
	wires in your cable than you're in worse trouble.
<P> 
	Troubleshooting of this sort really is best done over
	voice or in person.  There are too many steps to 
	the troubleshooting and testing to do effectively 
	via e-mail.

<H1>COMDEX '96</H1>
<H4>By Belinda Frazier, <a href="mailto:bel@ssc.com">bel@ssc.com</a>
and Kevin Pierce, <a href="mailto:kevin@ssc.com">kevin@ssc.com</a></H4>
</center>

<!--===================================================================-->

Comdex/Fall '96 has come and gone once again.
COMDEX is the second largest computer trade show in the world,
offering multiple convention floors with 2000 exhibitors plying their
new computer products to approximately 220,000 attendees in Las Vegas,
Nevada in November of 1996.
<p>
This year's show was a great success for Linux in general.
The first ever ``Linux Pavilion'' was organized at the Sands Convention
Center and Linux vendors from all over the country participated.
The Linux International (LI) booth was in the center, giving away 
literature and information for all the Linux Vendors.
Linux International is a not-for-profit organization formed to promote
Linux to computer users and organizations.
Staffed by volunteers including Jon ``Maddog'' Hall
and Steve Harrington, the LI
booth was a great place for people to go to have their questions
answered.  Needless to say, the Linux International Booth was never
empty. Surrounding LI, were Red Hat Software and WorkGroup Solutions. 
<p>
Other vendors in the pavilion included Craftwork Solutions, DCG Computers,
Digital Equipment Corporation, Frank
Kasper & Associates, Infomagic, Linux Hardware
Solutions, SSC (publishers of Linux Journal), and Yggdrasil Computing.
Caldera, Pacific HiTech, and Walnut Creek both exhibited at
Comdex, but not as part of the Linux Pavilion. 
<p>
SSC gave out Linux Journals at the show and actually ran out of magazines
early Thursday morning.  Luckily, we were able to have some more shipped to us,
but we still ran out again on Friday, the last day of the show.
Comdex ran five full days and the Sands pavilion was open from 8:30 to
6 most show days which meant long days for all the exhibitors there.
<p>
Show management put up signs, directing attendees to the Linux
Pavilion and to "more Linux vendors".  
The show was so large that it was easy to get lost.
<p>
At the LI booth and at SSC's booth, the response to Linux was
overwhelmingly positive. 
Questions ranged from ``I've heard a lot about Linux, but I'm
not sure what it is, can
you enlighten me?'' to ``I haven't checked for a few days---what is the
latest development kernel?''
<p>
For next year's Comdex in November '97, Linux vendors, coordinated by
Linux International, are already working to put together a Linux
pavilion at least three times as big as the one this year. 
<P> 
Vendors interested in being part of the Linux pavilion in November '97
may contact
Softbank who put on Comdex at mandino@comdex.com or to do this through Linux International,
contact ``Jon Maddog'' Hall via e-mail at <A

<h1>Filtering Advertisements from Web Pages using IPFWADM</h1>
<H4>By David Rudder
<a href="mailto:drig@magicweb.com">drig@magicweb.com</a></H4>
</center>
<P> <HR> <P>  

Lately, a lot of Web pages have begun selling ad space &quot;banners.&quot;
Wasting valuable bandwidth, these banners often hawk products I don't
care to hear about. I'd rather not see them, and not have to download
their contents.

<p>
There are two ways of filtering out these banners.  The first is to
deny all pictures that are wider than tall and generally towards the
top or bottom of the page.  The second is to simply block all the
accesses to and from the web sites that are the notorious advertisers.
This second approach is the one I'm going to take.

<p>
When searching around the web, you will see that many of the banners
come from the site ad.linkexchange.com.  This is the site we will want
to ban.

<P> <HR> <P>  
<center><h3>Setting Up Your Firewall</h3></center>
<p>
Our first order of business is to set up our firewall.  We won't be
using it for security, although this doesn't prohibit also using the
firewall for security.  First, we recompile the kernel, saying
&quot;Yes&quot;
to CONFIG_FIREWALL.  This allows us to use the built in kernel
firewalling.

<p>
Then, we need to get the IPFWADM utility.  You can find it at:
<a
	  href="http://www.xos.nl/linux/ipfwadm">http://www.xos.nl/linux/ipfwadm
</a>.  Untar, compile and install this utility.

<p>
Since we are doing no other firewalling, this should be sufficient.
</p>

<P> <HR> <P>  
<center><h3>Blocking Unwanted Sites</h3></center>
<p>
Now, we come to the meat of the maneuver.  We need now to block access
to our machine from ad.linkexchange.com.  First, block out access to
the sight, so that our requests don't even make it there.

<tt>ipfwadm -O -a reject -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D ad.linkexchange.com 80</tt><br>
<p>
This tells ipfwadm to append a rule to the Output filter.  The rule
says to reject all packets of protocol TCP from anywhere to
ad.linkexchange.com on port 80.  If you don't get this, read Chris
Kostick's excellent article on IP firewalling at
<a href="http://www.ssc.com/lj/issue24/1212.html">
http://www.ssc.com/lj/issue24/1212.html</a>.  

<p>
The next rule is to keep any stuff from ad.linkexchange.com from
coming in.  Technically, this shouldn't be necessary.  If we haven't
requested it, it shouldn't come.  But, better safe than sorry.

<tt>ipfwadm -I -a reject -P tcp -S ad.linkexchange.com 80 -D 0.0.0.0/0</tt><br>
<p>
Now, all access to and from ad.linkexchange.com is rejected.

<p>
<em>Note:</em> this will only work when web browsing from that machine.  To
filter for a whole network, do them same but with -F instead of -O and
-I.  

<P> <HR> <P>  
<center><h3>Testing It Out</h3></center>
<p>
To test, visit the site <a href="http://www.reply.net">http://www.reply.net</a>.  They have a banner on
top which should either not appear or appear as a broken icon.  Either
way, no network bandwidth will be wasted downloading the picture, and
all requests will be rejected immediately.
</p>

<P> <HR> <P>  
<center><h3>Filling It Out</h3></center>
<p>
Not all banners are so easily dealt with.  Many companies, like Netscape, host their
own banners.  You don't want to block access to Netscape, so this
approach won't work.  But, you will find a number of different
advertisers set up like linkexchange.  As you find more, add them to
the list of rejected sites.
</p>
Good luck, and happy filtering!

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Floppy Disk Tips</H1>

<P>Although more computers are becoming network connected every day,
there are many instances where you need to transfer files by the ol'
<I>sneaker-net</I> method.  Here are some hints, tips and short-cuts for doing
this, aimed at users who are new to Linux or Unix.  (There may even be
some information useful to old-timers...)

<UL>
 <LI><A HREF="#FORMAT">Formatting, Filesystems and Mounting</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#BACKUP">Backups, Cpio and Gzip</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#LARGE">Floppy as a Raw Device for Large Files or Directories</A>
 <LI><A HREF="#MISC">Miscellaneous</A>
</UL>

<P>What do I use floppies for?  As a consultant, I frequently do contract
work for companies which, because of security policies, do not connect
to the 'Net.   So, FTP'ing files which I need from my network at home is out of
the question.

<P>My current contract as an example, I am using Linux as an X-Windows terminal
for developing software on their DEC Alphas running OSF.  (I blew away the
Windoze '95 which they had loaded on the computer they gave me.)  I often need to bring
files with me from my office at home, or backup my work to take back home
for work in the evening.  (Consultants sometimes work <I>flex-hours</I>, which generally
means more hours...)<P>

<P>Why use <B>cpio</B>(1) or <B>tar</B>(1) when copying files?  Because it is a
<I>portable</I> method of transferring files from a group of subdirectories
with the file dates left intact.  The <B>cp</B>(1) command may or may not do the
job depending on Operating Systems and versions you are dealing with.
In addition, specifying certain options will only copy files which are new or
have changed.
<P>

<A NAME="FORMAT">
<P><HR NOSHADE><P>
<H2>Formatting, Filesystems and Mounting</H2></A>
<P><HR NOSHADE><P>

The first thing you need to do to make the floppies useful is to format them,
and usually lay down a filesystem.  There are also some preliminary steps
which make using floppy disks much easier, which is the point of this article.

<P>I find it useful to make my username part of the <B>floppy</B> group in the
<B>/etc/group</B> file.  This saves you from needing to su to root much of
the time.  (You will need to log out and log back in again for this to take
effect.)
I also use the same username both on the client's machine and
my home office which saves time. The line should now look like this:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
floppy::11:root,<EM>username</EM>
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The following setup is assumed for the examples I present here.
The root user must have the system directories in the <STRONG>PATH</STRONG>
environment variable.
Add the following to the <B>.profile</B> file in /root if not already there by
su'ing to root.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
su -   # this should ask for the <EM>root</EM> password.
cat >> <B>.</B>profile
PATH=/sbin<B>:</B>/usr/sbin<B>:</B>$PATH
&lt;ctrl&gt;-D
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!-- TIP TAG -->
You can also use your favorite editor to do this...  I prefer <B>vim</B>(1) and
have this <I>symlink</I>ed to <B>/usr/bin/vi</B> instead of <B>elvis</B>(1) which is
usually the default on many distributions.  VIM has online help, and multiple
window support which is very useful!  (A <I>symlink</I> is created with a
<B>-s</B> option to <B>ln</B>(1), and is actually called a
<I>sym</I>bolic&nbsp;<I>link</I>.)

<P>Next, add the following lines to the <B>/etc/fstab</B> file:
(I have all the user mountable partitions in one place under <B>/mnt</B>.
You may want a different convention, but this is useful.  I also have
/mnt/cdrom symlinked to /cd for convenience.)<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
/dev/fd0    /mnt/fd0  ext2    noauto,user 1 2
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Still logged in as root, make the following symlink:
(If you have more than one floppy drive, then add the floppy number
as well.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
ln  -s  /mnt/fd0  /fd

    -or-

ln  -s  /mnt/fd0  /fd0
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
These two things make mounting and unmounting floppies a cinch.  The
<B>mount</B>(8) command follows the symlink and
accesses the <B>/etc/fstab</B> file for any
missing parameters, making it a useful shortcut.


<P>To make the floppy usable as an ext2fs Linux filesystem, do the following
as root:
(The <I>username</I> is whatever username you use on regularly on the
system.  You, of course, should not use the <I>root</I> user for normal
use!)
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
export PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:$PATH   # not needed if you set environment
fdformat /dev/fd0
mke2fs /dev/fd0
mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/fd0
chown username /mnt/fd0
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


You may need to specify the geometry of the floppy you are using.
If it is the standard 3.5 inch double sided disk, you may need to
substitute <B>/dev/fd0H1440</B> for the device name (in 1.2.x kernels).
If you have a newer 2.xx kernel and <B>superformat</B>(1), you may want
to substitute this for <B>fdformat</B>.  See the notes in the
<A HREF="#MISC">Miscellaneous</A> section below, or look at the man page.
You may now exit out of <B>su</B>(1) by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
exit
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>From this point on, you may use the <B>mount</B>(8) and <B>umount</B>(8) 
commands logged in as your normal username by typing the following:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
mount /fd
umount /fd
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="BACKUP">
<P><HR NOSHADE><P>
<H2>Backups, Cpio and Gzip</H2></A>
<P><HR NOSHADE><P>

<P>For backing up my work to take home or to take back to the office I use
<B>cpio</B>(1) instead of <B>tar</B>(1) as it is far more flexible, and
better at handling errors etc.  To use this on a regular basis, first create
all the files you need by specifying the command below <EM>without</EM>
the <B>-mtime -1</B> switch.  Then you can make daily backups from the base
directory of your work using the following commands:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
cd <EM>directory</EM>
mount /fd
find <B>.</B> -mtime -1 -print | cpio -pmdv /fd
sync
umount /fd
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
When the floppy stops spinning, and the light goes out, you have your
work backed up.  The <B>-mtime</B> option to <B>find</B>(1) specifies
files which have been modified (or created) within one day (the <B>-1</B>
parameter).  The options for <B>cpio</B>(1) specify <EM>copy-pass</EM> mode,
which retain previous file modification times, create directories where needed,
and do so verbosely.  Without a <B>-u</B> (<I>unconditional</I>) flag, it will
not overwrite files which are the same age or newer.

<P>
This operation may also be done over a network, either from NFS mounted filesystems,
or by using a remote shell as the next example shows.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
mount /fd
cd /fd
rsh  remotesystem '(cd <I>directory</I>; find <B>.</B> -mtime -1 -print | cpio -oc)' |
     cpio -imdcv
sync
cd
umount /fd
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This example uses <B>cpio</B>(1) to send files from the remote system, and
update the files on the floppy disk mounted on the local system.  Note the
<I>pipe</I> (or veritical bar) symbol at the end of the remote shell line.
The arguments which are enclosed in quotes are executed remotely, with
everything enclosed in braces happening in a subshell.  The <I>archive</I>
is sent as a stream across the network, and used as input to the <B>cpio</B>(1)
command executing on the local machine.  (If both systems are using a recent
version of GNU cpio, then specify <B>-Hcrc</B> instead of <B>c</B> for the
archive type.  This will do error checking, and won't truncate inode numbers.)<BR>
The remote system would have:  <I>cpio -oHcrc</I><BR>
and the local side would have:  <I>cpio -imdvHcrc</I><P>

<P>To restore the newer files to the other computer, change directories to
the <I>base directory of your work</I>, and type the following:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
cd <EM>directory</EM>
mount -r /fd
cd /fd
find <B>.</B> -mtime -1 -print | cpio -pmdv ~-
cd -
umount /fd
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If you needed to restore the files completely, you would of course leave out
the <B>-mtime</B> parameter to <B>find</B>(1).
<P>

<!-- TIP TAG -->
<P>The previous examples assume that you are using the <B>bash</B>(1) shell,
and uses a few quick tricks for specifying directories.  The &quot;<B>~-</B>&quot;
parameter to cpio is translated to the <I>previous default directory</I>.
In other words, where you were before cd'ing to the /fd directory.
(Try typing: <TT>echo ~-</TT> to see the effect, after you have changed
directories at least once.)
The <B>cd ~-</B> or just <B>cd -</B> command is another shortcut to switch
directories to the previous default.  These shortcuts often save a lot of time
and typing, as you frequently need to work with two directories, using this
command to alternate between them or reference files from where you were.



<P>If the directory which you are tranferring or backing up is larger than
a single floppy disk, you may need to resort to using a compressed archive.
I still prefer using <B>cpio</B>(1) for this, although <B>tar</B>(1) will
work too.  Change directories to your work directory, and issue the following
commands:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
cd <EM>directory</EM>
mount /fd
find <B>.</B> -mtime -1 -print | cpio -ovHcrc | gzip -v > /fd/backup.cpio.gz
sync
umount /fd
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The <B>-Hcrc</B> option to cpio(1) is a new type of archive which older
versions of cpio might not understand.  This allows error checking, and
inode numbers with more than 16 bits.

<P>Of course, your original archive should be created using <B>find</B>(1)
without the <I>-mtime -1</I> options.

<H2>Floppy as a Raw Device for Large Files or Directories</H2></A>
<P><HR NOSHADE><P>

Sometimes it is necessary to backup or transfer a file or directories which
are larger than a floppy disk, even when compressed.  For this, we finally
need to resort to using tar.

<P>Prepare as many floppies as you think you'll need by using the <B>fdformat</B>(8)
command.  You do not need to make filesystems on them however, as you will be
using them in <I>raw</I> mode.

<P>If you are backing up a large set of subdirectories, switch to the base
subdirectory and issue the following command:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
cd <EM>directory</EM>
tar  -cv -L 1440 -M -f /dev/fd0  <B>.</B>
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This command will prompt you when to change floppies.  <STRONG><EM>Wait for the
floppy drive light to go out of course!</EM></STRONG>

<P>If you need to backup or transfer multiple files or directories, or just a single
large file, then specify them instead of the period at the end of the tar command
above.
<!-- I made the period bold, as it didn't show up very well otherwise -->

<P>Unpacking the archive is similar to the above command:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
cd <EM>directory</EM>
tar  -xv -L 1440 -M -f /dev/fd0
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><HR NOSHADE><P>

Finally, here are some assorted tips for using floppies.

<P>The <B>mtools</B>(1) package is great for dealing with MS-DOG
floppies, as we sometimes must.  You can also <B>mount</B>(8) them as a Linux
filesystem with either msdos or umsdos filesystem types.  Add another
entry to the <B>/etc/fstab</B> entry you made before, so that the two
lines will look like this:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
/dev/fd0    /mnt/fd0  ext2    noauto,user 1 2
/dev/fd0    /mnt/dos  msdos   noauto,user 1 2
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You can now mount an MS-DOS floppy using the command:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
mount /mnt/dos
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You can also symlink this to another name as a further shortcut.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
ln -s /mnt/dos /dos
mount /dos
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<!-- TIP TAG -->
<P>The danger of using the <B>mount</B>(8) commands rather than <B>mtools</B>(1)
for users who are more familiar with MSDOS, is that <B><I>you need to explicitly
unmount floppies</I></B> before taking them out of the drive using
<B>umount</B>(8).
Forgetting this
step can make the floppy unusable!  If you are in the habit of forgetting, a simple
low-tech yellow Post-it note in a strategic place beside your floppy drive might
save you a few headaches.  If your version of Post-it notes has the &lt;BLINK&gt;
tag, use it!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>;-)</TT><BR>

<P>Newer systems based on the 2.xx kernel are probably shipped with <B>fdutils</B>.
Check to see if you have a <B>/usr/doc/fdutils-xxx</B> directory,
where xxx is a version number.  (Mine is 4.3).
Also check for the <B>superformat</B>(1) man page.  This supersedes
<B>fdformat</B>(1) and gives you options for packing much more
data on floppies.  If you have an older system, check the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.imag.fr/pub/Linux/ZLIBC/fdutils/">ftp://ftp.imag.fr/pub/Linux/ZLIBC/fdutils/</A>
ftp site for more information.

<P>The naming convention for floppies in newer 2.xx kernels has also changed,
although the <B>fd</B>(4) man page has not been updated in my distribution.
If you do not have a <B>/dev/fd0H1440</B> device, then you probably have the newer
system.

		<H4>OpenGL Programming for the X Window System </H4>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		I noticed a new text on the shelf of a local book store
		(Softpro, in Englewood, Colorado) this past month - Mark J. Kilgard's
		<I>OpenGL Programming for the X Window System</I>.  This book,
		from Addison Wesley Developers Press, appears to have a very good
		coverage of how to write OpenGL applications that make use of X Windows
		API's.  I haven't read it yet (or even purchased it - yet, but I
		will) so can't say how good it is.  Mark is the author of the GLUT
		toolkit for OpenGL.  GLUT is to OpenGL what Xt or Motif is to Xlib.
		Well, sort of.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		I've been talking to a couple of publishers about doing a book aimed at 
		Linux users.  I'd like to write a User's Guide for the Gimp but the
		publisher feels a more general text on doing Web-based graphics might have
		a wider appeal (face it - the Linux audience just isn't the size of the MS
		audience - yet - but the publishers are considering both types of books).  
		I told them I'd ask my readers which type of text
		they'd like to see.  The Gimp book would include details on how to
		use each of the applications features as well as a number of tutorials for
		doing various types of effects.  The book on doing graphics for Web pages
		would include discussions on using HTML, information on tools besides the
		Gimp and a few case studies (including something on animation).  However,
		the Web book wouldn't go into as much detail for each of the tools.
		That information would be more general in nature.

		<H4>A Gimp User's Story (or "Why I Use the Gimp")</H4>
		The following piece was posted on the Gimp User's Mailing
		list by <A HREF="mike@lawlib.wm.edu"> Mike Phillips</A>.
		<P>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		At work, we have a "Library News Network", which is actually a 386 pc 
		running a TV via a video converter in a continual slideshow with 
		information about upcoming events in the law library and the law school.  
		Last year, my boss did some stuff in Freelance Graphics which, quite 
		frankly, was rather limited in effect.
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		This year, it's my baby, and I'm making the slideshow (640x480x256 GIF 
		files, run by a simple DOS program and looped by a batch file) in the 
		GIMP.  Here are some things I've done to make the text more readable 
		and make the display reasonably eye-catching.  Nothing fancy, but 
		hopefully the tricks will give other people ideas to play with on their
		own.
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		First, don't use a plain background.  The blend tool is very nice for 
		this, and shaded green or blue with bright text is rather nice looking.  
		Start with a color and add some noise Create a blend image of the
		same size and multiply by the image with noise.  This creates a
		<I>very</I> cool background for a slide.  Better yet, if there's an 
		appropriate photograph, use it!  (I used a gorgeous picture of Yosemite 
		Park to announce an environmental law symposium, and a decent photo of 
		the U.S. Supreme Court justices to announce our Supreme Court Preview.)
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		On the subjects of backgrounds, since I don't remember seeing this tip, 
		here's a quickie for clouds: Make a plasma of the appropriate size, 
		grayscale it, convert it back to color, and Brightness/Contrast/Gamma it 
		into submission.  I usually knock the brightness up about 75-100, and the 
		blue up to around 5 and the green to about 2.  Instant pretty sky 
		(Obviously, skies from other planets could be done with reds and greens 
		and whatnot.)
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		For the text, nothing beats some good fonts.  Hit a 
		<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/fonts/">font archive</A>, 
		or buy 
		a $10-$15 CD filled with fonts.  Granted, I have the Caldera Network 
		Desktop, so I can use some fonts that (I think) XFree can't, thanks to 
		the font server, but it's worth a shot.  I got a CD with 1250 fonts for 
		$13.
		[Ed. Next month I'll cover how to add fonts to your system so you
		can use them with the Gimp.  mjh]
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Here's a variation on the 
		<A HREF="http://abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu/~nem/gimp/">rounded-text tips</A>: 
		work out your 
		text, then Duplicate it once and Offset it once (say 4x4).  Edge Detect 
		then Invert the duplicate and Gaussian Blur the offset twice.  Multiply 
		the resulting ../gx/hammel, and use the original as a mask to composite 
		something else over the image resulting from the multiplication.  
		Very nice, edged & floating/shadowed 
		text.  Shows up great on a TV monitor.
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		For the text, use any appropriate single color.  Bright colors and high 
		contrast work very well for what I do, although I've played with 
		textures, rippled blends, plasma clouds, and what-not.
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Of course, it can be spiced up with all sorts of clipart (I heartily 
		recommend 
		<A HREF="http://www.barrysclipart.com"> 
		Barry's Clipart Server (www.barrysclipart.com)</A>,

		Recently, while wandering through the plug-ins available, I found the 
		charcoal plug-in.  Compiled it, added it, used it.  Rather nifty, actually.
		However, it got me thinking and experimenting, and I produced two 
		potentially interesting effects:

		<P>
		(1) Pastel sketch:  Take a color (RGB) image, Edge-detect it, Invert, and
		(optionally) contrast autostretch.  On many ../gx/hammel, this will produce a 
		nifty pastel sketch.  If the image is too high of detail, degrade the 
		color or pixelize it first, otherwise you may end up with too many 
		extraneous lines.
		<P>
		(2) Watercolor sketch: Take a color (RGB) image, make a grayscale of it.
		Edge Detect the grayscale (this will give you the sketch lines); this can
		be hard to balance the way you want, so you may want to threshold it or 
		pixelize the image first.  Then, pixelize and degrade the main image to 
		32 colors (16 or 20 works even better).  Eliminate the background you 
		don't want, Gaussian blur it a few times, and brighten it some.  
		Multiply the edging onto it.  Voila; (nearly) instant watercolor, 
		akin to the court sketches on news shows.

		Everything I know
		I've learned in the last year or so by reading, examining source
		code, and through the kind assistance of many members of the Net.
		So my ability to understand some of the more formal texts on
		computer graphics is limited.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Given this limitation, I found I was still able to read and
		comprehend a good portion of Jim Blinn's book
		<I>Jim Blinn's Corner - A Trip Down the Graphics Pipeline</I>, which
		is a collection of articles taken from his column in the <I>IEEE Computer
		Graphics and Applications</I> journal.  This book is the first of what may
		be two books, assuming there is sufficient interest in the first book.  The
		second will cover a set of pixel arithmetic articles taken from the same
		column.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		In the preface Jim describes how he used a writing style that is
		"certainly lighter than a typical SIGGRAPH paper, both in depth and in
		attitude."  I can't agree more.  Computer graphics should be a fun
		subject and, despite the math, this book does provide a giggle here
		and there.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Don't get me wrong, though.  There is plenty of the technical details
		on how to compute positions in 3D space, perspective shadows, and
		subpixelic particles.  Hefty stuff for the beginner.  Nearly
		incomprehensible to the person who hasn't used matrix arithmetic in the
		past 8 years.  Still, chapters like <B>The Ultimate Design Tool</B>
		(which talks about how an idea should start), and <B>Farewell to
		Fortran</B> (which talks about using various languages in computer
		graphics) provided enough non-mathematical discussions to let my brain
		recover while still keeping my interest peaked.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		I haven't read the book front to back yet.  I'm saving whats left
		(about half the book) for my 16 days of freedom scheduled to start later
		this month.  Its first on my reading list.  Second will be my college
		Linear Algebra text.  The first half of Jim's book reminded me about how
		much I'd forgotten in 8 years.  Like the saying goes, one must strive
		for the impossible before they know what is possible.

		vary but raytracing tools are preferred and no post processing is 
		allowed (for example, you can't add a lens flare after the image
		has been rendered).  Anyone is allowed to vote (currently) on the
		../gx/hammel and winners receive small prizes like CDs and prints of their
		../gx/hammel.

<H4>Review: The AC3D Modeller</H4>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There are only a few 3D modellers available for Linux:  AMAPI (which may
now only be available for the Mac, based on one report I've received),
Midnight Modeller, SCED/SCEDA, and AC3D.  Each of these has its advantages
and disadvantages.  I've tried each of these at least briefly.  A couple,
SCED and AC3D, I've used to actually create scenes.  Lets take a quick look
at one of these - AC3D.  
<table width=100%>
<tr>

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	<A HREF="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/users/andy/ac3dlinux.html">AC3D</A> 
	comes from <A HREF="mailto:andy@comp.lancs.ac.uk">Andy Colebourne</A>.  It
	is a shareware modeller that comes in binary format only.  It is available
	for Linux, SGI's and Sun's (both SunOS and Solaris).  Once registered you have access to a
	private Web site from which you can download the full version of the software.
	Documentation is a bit sparse (a common problem with much of the software
	available for Linux, in this authors opinion), consisting of about
	12 or 13 pages formatted in either HTML or Postscript.  The distribution
	package contains the binary, the HTML manual with a few ../gx/hammel, and a set
	of object files that are necessary for packages which use the Mesa Graphics
	Library, which AC3D does.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The interface consists of 4 view windows and a control panel.  There are 3
orthographic views and a 3D view.  Changes in one of the orthographic view
windows are reflected in the other views.  Edits are not allowed in the 3D
view.  The 3D view can provide wireframe, filled or textured surfaces.
My system is not quite fast enough to handle anything but the wireframe
surface so I won't be able to say much about the texturing features of
the modeller.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
AC3D supports a number of import file formats, including DXF and Lightwave
files.  It can export POV, RIB, VRML and a couple of other formats.  Since
the modeller is a based on vertices (as opposed to primitives like spheres
or boxes) it is quite easy to manipulate basic shapes into more complex
ones.  This can be a disadvantage to those used to the CSG aspects of SCED
or users of POV-Ray, but it really doesn't take that long to get used to.
Even though the modeller bases its shapes on vertices, there are still a
collection of basic shapes provided:  disk, line, box, sphere, and mesh are
just some of these.  These shapes are displayed with a given number of
vertices.  The number of vertices can be configured and its possible to add
more vertices where necessary.

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	One of the nicest features is the ability to extrude a 2D shape into 3
	dimensions.  Lets follow an example of this.  First, select the "ellipse"
	drawing function from the control panel and create a stretched out ellipse
	in the XY orthographic view.

<tr>
<td>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Next, change the <I>Edit</I> type to "vertex" in the control panel and select all
	the vertices on the lower half of the ellipse (but not the ones on the end
	of the ellipse).  Delete these with the "delete" function in the control
	panel.  Then select the two lowest vertices and insert some new vertices (as
	shown in Figure 3).

<tr>

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	This next part is a little tricky.  What you want to do is select the
	vertices on each end of the object and move them, one at a time, until you
	get a slightly rounded effect.  Then select 4 or 5 of the vertices on the
	back end (the left side in Figure 4) and strecth them out a little, to
	flatten the wings trailing edge.  Then get rid of the extra vertices along
	the bottom of the wings edge by selecting them and using the "delete"
	function in the control panel.  The result should look something like
	Figure 4.

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	This isn't bad, but a wing should be smoother around the top and edges,
	so change the <I>Edit</I> type to "Object" and select the wing.  Then
	use the "Spline Surfaces" option from the <I>Object</I> pull-down menu.
	This adds a bunch of new vertices to the object and creates a smoother

	Now lets take this simple shape and extrude it.  Make sure the
	<I>Edit</I> type is still "Object" and select the wing edge.  We need
	to change to the XZ orthographic view window.  Up to this point we've 
	been using the XY viewport.  Click on "Extrude" under the <I>Mouse</I>
	options in the control panel.  Grab the object in the XZ viewport and
	drag up.  The original points stay put and a new set of points is moved
	to where ever you drag to.  Once you let go of the mouse button you'll
	see the new points get connected to their corresponding points on the 
	original object.  Notice how the connecting lines aren't quite straight.
	This would be bad for a real wing, so we'll straighten them out.

	In this next figure, the control panel was used to change the
	<I>Edit</I> mode to "vertices" and the vertices on the 
	new side of the extruded object
	have been selected.  Once selected, the "move" option under the
	<I>Mouse</I> features allows the selected vertices to be moved as a
	group.  When these vertices are moved the lines connecting them to the
	opposite end are redrawn.  You can play with this a bit in order to get the
	connecting lines to become straight.  Note that its not absolutely
	necessary to correctly align the two ends of the extruded object, but this
	is one way to do so if you feel it necessary.

	Now switch back to the "object" <I>Edit</I> mode and select the object.

	Next, switch back to "vertices" <I>Edit</I> mode and select the vertices
	on one end of the object.  Click on "Create Surface" under
	<I>Functions</I> in the control panel.  If the surface (as viewed in the 3D
	view) does not appear solid you can select "Poly" under <I>Surface</I> to
	create a solid surface to close the end of the object.  Repeat this process
	for the other end.

	<P>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Viola!  You've got a solid surfaced wing, just like the one in Figure 9.
	(The grid is an option for the 3D view window and not part of the image.)
	Of course, this is a pretty simplistic example, but you should get the
	idea of how easy it is to create shapes using AC3D.  You'll need to export
	the file to POV or RIB format and add some real textures to finish up the
	project, of course.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When I first started examining modellers I got my hands on SCED, a nifty
modeller from Stephen Chenney.  One of the nice features of SCED is that it
is constraint based - you can join objects using CSG and then constrain
them to certain points.  This allows you to create an arm, for example,
that can bend only at the elbow.  AC3D works similarly in that you can
rotate any set of points around a single point within one of the
orthographic views.  For example, if I created an arm I could select
"Rotate" from the control panel and then use the mouse to rotate the arm
around a single point, such as the elbow, in one of the 2D view windows.
If I need it to move in 3D I need to do this type of rotation in 2 or more
of the 2D view windows.  This process is a little different than SCED,
which can move objects in 3 dimensions, but the result is the same.  In
fact, at times it can be a little easier to keep your bearings using
multiple rotations in 2D.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Since I've never used any of the modellers available for other systems 
(such as high end modellers on SGI's or any of the modellers available for
Microsoft or Mac systems)
I can't say how well AC3D compares to them.  I do know that I found the
modeller fairly easy to learn, but I tend to be more motivated than some
folks.  AC3D could use some online help (whats the difference between a
"Poly" and a "Polyline", for example) and more detailed documentation in
general.  It would also be nice to be able to unhide selected objects
instead of all hidden objects.  Andy has told me that a new version coming
soon will include the ability to specify the exact dimensions of a selected
object or set of vertices.  This is a very important feature in my eyes.  I
tend to like to use modellers to create individual objets and then use the
conditional constructs of POV-Ray to position multiple copies of them, such
as trees or rocks or houses.  By constraining an object to a unit size it
makes it easier to position and resize objects using POV-Ray.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Of all the modellers I've tried AC3D is probably the easiest to use.  Its
ability to import formats like DXF gives it a step up on SCED, although I
really like the latter too.  I don't particularly mind that you don't get
the source to AC3D since I'm mostly interested in just using the modeller
and not in developing new features for it.  It would be nice if there were a
plug-in interface, but I'm not such a power user yet that I need that
feature.  Aside from a lack of detailed documentation, and a few keystrokes
that are already used by fvwm, I find the AC3D modeller worth the
registration price.

The contest started in earnest in May/June of 1996.  The topic then was
Time and there were some stunning entries.  In July/August we had fewer
entries, but the topic - Summer - was a little tougher to nail down.
In September/October we hit the jackpot with Science Fiction.  Well over
200 entries were submitted for this round.  Thats quite a difference from
the 20-30 submitted during Matt's original contests.  Fortunately much of
the work for viewing, voting, and tabulating information has been
automated.   The contest has been great fun and has been accompanied with
lively discussions on the associated irtc-l mailing list.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Unfortunately, there are always those that have to try to ruin things
for everyone else.  We had some people submit ../gx/hammel that were fair but not
likely winners.  They then submitted multiple votes.  A vote consists of
ratings of all the ../gx/hammel with values between 1-20 for each in 3 
categories - needless to say
this takes awhile to accomplish.  Any vote that does not include ratings
for all ../gx/hammel is not counted in the final tally.  The multiple votes were
done offline (which is permissable) and submitted from different email
accounts.  The artists ../gx/hammel received very high marks while all the rest
received very low (within a very small range) ratings.  Then they got some
of their friends to do the same thing.  Beyond this, others have 
submitted numerous entries that they had made in the past (prior to
the contest) that just happen to fit the category (how many 3D artists, for
fun or profit, have *never* made a space scene?) in order to turn the
contest into their own private gallery.  The spirit of the competition is
lost on some people, I'm afraid.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I haven't done any of the automation nor have I worked on the very
nice web site for the contest.  But I've watched Chip and Bill do so.
Its very frustrating knowing how much effort they put into this,
trying very hard not to give themselves or anyone else unfair advantages
and still make the contest fun for everyone only to see someone still try
to cheat the system.  Why?  For a couple of CDs?  Remember when the
Internet was a friendly, honest place?
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Still, the contest continues and the Admin Team is working on ways
of keeping the contest fun, open to participation, and fair.  The
guys could use a new host for their contest.  Walnut Creek, the current
host, appears to be limiting ftp connections and the amount of disk space
required for 200+ ../gx/hammel can get rather large. 
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If you are into 3D rendering for the fun of it you owe it to yourself
to take a shot at the IRTC.  Its fun to see how your ../gx/hammel stack
up against others.  Many of the voters offer comments on the ../gx/hammel which
can very useful in any future ../gx/hammel you render.  Check our the

<H4>History of the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format</H4>
by <A HREF="mailto:newt@pobox.com">Greg Roelofs</A>
</A>


<P>
<B>Prehistory</B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Story of PNG actually begins way back in 1977 and 1978 when two Israeli
researchers, Jacob Ziv and Abraham Lempel, first published a pair of papers on
a new class of lossless data-compression algorithms, now collectively referred
to as ``LZ77'' and ``LZ78.''  Some years later, in 1983, Terry Welch of Sperry
(which later merged with Burroughs to form Unisys) developed a very fast
variant of LZ78 called LZW.  Welch also filed for a patent on LZW, as did two
IBM researchers, Victor Miller and Mark Wegman.  The result was...you guessed
it...the USPTO granted both patents (in December 1985 and March 1989,
respectively).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Meanwhile CompuServe--specifically, Bob Berry--was busily designing a new,
portable, compressed image format in 1987.  Its name was GIF, for ``Graphics
Interchange Format,'' and Berry et al. blithely settled on LZW as the
compression method.  Tim Oren, Vice President of Future Technology at
CompuServe (now with Electric Communities), wrote:  ``The LZW algorithm
was incorporated from an open publication, and without knowledge that Unisys
was pursuing a patent.  The patent was brought to our attention, much to our
displeasure, after the GIF spec had been published and passed into wide use.''
There are claims [1] that Unisys was made aware of this as early as 1989 and
chose to ignore the use in ``pure software''; the documents to substantiate
this claim have apparently been lost.  In any case, Unisys for years limited
itself to pursuit of hardware vendors--particularly modem manufacturers
implementing V.42bis in silicon.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
All of that changed at the end of 1994.  Whether due to ongoing financial
difficulties or as part of the industry-wide bonk on the head provided by
the World Wide Web, Unisys in 1993 began aggressively pursuing commercial
vendors of software-only LZW implementations.  CompuServe seems to have 
been its primary target at first, culminating in an agreement--quietly
announced on 28 December 1994, right in the middle of the Christmas
holidays--to begin collecting royalties from authors of GIF-supporting
software.  The spit hit the fan on the Internet the following week; what
was then the comp.graphics newsgroup went nuts, to use a technical term.
As is the way of Usenet, much ire was directed at CompuServe for making
the announcement, and then at Unisys once the details became a little
clearer; but mixed in with the noise was the genesis of an informal Internet
working group led by Thomas Boutell [2].  Its purpose was not only to design a
replacement for the GIF format, but a successor to it:  better, smaller,
more extensible, and FREE.


<P>
<B>The Early Days (All Seven of 'Em)</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The very first PNG draft--then called ``PBF,'' for Portable Bitmap Format--
was posted by Tom to comp.graphics, comp.compression and
comp.infosystems.www.providers on Wednesday, 4 January 1995.  It had a
three-byte signature, chunk numbers rather than chunk names, maximum pixel
depth of 8 bits and no specified compression method, but even at that stage
it had more in common with today's PNG than with any other existing format.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Within one week, most of the major features of PNG had been proposed, if
not yet accepted:  delta-filtering for improved compression (Scott Elliott);
deflate compression (Tom Lane, the Info-ZIP gang and many others); 24-bit
support (many folks); the PNG name itself (Oliver Fromme); internal CRCs
(myself); gamma chunk (Paul Haeberli) and 48- and 64-bit support (Jonathan
Shekter).  The first proto-PNG mailing list was also set up that week; Tom
released the second draft of the specification; and I posted some test results
that showed a 10% improvement in compression if GIF's LZW method was simply
replaced with the deflate (LZ77) algorithm.  Figure 1 is a timeline listing
many of the major events in PNG's history.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Perhaps equally interesting are some of the proposed features and design
suggestions that ultimately were <I>not</I> accepted:  the Amiga IFF format;
uncompressed bitmaps either gzip'd or stored inside zipfiles; thumbnail
../gx/hammel and/or generic multi-image support; little-endian byte order; Unicode
UTF-8 character set for text; YUV and other lossy image-encoding schemes; and
so forth.  Many of these topics produced an amazing amount of discussion--in
fact, the main proponent of the zipfile idea is still making noise two years
later.


<P>
<B>Onward, Frigidity</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One of the real strengths of the PNG group was its ability to weigh the pros
and cons of various issues in a rational manner (well, most of the time,
anyway), reach some sort of consensus and then move on to the next issue 
without prolonging discussion on ``dead'' topics indefinitely.  In part this
was probably due to the fact that the group was relatively small, yet possessed
of a sufficiently broad range of graphics and compression expertise that no
one felt unduly ``shut out'' when a decision went against him.  (All of the
PNG authors were male.  Most of them still are.  I'm sure
there's a dissertation in there somewhere...)  But equally important was Tom
Boutell, who, as the initiating force behind the PNG project, held the role 
of benevolent dictator--much the way Linus Torvalds does with Linux kernel
development.  When consensus was impossible, Tom would make a decision, and
that would settle the matter.  (On one or two rare occasions he might later
have been persuaded to reverse the decision, but this generally only happened
if new information came to light.)

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In any case, the development model worked:  by the beginning of February 1995,
seven drafts had been produced, and the PNG format was settling down.  (The
PNG name was adopted in Draft 5.)  The next month was mainly spent working
out the details:  chunk-naming conventions, CRC size and placement, choice 
of filter types, palette-ordering, specific flavors of transparency and 
alpha-channel support, interlace method, etc.  CompuServe was impressed 
enough by the design that on the 7th of February they announced support for
PNG as the designated successor to GIF, supplanting what they had initially
referred to as the GIF24 development project. [3]  By the beginning of March,
PNG Draft 9 was released and the specification was officially frozen--just 
over two months from its inception.  Although further drafts followed, they 
merely added clarifications, some recommended behaviors for encoders and
decoders, and a tutorial or two.  Indeed, Glenn Randers-Pehrson has kept some
so-called ``paleo PNGs'' that were created at the time of Draft 9; they are
still readable by any PNG decoder today. [4]


<P>
<B>Oy, My Head Hurts</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But specifying a format is one thing; implementing it is quite another.
Although the original intent was to create a "lightweight" format--and,
compared to TIFF or even JPEG, PNG <I>is</I> fairly lightweight--even a 
completely orthogonal feature set can introduce substantial complications.
For example, consider progressive display of an image in a web browser.
First comes straight decoding of the compressed data; no problems there.
Then any line-filtering must be inverted to get the actual image data.
Oops, it's an interlaced image:  now pixels are appearing here and
there within each 8x8 block, so they must be rendered appropriately (and
possibly buffered).  The image also has transparency and is being overlaid
on a background image, adding a bit more complexity.  So far we're not much
worse off than we would be with an interlaced, transparent GIF; the line
filters and 2D interlacing scheme are pretty straightforward extensions to
what programmers have already dealt with.  Even adding gamma correction to
the foreground image isn't too much trouble.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But wait, it's not just simple transparency; we have an alpha channel!  And
we don't want sparse display--we really like the replicating progressive
method Netscape Navigator uses.  Now things are tricky:  each replicated
pixel-block has some percentage of the fat foreground pixel mixed in with
complementary amounts of the background pixels in the block.  And just
because the current fat pixel is 65% transparent (or, even worse, completely
opaque) doesn't mean later ones in the same block will be, too:  thus we have
to remember all of the original background pixel-values until their final 
foreground pixels are composited and overlaid.  Toss in the ability to render
all of this nicely on an 8-bit, colormapped display, and most programmers'
heads will explode.


<P>
<B>Make It So!</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Of course, some of these things are application (presentation or front-end)
issues, not general PNG-decoding (back-end) issues.  Nevertheless, a good 
PNG library should allow for the possibility of such applications--which is
another way of saying that it should be general enough not to place undue 
restrictions on any programmer who wants to implement such things.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Once Draft 9 was released, many people set about writing PNG encoders
and/or decoders.  The true glory is really reserved for three people,
however: Info-ZIP's Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler (both also of gzip fame),
who originally wrote Zip's deflate() and UnZip's inflate() routines and
then, for PNG, rewrote them as a portable library called <I>zlib</I> [5]; and Guy
Eric Schalnat of Group 42, who almost single-handedly wrote the <I>libpng</I>
reference implementation (originally ``pnglib'') from scratch. [6]  The
first truly usable versions of the libraries were released two months after
Draft 9, on the first of May, 1995.  Although both libraries were missing
some features required for full implementation, they were sufficiently
complete to be used in various freeware applications.  (Draft 10 of the
specification was released at the same time, with clarifications resulting
from these first implementations.)


<P>
<B>Fast-Forward to the Present</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The pace of subsequent developments slowed at that point.  This was partly
due to the fact that, after four months of intense development and dozens of
e-mail messages every day, everyone was burned out; partly because Guy
controlled libpng's development and became busy with other things at work;
and partly because of the perception that PNG was basically ``done.''  The
latter point was emphasized by a CompuServe press release to that effect in
mid-June (and one, I might add, in which their PR guys claimed much of the
credit for PNG's development, sigh).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Nevertheless, progress continued.  In June of 1995 I set up the PNG home page,
now grown to roughly a dozen pages [7]; Kevin Mitchell officially registered
the ``PNGf'' Macintosh file ID with Apple Computer.  In August Alexander 
Lehmann and Willem van Schaik released a fine pair of additions to the NetPBM
image-manipulation suite, particularly handy under Linux:  pnmtopng and
pngtopnm version 2.0.  And in December at the Fourth International World Wide
Web Conference, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the PNG
Specification version 0.92 as an official standards-track Working Draft.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
1996 saw the February release of version 0.95 as an Internet Draft by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), followed in July by the Internet
Engineering Steering Group's (IESG) approval of version 1.0 as an official
Informational RFC.  (However, the IETF secretary still hasn't issued the 
actual RFC number at the time of this writing, five months later.  Sigh.)
The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) Architecture Group in early
August adopted PNG as one of the two required image formats for minimal
VRML 2.0 conformance. [8]  Meanwhile the W3C promoted the spec to Proposed
Recommendation status in July and then to full Recommendation status on the
first of October. [9]  Finally, in mid-October the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) formally approved ``image/png'' as an official Internet
Media Type, joining image/gif and image/jpeg as non-experimental image
formats for the Web.  Much of this standardization would not have happened
nearly as quickly without the tireless efforts of Tom Lane and Glenn
Randers-Pehrson, who took over editing duties of the spec from Thomas Boutell.


<P>
<B>Current Status</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So where are we today?  The future is definitely bright for PNG, and the
present isn't looking too bad, either.  I now have over 125 applications
listed [10] with PNG support either current or planned (mostly current); 
among the ones available for Linux are:

<UL>
	<LI>XV (image viewer/converter)
	<LI>ImageMagick (image viewer/converter)
	<LI>GRAV (image viewer)
	<LI>Zgv (image viewer)
	<LI>xli (image viewer)
	<LI>XPaint (image editor)
	<LI>The GIMP (image editor)
	<LI>Image Alchemy (image converter)
	<LI>pnmtopng/pngtopnm (image converters)
	<LI>XEmacs (editor/web browser/operating system/etc.)
	<LI>gforge (fractal terrain generator)
	<LI>Fractint (fractal generator)
	<LI>Ghostscript (PostScript viewer/converter)

	<LI>Mapedit (image-map editor)
	<LI>WWWis (HTML IMG sizer)
	<LI>file(1) (Unix file-type identifier)
</UL>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Discerning readers will note the conspicuous absence of Netscape Navigator.
Despite the fact that Netscape was aware of the PNG project from the 
beginning and unofficially indicated ``probable support''; despite the nice
benefits gamma correction, alpha support and 2D interlacing bring to WWW
applications; despite the fact that the WWW Consortium, of which Netscape is
a member, released the PNG spec as its first official Recommendation; despite
the requirement to support PNG in VRML 2.0 viewers like Netscape's own Live3D
plug-in; and despite considerable pestering by members of the PNG group and
the Internet community at large, Netscape is still only ``considering'' future
support of PNG.  Until Netscape either supports PNG natively or gets swept
away by Microsoft or someone else, PNG's usefulness as an image format for 
the Web is considerably diminished.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
On the other hand, our buds at Microsoft recognized the benefits of PNG and
apparently embraced it wholeheartedly.  They have not only made it the native
image format of the Office97 application suite but have also repeatedly
promised to put it into Internet Explorer (theoretically by the time of the
4.0 betas--we'll see about that).  Assuming they do, Netscape is almost
certain to follow suit.  (See?  Microsoft <I>is</I> good for something!)  At
that point PNG should enjoy a real burst of WWW interest and usage.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the meantime, PNG viewing actually is possible with Linux Netscape; it's
just not very useful.  Rasca Gmelch is working on a Unix plug-in with (among
other things) PNG support.  Although it's still an alpha version and requires
ImageMagick's <B>convert</B> utility to function, that's not the problem; Netscape's
brain-damaged plug-in architecture is.  Plug-ins have no effect on HTML's
IMG tag:  if there's no native support for the image format and no helper
app defined, the image is ignored regardless of whether an installed plug-in
supports it.  Instead you must use Netscape's EMBED extension.  That means
anyone who wants universally viewable web pages loses either way:  PNG with
IMG doesn't work under Netscape, and PNG with EMBED doesn't work under much
of anything except Netscape and MSIE (and those only if the user has installed
a working PNG plug-in).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But support by five or six other Linux web browsers ain't bad, and even
mainstream applications like Adobe's Photoshop now do PNG natively.  More
are showing up every week, too.  Life is good.


<P>
<B>The Future</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As VRML takes off--which it almost certainly will, especially with the 
advent of truly cheap, high-performance 3D accelerators--PNG will go along
for the ride.  (JPEG, which is the other required VRML 2.0 image format,
doesn't support transparency.)  Graphic artists will use PNG as an intermediate
format because of its lossless 24-bit (and up) compression and as a final
format because of its ability to store gamma and chromaticity information for
platform-independence.  Once the ``big-name'' browsers support PNG natively,
users will adopt it as well--for the 2D interlacing method, the cross-platform
gamma correction, and the ability to make anti-aliased balls, buttons, text
and other graphic elements that look good on *any* color background (no more
``ghosting,'' thanks to the alpha-channel support).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Indeed, the only open issue is support for animations and other multi-image
applications.  In retrospect, the principal failure of the PNG group was its
delay in extending PNG to MNG, the "Multi-image Network Graphics" format.
As noted earlier, everyone was pretty burned out by May 1995; in fact, it
was a full year before serious discussion of MNG resumed.  As (bad) luck
would have it, October 1995 is when the first Netscape 2.0 betas arrived
with animation support, giving the (dying?) GIF format a huge resurgence
in popularity.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At the time of this writing (mid-December 1996), the MNG specification has
undergone some 27 drafts--almost entirely written by Glenn Randers-Pehrson--and
is close to being frozen.  A couple of special-purpose MNG implementations have
been written, as well.  But MNG is too late for the VRML 2.0 spec, and despite
some very compelling features, it may never be perceived as anything more than
PNG's response to GIF animations.  Time will tell.


<P>
<B>At Last...</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It's always difficult for an insider to render judgment on a project like
PNG; that old forest-versus-trees thing tends to get in the way of objectivity.
But it seems to me that the PNG story, like that of Linux, represents the
best of the Internet:  international cooperation, rapid development and the
production of a Good Thing that is not only useful but also freely available
for everyone to enjoy.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then again, maybe I'm just a shameless egotist (nyuk nyuk nyuk).  You
decide....

of it is particularly relevant to planetary research.  Go figure.)

<H1>Indexing Texts with Smart</H1>
<H4>By Hans Paijmans
<a href="mailto:paai@kub.nl">paai@kub.nl</a></H4>
</center>
<P> <HR> <P>  

<H2>1. The uses of Linux and MS-DOS</A></H2>
<P>
Although my colleagues here on Tilburg University may think that I
spend my time fiddling with Linux on a PC that could be put to better
uses, they are wrong. The 'fiddling with Linux' I do at home; at my
work I only do the bare minimum necessary to keep Linux fed and happy.
As most readers of this journal know, this involves making the
occasional backup and for the rest: nothing.
<P>
When I sit in front of my PC, I <EM>work</EM> (well, mostly). Linux makes
it possible to do my work with a minimum of fuss and a big part of the
credit for this goes to Jacques Gelinas, the man who wrote Umsdos: a
layer between the Unix operating system and the vanilla MS-DOS 8+3 FAT
system. This makes it possible to access the DOS-partition of my hard
disk from either operating system. This is good news, because I am
totally dependent from two programs: SMART, an indexing and retrieval
system and SPSS for Windows to twiddle the data I obtain form
SMART. SMART only runs under Unix (and not all Unixes for that matter)
and SPSS4Windows, obviously, runs under MS-Windows and whatever the
virtues of this operating system may be, you emphatically do not want
to use it in any kind of experimental environment.
<P>
I suppose that SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) will
be familiar to most Linux users. If not: SPSS is just what it says, a
statistical package but not only for the 'social sciences' but for
about everyone who needs statistical analysis of his data. SMART,
however, is an indexing and retrieval program for text. What is more:
it does not just index the words, it also adds weights to them. It
also allows the user to compare the indexed documents in the so-called
Vector Space Model and to compute the distances between the documents,
or between documents and queries. To understand why this is special we
must delve a bit in the typical problems of Information Retrieval,
i.e. the storage of books, articles etcetera and the retrieval of
those on content.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">1.1 Why indexing is not enough</A></H2>
<P>
When at the end of the sixties automatic indexing of texts became a
viable option many people thought that the problems of information
retrieval were solved. Programs like STAIRS (IBM,1972)
enabled the users to file and rapidly retrieve documents on any word
in the text or on boolean combinations (AND, OR, NOT) of those words
and who could ask for more? Then, in 1985 a famous article was
published by two researchers in the field [<A HREF="#BlairMaron1985">1</A>]. In
this article they reported on the performance of STAIRS in real life
and they showed that the efficiency of STAIRS and similar systems was,
in fact, much lower than assumed. Even experienced users could not obtain a
recall of more than 20-40% of the relevant documents in a database of
100,000 documents, and worse, they were not aware of the fact.<BR>
<P>
The problem with all retrieval systems of this type is that human
language is so fuzzy. There may be as much as a dozen different terms
and words pointing to one and the same object, whereas one word may
have widely different meanings. In Information Retrieval this will
lead to one of two situations. Either you try to obtain a high
precision, when almost all the retrieved documents are relevant (but
an unknown number of other relevant documents are not included) or you
go for high recall, but then a lot of irrelevant documents will be
included in the result. When in a retrieved set of documents the
proportion of irrelevant documents is high, the user will probably
stop looking at the documents before he or she has found all the
relevant ones: in fact his <EM>futility-point</EM> has been reached. In
such a case the net result is equal to the situation in which those
relevant records that would be presented after the user reached that
futility-point were <EM>not</EM> retrieved. Therefore the concept of
ranking, i.e. the ordering of retrieved documents on relevance, is
very important in Information Retrieval.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">2. SMART</A></H2>
<P>
Modern (and not so modern) research has offered a number of possible
solutions to this dilemma. Some of those solutions use the concept of
<EM>weighted</EM> keywords. This means that every keyword-document
combination has a weight attached that (hopefully) is an indication of
the relevance of that particular keyword for that particular
document. SMART does just that: it creates indexes for a database of
documents and attaches weights to them. The way that happens may be
expressed intuitively as <EM>'the more a word occurs in the less
documents, the higher the weight'</EM>. Or, if the word 'dog' occurs
twenty times in a given document, but in no other documents, you may
be relatively certain that this document is about dogs. Information
Retrieval addicts like me talk about the <I>tf</I>.<I>idf</I> weight.
<P>
Smart offers several options as to how that weight should be arrived
at: I generally prefer the so-called atc-variation, because it adjusts
for the length of the individual documents.
<P>
It calculates the <I>tf</I>.<I>idf</I> in three steps. The first step creates the
value  <IMG WIDTH=35 HEIGHT=18 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline96" SRC="../gx/hansp/img1.gif"  >  for the term-frequency (<I>tf</I>) as
<P>
<P> <IMG WIDTH=321 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath86" SRC="../gx/hansp/img2.gif"  > <P>
<P>
where  <IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=18 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline100" SRC="../gx/hansp/img3.gif"  >  is the term with the highest frequency in the
document. This adjusts for the document-length and the number of
terms. Then the weight  <IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=7 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline102" SRC="../gx/hansp/img4.gif"  >  is calculated as
<P>
<P> <IMG WIDTH=313 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath87" SRC="../gx/hansp/img5.gif"  > <P>
<P>
where N is as before the number of documents and <I>F</I> the document
frequency of term <I>t</I> (the number of documents in which term <I>t</I>
occurs). Finally the cosine normalization is applied by
<P>
<P> <IMG WIDTH=318 HEIGHT=35 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath88" SRC="../gx/hansp/img6.gif"  > <P>
<P>
where T is the number of terms in the document vector. Now we have a
number between zero and one that hopefully correlates with the
importance of the word as a keyword for that document.  For a
detailed discussion of these and similar techniques see e.g. Salton
and McGill ([<A HREF="#SaltonMcGill1983">2</A>]). You will love it!
<P>
This is not all. When SMART has constructed the index in one of the
various ways available, it also can retrieve the documents for
you. This is done according to something called ``the Vector Space
Model''. This model is best explained using a three-dimensional
example of a vector-space; you can add another few thousand dimensions
in your own imagination.
<P>
Imagine you want to index your documents according to three keywords
'cat', 'dog' and 'horse'; keywords that may or may not occur in your
documents. So you draw three axes to get a normal three-dimensional
coordinate system. One dimension can be used to indicate the
``cat-ness'' of every document, the other its ``dog-ness'' and the
third the ``lion-ness''. To make things easy we only use binary values
0 and 1, although SMART can cope with floats (the 'weights' mentioned
before. So if a document is about cats, it scores a one on the
corresponding axis, otherwise it scores a zero. Any document may now
be drawn in that space according to the occurrence of one or more of
the keywords and now we have a relatively easy way to compute the
difference between those document. Moreover a query consisting of
one or more of the keywords can be drawn in the same space and the
documents can be ranked according to the distance to that query. Of
course a typical document database has thousands of keywords and
accordingly thousands of dimensions, but the arithmetics involved in
multi-dimensional distances do not matter much to modern computers,
and if they bother <EM>you</EM>, you just have to smoke something illegal
and matters will rapidly become clear. If only till the next morning.
<P>
So SMART accepts queries, ranks the documents according to the
``nearness'' to that query and return them to you in that
order. Therefore it is still one of the best retrieval systems that
are ever written although it lacks the bells and whistles of its more
expensive counterparts in some operating systems I could mention. And
although it is not really optimized for speed, it runs typically 10-30
times faster than the fastest indexing program I ever saw under
MS-Windows.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">3. The DOS connection</A></H2>
<P>
But I am not using SMART for bread-and-butter retrieval, but for the
weights it computes and the indexes it creates. At this point I want
to do some other manipulations of these data and again I have to offer
my thanks to the developers of unix in general and to Linux in
particular. A whole string of ever more complicated and sophisticated
shell scripts, the standard unix tools and a few of My Very Own
utilities suffice to process the SMART output to a file that is ready
for importing in SPSS.
<P>
Nevertheless now I have to quit Linux and boot MS-DOS, start
MS-Windows and finally enter SPSS to do the statistics and create some
graphs. I am a newcomer to Unix (indeed it was the fact that Linux
offered a way to use SMART that pulled me over the line two years
ago), but already I am wondering how people can live in the stifling
atmosphere of MS-Windows. The fact that you can't really run two
applications at the same time is not even the worst thing. But who is
responsible for the idea that Icons and Popups were better and more
efficient than the plain old command line? And what happened to pipes
and filters? And a sensible command language? Be that as it may, SPSS
gets the job done and when the output is written to disk I immediately
escape back to Linux to write the final article, report or whatever
with LaTeX.<BR>
<P>


<H2><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">4. The bad news</A></H2>
<P>
On this point I have two messages: one is good, the other bad. I'll
start with the good news. SMART is obtainable by anonymous ftp from
Cornell University and may be used for free for scientific and
experimental purposes. Better yet: it compiles under Linux without
much tweaking and twiddling. Also there exists a fairly active
mailing list for people who use SMART (smart-peoplecs.cornell.edu).<BR> 
<BR>
<P>
The bad news: the manual. What manual? SMART is not for the faint of
heart; after unpacking and compilation you'll find some extremely
obscure notes and examples and that is it. Nevertheless, if you have
more than just a few megabytes of text to manage AND the stamina to
learn SMART, it certainly is the best solution for your information
retrieval needs. But don't I wish somebody would write a comprehensive
manual! In the meantime you may perhaps be helped by my ``tutorial for
newbees'', to be found at
http://pi0959.kub.nl:2080/Paai/Onderw/Smart/hands.html.<BR> <BR>

<P><A NAME="txtunix"></A><B>Generally about UNIX text editors</B> </P>

<P>All of my friends who use Linux always told me that text editors is
very important problem under this OS (I mean text-mode editors with 100K
executable for writing programs).
As I understand, this problem is not a problem of Linux itself,
but it's a problem of every UNIX. What's more I know which reasons cause
this trouble. There is two reasons: <TT>putc</TT> output to screen and
<TT>getc</TT> input from keyboard. In other OS-es user (programmer) can
catch <TT>Alt+&lt;letter&gt;</TT> or <TT>Shift+&lt;letter&gt;</TT> keystrokes
and use it as a commands of editor. In UNIX user has only 256 ASCII-codes
avialable (really, much less than 256) and because of it every UNIX editor
uses either very long sequences of keystrokes as editing commands (as emacs
or joe) or it has two editing modes (command mode and typing mode in VI
for example). On X-s everything is better, because here we can get scan
code (not real scan, but this code is anough for all my needs)
of the key pressed and status of Shift-keys (Alt, Caps, Shift, Ctrl
and mouse buttons), so we can use functional keys, arrow-keys and everything
else You can find on Your keyboard (everybody knows how to do that).
</P>

<P>But even with text mode editors under Linux everything is not so bad:
You can switch keyboard to <A HREF="#Cex">RAW mode</A>
and do with it all You want (don't
forget to get another console from which You will execute <TT>shutdown
-r now</TT> command during beta-testing Your program). But it's very important
to understand that RAW-keyboard programs will not work through telnet.
Also is very important to set <TT>SIGSEGV</TT> and <TT>SIGKILL</TT> signal
handlers so that they'll switch keyboard back to normal mode from RAW when
something happens.
Once I heard about kernel patching so that You can use <TT>ScrollLock</TT>
key to switch between raw and normal mode, but I don't know how to apply
this patch. </P>

<P>
<HR>

<P><A NAME="myreq"></A><B>What I'd like to have in text editor</B> </P>

<P><i>Caution :</i> This section is very private. Maybe someone will find something useful
for him(here) here, but probably not. This section is mostly about my own
text editor, so, if You got used to Turbo-Vision-like editors and You're
satisfied, then probably You will find the follwing not interesting. So
don't read it, don't waste Your time.</P>

<OL>
<B><LI></b>Editor must be the same on every operating system 
(multi-platform).


<P><B><LI></B>Editor must handle advanced search feature: I need not only
case sensetive/insensetive search, but as a minimum a wildcard searh or
regular expressions search (this type of search includes wildcards). 

<P><B><LI></B>Editor must support projects: user must be able to create
a list of files (sources of some program) and walk through these files
freely (enter into file, quit from file, switch to another file, ...).
The possible solution is to assign some keystroke as an &quot;enter-into-file&quot;
command, and then, when user invokes &quot;enter-into-file&quot;, open
a file with a name similar to the word under cursor (For example, you can
enter in h-file from the text of c-program; just move cursor to the #include
&quot;...&quot; statement and press the &quot;enter-into-file&quot; key).


<P><B><LI></B>Editor must handle many files opened at the same time so
that user can freely move from one text to another (very often I need to
read declarations of functions in <TT>.h</TT> files) 

<P><B><LI></B>Editor must support compiling, make etc. from within text
editor (generally: execution OS command from within editor) 

<P><B><LI></B>Commands must be rather simultaneous pressings of a few keys
than sequences of keystrokes. It seems to me, it isn't comfortable to type
(F10, 'F', 'O' , <TT>filename</TT>) every time You need to open a new file.
Besides, with such a keyboard layout it's impossible to work fast. This
requirement causes a problem: text editor cannot work through telnet, because
telnet protocol transfers only ASCII-codes, but not scan-codes. 

<P><B><LI></B>Text editor must consider a text not as a sequence of chars
but as a sequence of lines, where each line is a sequence of chars. There
is a lot of text editors in which text is a vector (For example ME (MSDOS
MultiEdit) , Turbo Editor (Borland Programming Environments), JOE (linux),
etc.), But I don't know how to work with tables in these editors or how
to set <TT>//</TT> (C++ comment) at the beginning of 10 lines of program
on the screen.

<P><B><LI></B>Editor must support macrocommands as a recordable sequences
of keystrokes. 

<P><B><LI></B>If editor supports programming language, so that I can write
my own commands, it would be fine. 

<P><B><LI></B>I think programs-structurizing is very useful feature.
    I'll explain: I'd like to have text of my program in pre-hypertext
    form so that I see a list of functions on the screen, I put cursor
    on  the name of desired function, press "open"-key and now I can
    edit source of that function, but besides that I must be able
    to edit this file with usual text editor and I must be able
    to compile that file without errors, hence all additional info
    about hypertext structure of program must be placed into comments
    (comments are specific for each file type, but in most cases
    it depends on file extension).


<P><B><LI></B>Keyboard layout must be as much tunable as possible (if
my <TT>End</TT> key is broken, I can use <TT>F11</TT> key instead). Besides
I often need keyboard layout for second language (cyrillic). 


<P><B><LI></B>I don't like when editor wastes screen space on frames of
windows or any other unuseful things (80 * 25 isn't very roomy) 

<P><B><LI></B>Font on the screen must be fixed (I hate proportional fonts).

</ol>

<P>
If You're interested in all that, You can try our example of such a text editor.
I think it isn't the best editor, but I got used to it. May It will be useful for
someone. To get it, go to

<center><h1>Two New X-windows Mail Clients</h1></center>

<center><h4><a href="mailto: layers@vax2.rain.gen.mo.us">by Larry
Ayers</a></h4></center>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>There are several full-featured text-mode mail clients available for Linux,
and these programs (such as Pine and Elm) are probably the most commonly used
mailers in the Linux/unix world.  One reason for this tendency is that they
run equally well in both console and X sessions (in an xterm).  They also have
a longer development history than their X-windows counterparts which results
in the accretion of more features and options. There has been ample time for
the developers to deal with bugs as well.

<p>Many of the X-windows mailers I've tried have either been too basic, too
beta, or awkward to use.  I've always returned to Pine, my standby.  Recently
two X-based mailers have been released (in late beta versions), both of which
are stable and well-provided with features and options.  When I say stable I
mean that they have functioned well for me, I haven't lost any mail, and
they both have been through several releases in which the most egregious
bugs seem to have been ironed out.

<p>Mail programs are a rather personal sort of software.  I've found it to be
prudent to copy any existing mailbox files or directories to a safe location
before installing any new mail client.  You never know until you try just what
a new mailer will do with your existing mail messages the first time it is
run.  As an example, mbox-style mail "folders" (which are just single files
with messages concatenated) might be willy-nilly transformed into MH-style
directories, with each message becoming an individual numbered file.  I
suppose there may exist a technique to reverse this metamorphosis, but I don't
know what it might be, aside from manually using an editor.

<center><h3>TkMail</h3></center>

<p><a href="mailto: raines@slac.stanford.edu">Paul Raines</a> has been working
on a Tcl/Tk mail client for some time now.  I'll let him describe its
origin:<br>

<pre><i>

   I began the project at the beginning of '92 while a physics
  grad student at the Univ. of Penn.  I had been put in charge
  of several SGI workstations and was disappointed in the X
  window mail readers I had found. I had recently got into
  Tcl/Tk programming and played around with putting Tk
  interfaces on top of command line programs for physics
  simulation.  I figured it would be easy to do one to sit on
  top of the mailx command and did. That produced tkmail 1.x.
  Eventually I decided I was too limited by the mailx command
  and wrote a Perl backend to serve as an extensible
  equivalent. That produced tkmail 2.x.  Perl was used because
  its text processing features were much faster than Tcl but I
  wanted to keep the whole program as scripts for portability.
  This proved a lost cause as Perl proved as hard to port as C
  code.  For my update to work with Tk4.0, I decided to drop
  Perl in favor of writing my own C code as a module extension
  to Tcl. The past year was the last of my graduate career and
  mostly devoted to finishing my thesis leaving little time
  for work on tkmail. It is sort of behind in some of the
  features out there today (MIME, POP, IMAP, etc) but I hope
  to rectify that soon.

            The most important future plans are: 

                   * better MIME support

                   * better key binding customization 
                    
                   * an "auto-filing" feature

                   * better search support </i></pre> <br>

<p>TkMail is very customizable; Paul Raines includes with the distribution an
alternate Tk text-manipulation library which allows the use of emacs-style
key-bindings in the compose window. This library can be used with other Tk
programs as well. Colors and fonts can be independently selected for the
folder-view and compose window.  Much of the configuration can be done from
menu-selections.

<p>Here is a screenshot of the main folder-view window:<br>

<p><center><a href="../gx/ayers/main.gif">Tkmail Main Window</a></center>

<p>And here is one of the composition window:<br>

<p><center><a href="../gx/ayers/comp.gif">the Composition Window</a></center>

<p>TkMail, like many other Linux mailers, in effect acts as a front-end to
sendmail. Luckily most recent Linux distributions come with sendmail
preconfigured. If your inbox is on a POP server you will need to use
popclient, fetchmail, or fetchpop to retrieve your messages and leave them in
a mailbox file on your local disk, where mail clients can find them.

<p>Among the many features of this beta release are:<br>

<ul>
  <li>easy inclusion of files into message compositions with
      automatic uuencoding and compression, if desired
  <li>ability to access an alternate editor from the composition window
  <li>spell check compositions using an X windows interface (using ispell)
  <li>reads aliases from either standard .mailrc or elm aliases.txt
  <li>sorting of messages on any field and the ability to
      write out the folder physically in that order
  <li>simple MIME reading and composition tool
  <li>built in 'biff' icon for notification of new mail
      on multiple folders
  <li>dynamic (at startup) menus for quick access to mail folders
      for reading, copying, and moving messages
</ul><br>

<p>TkMail is set up initially to open a small debugging window from which the
main program can be started.  Once it becomes evident that the program is
working to your satisfaction this can be disabled by editing the main
<b>tkmail4</b> script and changing the line <i>set mfp(debug) 1</i> to <i>set
mfp(debug) 0</i>, or just start it with the <i>-nodebug</i> option.

<p>I have found TkMail 4.0b8 to be easy to learn and use, and its interface is
nice-looking. With a little more work on the MIME abilities it will be as
effective an X mail client as any available.

<p>Paul Raines maintains a
<a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~raines/tkmail.html">home page</a> for
TkMail; the source for the 4.0b8 version is available
<a href="ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/TkMail/BETA/">here</a>.

<center><h3>XFMail</h3></center>

<p>Some months ago John Fisk wrote about the XFmail program in the Gazette.
His account inspired me to try it out, but I had quite a few problems with the
message editing window, so much so that when I tried to mail the developers a
comment on their program, the message was corrupted and I doubt that it was
legible to them.  I gave up and deleted it soon after, making a mental note
to check it out later when perhaps it had become more usable.

<p>Recently I did just that, and found that a new editing module had been
contributed which really makes a difference in usage of the mailer.  No longer
is there a limit to the amount of the text in the editing window.  This
change, I believe, makes XFMail a credible choice as a Linux mail client.

<p>XFMail requires the XForms library.  This is available from 
<a href="http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xform">the XForms web-site</a>, which will
always have the latest version and news.  If you obtain the archive be aware
that the package includes a GUI designer as well as many samples.  All you
need to keep if you're not a programmer is the XForms shared and static
libraries (libforms.so.81 and libforms.a) and the header file (forms.h). These
three files will enable you to compile XForms applications, such as XFMail
from source.

<p>In order to try the current beta (which I recommend) you'll need to obtain
the source archive from the
<a href="ftp://Burka.NetVision.net.il/pub/xfmail/work/">
XFMail home FTP site</a>.
As long as you have the XForms library files installed it should compile for
you, notwithstanding the warning message at the FTP site.  If your current
mailbox is in the common mailx format (a single file), you might want to copy
the file (INBOX or whatever) to another location before installing XFMail.
The default behaviour is for XFMail to transform your messages into the
multiple-file MH format; after installation you can disable this and move your
mailbox back.  If you already store your mail in the MH manner the program
will load your messages without moving them.

<p>Even though XFMail reads and stores messages in MH format, it doesn't
require that you have the MH system installed.

<p>This mail client can handle all mail fetching and delivery needs for a
single-user machine.  The user is given the option of using sendmail for
delivery (either on- or off-line), or using XFMail to directly contact the
SMPT server and deliver outgoing mail.  Fetching new mail can be done
externally,(popclient et al), or via XFMail directly.  These features could be
helpful for new users who would rather not deal with sendmail; all functions
can be handled by the mailer.

<p>XFMail has the recognizable XForms look, familiar to users of the Lyx
front-end program for TeX/Latex.  The XForms library gives programs a unique
look, unlike standard X or Motif.  The user interface is perhaps not quite as
fancy as some, but it's not hard to become accustomed to it.  There are some
limitations in choice of colors; the selection available is greater than that
of console-ANSI programs, but less than the amount available to standard X
clients.

<p>Here are some screenshots of the various XFMail windows:<br>

<p><center><a href="../gx/ayers/xf_main.gif">The Main Window</a></center><br>

<center><a href="../gx/ayers/xf_comp.gif">The Composition Window</a></center><br>

<p>And here is the logging window:<br>

<p align=center> <img src="../gx/ayers/xf_log.gif"></p><br>

<p>Among the other features of this mailer are an internal address book, full
MIME support, and support for faces and picons.  Support is planned for
compatibility with mailx-style mail-folders.

<p>XFMail is quite an ambitious programming project; if you do try out the
beta version I'm sure the authors would appreciate hearing any comments you
may have.  There also exists an XFMail mailing list; send a message to:
<a href="mailto:majordomo@Burka.NetVision.net.il">
majordomo@Burka.NetVision.net.il</a>
with "subscribe xfmail" in the message body.

<p>Visit <a href="http://burka.netvision.net.il/xfmail/xfmail.html"
>the XFMail homepage</a> for the latest news; by the time you read this, beta
0.5 may well have been released.

<p>XFMail is being developed by <a href="mailto:gen@NetVision.net.il">
Gennady B. Sorokopud</a> and <a href="mailto:ugen@NetVision.net.il">
Ugen J.S. Antsilevich</a>.

<center><h3>Fun with Little Shell-Scripts</h3></center>

<p>After typing the same command or editing the same rc-file for
the dozenth time the idea of a short executable shell-script
will gradually rise to the surface of my mind. As an example,
last year after much trial-and error I figured out how to start
my S3 X-server in 16-bit mode.  This was great, but I found that
there were a few programs which preferred to be run in 8-bit
mode. Typing <i>startx -- -bpp 16</i> and <i>startx -- -bpp 8</i>
began to become tiresome; then it dawned on me that I could
write a shell script for each color-depth which would do the
typing for me. One of them looks like this:<br><pre>

	#!/bin/sh
	# x16: starts x in 16-bit mode
	startx -- -bpp 16
</pre>

<p>Just a simple little script (made executable with
<i>chmod +x x16</i>) but so handy! 

<p>Encouraged by this, it occurred to me that changing
window-managers could be done in a similar way.  I normally use
fvwm2, but lately I've been fooling around with one of fvwm's
hacked offspring, the Afterstep window-manager. Since I didn't
have Afterstep's configuration quite as usefully customised as
my mainstay fvwm2's, I didn't want to use it the majority of the
time.  Rather than editing ~/.xinitrc each time I wanted to
switch to Afterstep, then again to switch back, I copied
~/.xinitrc twice. The first copy is .xinitrc-f and it's just my
normal copy. The second, .xinitrc-a starts Afterstep instead.
The scripts which control this are as follows:<br><pre>

	#!/bin/sh
	# xa: starts x with afterstep
	cp ~/.xinitrc-a ~/.xinitrc ; startx 
</pre>
<p>and<br><pre>

	#!/bin/sh
	# xf: starts x with fvwm2
	cp ~/.xinitrc-f ~/.xinitrc ; startx
</pre>

<p>Of course, while in an X-session another window-manager can be
easily started from a menu.  I spend a fair amount of time
working in a console session without X running, in which case
the above scripts are useful.

<p>It just occurred to me as I write this that these tasks could
be as easily done using aliases or functions in ~/.bashrc. The
only difference I suppose would be that shell-functions are
memory-resident whereas the scripts aren't.

<p>These examples may seem self-evident or trivial to the
unix-gurus out there, but they were part of the learning process
for me. Perhaps this piece will encourage the beginners out
there to try some similar scripting.

<hr>

<center><h3>Keyboards and RXVT</h3></center>

<p>  Here's a discovery I made recently concerning rxvt, the
memory-saving alternative to xterm.  I received an email message
recently in response to my article last month concerning S-lang
applications, in which I opinionated about rxvt vs. xterm.  The
poster of the message wondered whether there is any way to use
shift-page-up and shift-page-down to scroll the rxvt window,
similar to the way console screens (and xterms) scroll.  I had
tried to get this to work without success, and some usenet
messages had led me to believe that without patching the source
rxvt just wouldn't scroll from the keyboard.

<p>Recently I installed the S.u.S.E. distribution, but didn't
install the supplied rxvt package.  I recompiled rxvt version
2.19 in this new environment, and to my surprise the
above-mentioned scrolling keys worked!  This piqued my
curiosity, so I began prowling through the directory hierarchy
searching for the difference in config files which made this
behaviour possible.  I came up with two differences: first,
there was a new entry in the ~/.Xmodmap file.  The lines<br><pre> 

           keycode 64 = Meta_L
	   keycode 0x6D = Multi_key
</pre>	   
<p>had been added to the "keycode 22 = BackSpace" line which I had
in my previous installation. Second, the /etc/termcap file was
different than the ones I'd seen before; a new rxvt stanza had
been included which looks like this:<br><pre>

rxvt|rxvt terminal emulator:\
	:am:km:mi:ms:xn:xo:\
	:co#80:it#8:li#65:\
	:AL=\E[%dL:DC=\E[%dP:DL=\E[%dM:DO=\E[%dB:IC=\E[%d@:\
	:LE=\E[%dD:RI=\E[%dC:UP=\E[%dA:ae=^O:al=\E[L:as=^N:bl=^G:\
	:cd=\E[J:ce=\E[K:cl=\E[H\E[2J:cm=\E[%i%d;%dH:cr=^M:\
	:cs=\E[%i%d;%dr:ct=\E[3k:dc=\E[P:dl=\E[M:do=^J:ei=\E[4l:\
	:ho=\E[H:ic=\E[@:im=\E[4h:\
	:is=\E[r\E[m\E[2J\E[H\E[?7h\E[?1;3;4;6l\E[4l:\
	:k1=\E[11~:k2=\E[12~:k3=\E[13~:k4=\E[14~:k5=\E[15~:\
	:k6=\E[17~:k7=\E[18~:k8=\E[19~:k9=\E[20~:kI=\E[2~:\
	:kN=\E[6~:kP=\E[5~:kb=\177:kd=\EOB:ke=\E[?1l\E>:kh=\E[H:\
	:kl=\EOD:kr=\EOC:ks=\E[?1h\E=:ku=\EOA:le=^H:md=\E[1m:\
	:me=\E[m:mr=\E[7m:nd=\E[C:rc=\E8:sc=\E7:se=\E[m:sf=^J:\
	:so=\E[7m:sr=\EM:ta=^I:te=\E[2J\E[?47l\E8:ti=\E7\E[?47h:\
	:ue=\E[m:up=\E[A:us=\E[4m:
</pre>

<p>I have noticed, though, that if I type the command
<i>echo $TERM</i> in an rxvt window the result is <i>xterm-color</i>, so
perhaps the above rxvt termcap entry isn't being used at all.

<p>I'd love to know if anyone else has any luck transplanting
either or both of these two changes into their system.  The rxvt
termcap entry can be pasted right into your /etc/termcap file; in
mine it is right after the xterm stanzas. I don't believe the
order of stanzas is important, though.

<hr>

<center><h3>Partitions and Directories</h3></center>

<p>After using linux for a while you tend to take for granted the
supple flexibility inherent in the Linux manner of dealing with
files, partitions, and mount-points.  Recently I began to feel
constrained by a relatively small /usr partition, so I thought
I'd do some experimenting.

<p>I happened to have an unused 100 mb. partition on my disk, so
I created an ext-2 filesystem on it and mounted it on an empty
directory, /new, created for this purpose. Then I ran this
command: cp -a /usr/X11R6 /new. Using cp with the -a switch is
really handy, as it copies all subdirectories, links, and files,
and also saves permissions.

 <p>The next step was modifying the /etc/fstab file, inserting the
following entry which causes /usr/X11R6 to be mounted on the new
partition:<br><pre>

         /dev/hda11     /usr/X11R6   ext2     defaults   1   2
</pre>
<p>Before rebooting I dropped back to a console and deleted the
entire contents of the /usr/X11R6 directory.

<p>I was reasonably certain this would work, but I must confess I
was surprised when (after rebooting) X started up without
comment, as if nothing had changed.

<p>Linux doesn't really care, after all, where files are located,
as long as there is a congruence between the partition table and
the contents of the /etc/fstab file.  One benefit of this laxity
is that repartitioning (with all of the attendant backing up,
restoring, etc.) should seldom be necessary.

<h2>Petition to Cancel Filed Against Linux Trademark</h2>
</center>

<p>Members of the LINUX community have been up in arms during
the past six months over the efforts of an individual named William
R. Della Croce, Jr. from the Boston area to collect 10% royalties on
sales from businesses marketing Linux products.  He bases his written
demands on a US trademark which he claims to hold on the name
"LINUX" for a computer operating system.  He, in fact, holds such a
registered trademark, based on his claim made under penalty of
perjury that he is the owner and first user of the mark for operating
systems, and that he was not aware in 1994 or 1995 of any other
person who might claim or be using this name and mark for an
operating system.  This claim is absurd on its face.

<p>WorkGroup Solutions, Yggdrasil Computing, Linux International,
SSC/<I>Linux Journal</I>, and Linus
Torvalds have retained an internationally known software industry
attorney, G. Gervaise Davis III, of the Davis & Schroeder law firm
in Monterey, CA to seek cancelation of this registration on the
grounds that it is fraudulent and obtained under false pretenses. Mr. 
Davis and his firm are handling the case on a vastly reduced fee 
basis, because of their long standing relationship with the U.S. 
software industry.  Davis was the original attorney for Gary Kildall 
and Digital Research of CP/M fame in the 1980s.

<p>A Petition to Cancel was in fact filed with the Trademark Trial and
Appeals Board in Washington, DC. on November 27, 1996, detailing the
improper actions of Della Croce and setting out the true facts with
a number of exhibits and attachments.  Mr. Davis advises us that we
can expect to have further steps taken by TTAB, under their complex
procedural rules over the next few months.  TTAB will first notify
Della Croce of the filing and permit him time to respond, then
evidence can be collected and depositions taken, and then the
parties can file briefs and other responses.  Often these cases take
more than a  year to be resolved by a TTAB decision.

<p>All of our industry is fully aware that Linus Torvalds developed 
Linux and that it has become one of the world's most popular 
operating systems during the past six years. The participants in this 
proceeding expect the TTAB to cancel the registration, after hearing 
and seeing the massive evidence demonstrating that Della Croce had no 
conceivable legal basis for his claim to the mark.

<p>The petition itself is available <a href="petition.html">here</a> and on 
the websites of each of the petitioners and Mr. Davis' law firm at 
<a href="http://www.iplawyers.com">www.iplawyers.com</a>.  
We urge that interested persons read it, and 
distribute it and this message to all members of the LINUX community 
so that they will be aware of what is being done about this 
outrageous trademark claim.  We will try to keep everyone posted on 
developments in the case through user groups and webpages.

<p>We will continue to keep you updated on the happenings in this action.

<H2>SLEW: Space Low Early Warning</H2>
<H4>By James T. Dennis
<a href="mailto:jim@starshine.org">jim@starshine.org</a></H4>
</center>
<P> <HR> <P>  

<p>One of the worst things you can do to your linux or other
Unix-like system is to allow any of the filesystems to get full.

<p>System performance and stability will suffer noticeable degradation
when you pass about 95% and programs will begin failing and dying
at %100 percent.  Processes that are run as 'root' (like sendmail
and syslog) will actually fill their filesystem past 100% since the
kernel will allocate some of the reserved space for them.

<p>(Yes, you read that right -- when you format  a file system a 
bit of space is reserved for root's exclusive use -- read the 
mke2fs, e2fsck, tune2fs for more on that).

<p>Considering the importance of this issue you might think that our
sophisticated distributions would come with a pre-configured way
to warn you long before there was a real problem.  

<p>Sadly this is one of those things that is "too easy" to bother
with.  Any professional Unix developer, system administrator
or consultant would estimate a total time for writing, installing
and testing such an application at about 15 minutes (I took my 
time and spent an hour on it).  

<p>Here's the script:

<pre>

	#! /bin/bash
		## SLEW: Space Low Early Warning
		## 	by James T. Dennis, 
		##	Starshine Technical Services
		##	
		## Warns if any filesystem in df's output
		## is over a certain percentage full --
		## mails a short report -- listing just 
		## "full" filesystem.
		## Additions can be made to specify
		## *which* host is affected for 
		## admins that manage multiple hosts

	adminmail="root"
		## who to mail the report to


	threshold=${1:?"Specify a numeric argument"}
		## a percentage -- *just the digits*

	# first catch the output in a variable
	fsstat=`/bin/df`

	echo "$fsstat" \
		| gawk '$5 + 0 > '$threshold' {exit 1}'  \
	   || echo "$fsstat" \
		| { echo -e "\n\n\t Warning: some of your" \
			"filesystems are almost full \n\n" ;
			gawk  '$5 + 0 > '${threshold}' + 0 { print $NF, $5, $4 }' } \
		| /bin/mail -s "SLEW Alert" $adminmail

	exit


</pre>
That's twelve lines of code and a mess of comments
(counting each of the "continued" lines as a separate line).

<p>Here's my crontab entry:

<pre>
	## jtd: antares /etc/crontab
	## SLEW: Space Low Early Warning
	## 	Warn me of any filesystems that fill past 90%
	30 1 * * * nobody /root/bin/slew 90
</pre>

<p>Note that the only parameter is a 1 to 3 digit percentage.
slew will silently fail (ignore without error) any parameter(s)
that don't "look like" numbers to gawk.

<p>Here's some typical output from the 'df' command:

<pre>
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/sda5              96136   25684    65488     28%   /
/dev/sda6              32695      93    30914      0%   /tmp
/dev/sda10            485747  353709   106951     77%   /usr
/dev/sda7              48563   39150     6905     85%   /var
/dev/sda8              96152    1886    89301      2%   /var/log
/dev/sda9             254736  218333    23246     90%   /var/spool
/dev/sdb5             510443  229519   254557     47%   /usr/local
</pre>

<p>Note that I will be getting a message from slew tomorrow if
my news expire doesn't clean off some space on /var/spool.  The 
rest of my filesystems are fine.

<p>Obviously you can set the cron job to run more or less often
and at any time you like -- this script takes almost no time
memory or resources.

<p>The message generated can be easily modified -- just 
add more "continuation" lines after the 'echo -e' command
like:

<pre>

	   || echo "$fsstat" \
		| { echo -e "\n\n\t Warning: some of your" \
			"filesystems are almost full \n\n" \
			"You should add your custom text here.\n"\
			"Don't forget to move the ';' semicolon "\
			"and don't put whitespace\n" \
			"after the backslash at the ends of these lines\n\n";

</pre>
Note how the first echo feeds into the grouping (enclosed by the 
braces) so that the contents of $fsstat are appended after the message.
This is a trick that might not work under other shells.

<p>Also, if you plan on writing similar shell scripts,  note that the double 
quotes around the variable names (like "$fsstat") preserve the linefeeds in
their values.  If you leave the quotes out your text will look ugly.

<p>The obvious limitation to this script is that you can only specify one
threshold value for all of the file systems.  While it would be possible
(and probably quite easy) to do this some other way -- it  doesn't matter to 
90% of us.  I suspect that almost anyone who does install this script will set
the threshold to 85, 90 or 95 and forget about it.

<p>One could also extend this script to do some groping (using various 
complex find commands) to list things like: 

<ul>

<li>	Who is the biggest disk hog (which user is taking up all the space
	and what are his or her largest files)?

<p>
<li>	What are the oldest, least accessed files on that filesystem? 
	
<p>	This last question could be answered using something like 
<pre>
	
		'find -xdev -printf "%A@" | sort -n | head' --

</pre>
	which reads something like "find all the links on this filesystem
	and print time that they were last access (expressed as seconds
	since 1970) and their filenames; sort that and just give me a 
	few of the ones from the top of the sorted list."  As you can 
	see, find commands can get very complex very quickly.

</ul>

<p>I chose to keep this script very simple and will develope specific scripts
to suggest file migrations and deletions as needed.

<p>As you can see it is possible to do quite a bit in Linux/Unix using
high level tools and very terse commands.  Certainly the hardest part
of writing a script like this is figuring out minor details about quoting
and syntax (when to enclose blocks in braces or parentheses) and in
determining how to massage the text that's flowing through your pipes.

<p>The first time I wrote slew was while standing in a bookstore a couple of
years ago.  A woman near me was perusing Unix books in my favorite section 
of the store and I asked if I could help her find something in particular.  
She described the problem as it was presented to her in a job interview.
I suggested a 'df | grep && df | mail' type of approach and later, at 
home, fleshed it in and got it working.

<p>Over the years I lost the original (which was a one-liner) and eventually
had one of the systems I was working with hiccup.  That made me re-write
this.  I've left it on all of my systems ever since.

<p>I'd like to encourage anyone who developes or maintains a distribution
(Linux, FreeBSD, or whatever) to add this or something like it to the 
default configuration on your systems.  Naturally it is free for any use
(it's too trivial to copyright in my personal opinion; so, that there is 
no doubt, I hereby place SLEW (comments and code) into the public domain).

up strange readings from that unexplained phenomenon over there.''
Greg's job description is appropriately schizoid, given his interest in far
too many things for his own good.
He's a full-time researcher in multimedia/image-compression/WWW stuff 
at <A HREF="greg_philips.html">Philips Research at 
Palo Alto</A>, having made the switch from Unix system administrator in August
1995. He likes to fancy himself a 
<A HREF="greg_software.html">software developer</A>; among other things, he has
been a member of the <A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/">Info-ZIP</A>
team for six years and the principal author of 
<A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/UnZip.html"><B>UnZip</B></A> for
most of that time. (He's also a member of the <B>Portable Network Graphics</B>
Development Group and the maintainer of the 
<A HREF="http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/PNG/">PNG</A> and 
<A HREF="http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/zlib/">zlib</A> home pages.)
As for recreational interests, he likes to amuse himself by cycling
(often to work); skiing--any flavor, although snow preferred, especially
if it means he can drive in it; scuba diving--for 18 years now, from the 
shores of Lake Superior to the coast of Venezuela to the kelp beds of 
Monterey; and hiking/backpacking, particularly in the Sierra Nevada range;
and <A HREF="greg_photos.html" >amateur photographer</A>.

<img src="../gx/snow.gif" alt="" align=right>
I'd like to apologize for being later than usual getting
<i>LG</i> posted. The weather in Seattle has been a more than a little bizarre
lately. My
neighborhood got about 20 inches of snow from December 26 to December 29.
Since the normal yearly snowfall is about 4 inches, everything stopped,
including the buses for the first time in Metro history. SSC had a portion
of the roof give way under the weight of snow and water (the rains started
December 29 and haven't quit yet). As a result of the flooding, things are
in quite a mess around the office. Yearly rainfall in Seattle is usually 31
inches; this year we had 55 inches. I thought I was back in Houston!
<P> 
Actually, I was back in Houston during my vacation week before Christmas.
The weather wasn't
great there either -- rainy and cold, and I was counting on sunshine. However,
I still had a good time visiting with family and friends. My grandchildren, Sarah
and Rebecca, are a delight to be with -- I miss them a lot. 
<P> 
Have fun!
