<H2>Welcome to Linux Gazette!</H2>

<P><I>Linux Gazette</I> is an on-line WWW publication, and a member of
the Linux Documentation Project, that is dedicated to two simple ideas:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Making Linux just a <I>little</I> more fun </LI>

<LI>Sharing ideas and discoveries </LI>
</UL>

<P>The basic idea behind these two concepts is that Linux is one cool OS,
whose price for admission is a willingness to read, learn, tinker (aka,
<I>hack!</I>), and then share your experiences. The Gazette is a compilation
of basic tips, tricks, suggestions, ideas and short articles about Linux
designed to make using Linux fun and easy. It started out as a personal
project of John M. Fisk, but has grown to include contributions freely
provided by a growing number of authors. <I>Linux Journal</I> is now publishing
the Gazette using material sent to us by outside authors <A HREF="../gx/authors.html">(note
to potential authors)</A>. Without these authors there would not be a Gazette,
and I thank them all. Drop a note to the author of anything that you find
helpful or instructive--the author's e-mail address is included for this
very purpose. </P>

<P><I>Linux Gazette</I> is a non-commercial publication and will remain
that way. A tar, gzip file containing all issues of <I>Linux Gazette</I>
and one containing the current issue can be found at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ssc.com/lg/">ftp://ftp.ssc.com/lg/</A>
</P>

<P>Thanks also go to <B>Matt Welsh</B>, coordinator of the <B>Linux Documentation
Project</B>, for graciously bringing the <I>Linux Gazette</I> under the
auspices of the LDP. The material included in these documents is covered
by a designedly liberal copyright: as long as you are using the material
for non-commercial purposes, you can do with them as you please. </P>

<P>A new table of contents will appear with each issue that will allow
you to easily find something of interest. The current month's <I>LG</I>
is at the top. </P>

<P>Have fun! </P>

<B>Subject: Linux trademark issues. <BR>
From: Earl Stutes estutes@palladium.corp.sgi.com </B><BR>
</P>

<P>Yet again, it appears someone is attempting to make a buck on something
that most of the rest of us feel should be a free or at least public domain
thing. In this case the word Linux. I don't have any suggestions as to
how &quot;we&quot; deal directly with this issue, but I certainly hope
that all of you folks that are a part of the growing Linux commercial community
will take the lead in fighting this yo-yo. Of course part of my contribution
to support you is the fact that I buy the magazine from the newstand(Computer
Literacy, actually) every month. </P>

<P>I have enjoyed your magazine right from the beginning, and will continue
to be a supporter over the long term. </P>

<P>Thanks for listening </P>

<B>Subject: LG Issue #9 <BR>
From: Dave Pearson davep@hagbard.demon.co.uk </B><BR>
</P>

<P>Hi. </P>

<P>First, I'd like to say congrats on taking over support of the LG, it's
a very handy resource and it's nice to see it getting continued support.
</P>

<P>However, I've got a question about how you are going to handle it. In
the past I've always downloaded a copy of the latest issue of LG and installed
it on my own machine so that I could read it at my leisure. IIRC, each
issue included a new top level index file that would list the TOCs of all
issues, this ment it was simple and easy to install and to quickly search
for a specific article. </P>

<P>Correct me if I'm wrong, but issue 9 does not appear to follow this
install style. Was there a reason for this? </P>

<P>Thanks for your time. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>(You are not wrong. I did change it, not realizing what a hassle
it was going to cause some people. The reason for part of the change that
will most likely remain, is that I wanted to be able to keep issues 1-8
exactly as they were when John put them out -- i.e. not changing the front
page, etc. The way it works now should not be that different.</I> </P>

<P><I>The front page offers a spot to click for the TOC of issues 1-8 and
a spot for TOC 9. When 10 comes out next month, it will be on top of TOC
9. I personally thought that having each TOC in a separate file would make
it easier -- perhaps I was wrong, it's been known to happen. I'm considering
a search program, when I have time to set it up, and in the meantime, I
will add an index containing all TOCs. --Editor)</I> </P>

<B>Subject: new LG issue <BR>
From: Larry Ayers layers@vax2.rain.gen.mo.us </B><BR>
</P>

<P>Last night I saw the new LG issue on the SSC website. So evidently in
the last week of August writers came through for you. There are some great
articles in issue 9; an auspicious beginning for SSC's sponsorship (and
your editing duties). </P>

<P>By the way, I got an email the other day from another LG reader, complaining
that the graphics from the TkDesk article I wrote in LG #8 were not accessible
to a web-browser. I loaded the article into Netscape (from the SSC website)
and found this to be true. Perhaps the directory structure was changed
somehow when LG #8 was put on the site, rendering a link inactive? I just
checked issue 8 again, and found that most of the inline images in my pieces
won't display. I think the problem is that the directory which John Fisk
used was ./gx/ayers, whereas it looks like SSC's gazette graphics all go
in ./gx. </P>

<P>Regards, Larry Ayers </P>

<P><I>(Thanks. Yes, authors did come through for me, including you, and
I thank you all.</I> </P>

<P><I>Sorry, I know about the problem with the links, and it is now fixed.

files. --Editor) </I></P>

<P>I just tried to take a look at the Linux Gazette Issue #9. Unfortunately,
I did not find the &quot;I'll read it myself&quot; button at the top of
the index that would allow me to see the whole thing at one time and print
it out for later reading at home. I would appreciate if you could add this
option back, rather than causing me to have to go into each section to
print it out so that I can read it later at home. </P>

From: tinus@betterthan.northstar.k12.ak.us (Sunit Das) </B><BR>
</P>

<P>Hello! I was wondering if you have an archive with the past issues of
the Linux Gazette(tar-ed and gzip-ed) so that us (the readers) can download
and browse at our leisure? If not, would it be too much trouble to do so?
I hope I'm not imposing too much, but I am on a shared phone line, and
much as I would like to stay on the net all day (it's tempting), I can't.
Thanks for *any* help! </P>

<P><I>(No problem. tar files are available, I've just been having technical
difficulties -- they were unreadable. At any rate John Fisk sent us new

From: &quot;Johannes Norinder&quot; dante@inferno.skurup.se </B><BR>
</P>

<P>My suggestion is that you ought to have some kind of simple search engine
so that you easily can search for phrases within one or all of the issues
of LG. As is it's hard to know if you've covered Iomegas Zipdrive, for
example. </P>

<P>Otherwise thanks for a great service. </P>

<P>Johannes Norinder </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>(I agree. In fact it's something that I have already thought about.
There is a search engine for Linux Journal, and I will probably use the
same one for the Gazette. However, it means doing a lot of front end work
to get it set up. When I'll have time to do this is not certain, but it
is definitely on the list. --Editor) </I></P>

<B>Subject: Linux Gazette <BR>
From: Bill Cronk bcronk@nvl.army.mil </B><BR>
</P>

<P>I am very glad to see a new issue put out. I was sad thinking that it
had gone by the wayside. </P>

<P>I would like to see a section of tips and tricks devoted towards the
novice user who needs to learn the tricks to setting up hardware, software
and all the other things that come along. I remember when the first Byte
magazine came out and for the longest time there were articles on hardware
and software for the novices. After a while that ended as people grew up
and demanded more in depth articles. I would think that most people would
have a hard time finding those back issues. In the case of the Gazette
all the back issues will most likely be archived and if a basic index was
published once or twice a year many new people to the world of Linux would
have all kinds of useful tips and tricks to read through. </P>

<P>Either way I enjoy reading the Gazette and will look forward to new
issues. I wish you success in publishing the Gazette. </P>

<P>In the future, maybe the far future, I will be able to provide an article
now and then on some hardware and software items related to laboratory
instrumentation interfacing and controlling of automated test equipment.
</P>

<P>Best wishes,<BR>

<P>I suspect many/most of you have seen the new logo promoted by Linux

or hardware product works with Linux. See: <BR>
http://www.linuxjournal.com/Morelj/cool.html <BR>
</P>

<P>What is a very pleasant surprise is to see that logo starting to appear
in the mainstream trade press. On page 41 of the September 16, 1996, InfoWorld,
is a half-page Equinox ad for their multiport serial cards. The COOL logo
is the first one displayed, before Windoze, Novell, or SCO. </P>

<B>Subject: LG : french translation + mirroring ? <BR>
From: Patrick Mevzek &lt;Patrick.Mevzek@Babbage.espci.fr&gt; <BR>
</B>To: fiskjm@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu <BR>
</P>

<P>Hi, </P>

<P>I discovered your Linux Gazette some months ago, and it's great and
very interesting. I've discovered Linux a little before, because I will
need to install here at my school (you know I'm only a student like you
;-) !!) a small LAN of computers for students, with PC (Win 95) and one
LINUX-PC (which will be a firewall-mailhost-webserver, etc...). So I'm
quite interested with everything in relation with Linux. </P>

<P>In fact, I can propose you to translate the LG in French. I would be
very pleased to do that. But I can promise you I will always have enough
time to do it quickly, because first I'm a student, and therefore I've
exams, (you know that...), and second, like I said before, I have to work
a lot to install students'LAN. </P>

<P>So, let me know if I can help you that way !! </P>

<P>BTW, because I will be the maintainer of the web server of the students
too, it could be possible, somewhat in January or February 97 to start
mirroring the LG, here at the ESPCI. I can't promise you big things, because
mainly in 3 years I won't be in that school anymore, and I can't say that
the next webserver maintainer will keep mirroring LG !! I hope to hear
from you soon </P>

<P>Regards,<BR>

<P><I>(Glad you like the magazine. John Fisk forwarded your letter to me
as SSC is now handling the Linux Gazette. I think it would be wonderful
if you were to translate the LG into French, whenever you have time. It
would certainly give the Gazette a wider French audience. We have very
liberal copying requirements, especially if you are a mirror site (virtually
none). We always welcome another mirror. Thanks for your interest. -- Editor)

Subject: Tcl/Tk tips NOT IN Welch's Book <BR>
</P>

<P>I see that you just got hooked with Tcl/Tk. </P>

<P>I found an *OLD* way of interfacing C program with Tk scripts, which
is not documented in Welch's Book. </P>

<P>What is it? Pipe! </P>

<P>My C prog (parent) create two pipes to communicate with the Tk prog
(child). The Tk prog only need to use stdin and stdout without knowing
that this is controlled by the C prog. This provides a much easier way
than the interface procedures described in Welch. </P>

<P>Attached here are my C prog and my Tk prog. If you think this is worth
writing a full article, please let me know. I will do that for the Gazette.
:) </P>

<P>Cheers <BR>

<P>Description: simple C and Tk prog pair showing how to read/write with
each other. example of use: C may use this Tk for graphical interface.
C does some image processing, then ask Tk to display it. </P>

Term Titlebar Function</H3>

<P>Date: Fri, 06 Sep 1996 17:53:00 -0600 <BR>
From: &quot;Michael J. Hammel&quot; <A HREF="mailto:mjhammel@emass.com">&lt;mjhammel@emass.com&gt;<BR>
</A>Subject: Gazette #9 comments -- xterm title bar function<BR>
</P>

<P>Nice job on the new Linux Gazette! I'm just scanning it and had a few
notes I thought I'd pass to you. </P>

<P>In the mail, there are a couple of things. Jim Murphy says that the
&quot;-print&quot; option to find is necessary to get output from the find
command and follows that up with &quot;get used to it, its *nix&quot;.
Well, he's part right. Linux does require this. However, any users who
work on other Unix boxes will find slight differences in some of the common
CLI commands (CLI is &quot;command line interface&quot;). For example,
&quot;find&quot; on Solaris does not require the -print option to get output.
Just food for thought. </P>

<P>Second, I have an xterm title bar function that people might find useful.
I'll give the code first, then explain what it does: </P>

<P>In your .bashrc (or .kshrc - note this only works on ksh style shells)
add the following: </P>

<PRE> 
HOSTNAME=`uname -n`
if [ &quot;$TERM&quot; = &quot;xterm&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$0&quot; = &quot;-bash&quot; ]
then
   ilabel () { echo -n &quot;^[]1;$*^G&quot;; }
   label () { echo -n &quot;^[]2;$*^G&quot;; }
   alias stripe='label $HOSTNAME - ${PWD#$HOME/}'
   alias stripe2='label $HOSTNAME - vi $*'
   cds () { &quot;cd&quot; $*; eval stripe; }
   vis () { eval stripe2; &quot;vi&quot; $*; eval stripe;}
   alias cd=cds
   alias vi=vis
   eval stripe
   eval ilabel &quot;$HOSTNAME&quot;
fi
</PRE>

<P>This does three things (as long as you're in an xterm and running bash):
</P>

<OL>
<LI>when the xterm is first opened, the name of the current host is displayed
in the title bar. </LI>

<LI>when you cd to a directory, the current path is displayed in the xterm
title bar with the users $HOME directory stripped off the front end of
the path (to save some space when you're somewhere in your own directory
tree). The path is preceded by the current hosts network name. </LI>

<LI>when you use vi to edit a file the name of the file is displayed in
the title bar along with the current hosts name. When you exit your vi
session, the title bar reverts to the &quot;hostname - path&quot; format
described in #2 above. </LI>
</OL>

<P>I found this very useful for all my ksh based systems because it removed
the path from my shell prompt, thus saving me space for prompt commands.
Since bash is a ksh compatible shell, this works quite well on standard
Linux systems. </P>

<P>Hope everyone finds this useful. </P>

</A>Subject: $0.02 tip - More on commenting code in vi <BR>
</P>

<P>I'm generally ON the code I want to comment, so instead of having to
find out line numbers and then perform a substitution on those lines to
insert # characters, I just map my # key to &quot;go to the beginning of
the current line, go into insert mode, insert a # and a space, exit insert
mode, go down one line&quot; </P>

<P>You can map your # key this way (or whatever key you want to assign
it to, but be careful) by putting the following in your .exrc file: </P>

<PRE>map # I# ^[j
</PRE>

<P>That &quot;^[&quot; is created by typing Ctrl-v and then hitting ESC,
so you literally type: </P>

<PRE>map&lt;SPACE&gt;#&lt;SPACE&gt;I#&lt;SPACE&gt;&lt;Ctrl-v&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;j
</PRE>

<P>Then all you have to do to go comment-crazy is find where you want to
start and hold down your # key. </P>

X Term Title Trick 2</H3>

<BR>
</A>Subject: Re:XTerm Title Trick 2 <BR>
</P>

<P>In issue #9 of LG, one of the two cent tips is about how to put the
hostname in the title of your xterm. It mentions precmd for csh, but not
the bash equivalent. The way I do this in bash is as follows: </P>

<PRE> 
  if [ $TERM = 'xterm' ]
  then export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne
&quot;\033]2;&quot;`whoami`@`hostname`&quot;\007&quot;'
  fi
</PRE>

<P>this can just go in your .bashrc, lots of fun. I add the whoami, because
I am a sysadmin, and its a convienient way to tell if I am root, in addition
to the '#' on the prompt. Another variation I use sometimes is : &quot;`whoami`@`hostname`:`pwd`&quot;
then I can remove the path from my prompt. </P>

<P>ps the LG is GREAT! Keep up the good work. Thank you very much! </P>

<P>Issue 8 had a 2c tip &quot;There and Back!&quot; describing a neat way

</P>

<P>Well, it's not really a trick per se. If you're like me, you make an
attempt to keep your Red Hat system current- at least, in some respects.
Tonight, looking at a man page which mentioned Linux 0.99.11 brought to
mind the thought that I should upgrade my aging Red Hat 2.0 installation
to something more current; fast on its heels was a curiousity about just
what I have taken from where. So with a little bit of shell-play and some
suggestions from my friend, the following was produced: </P>

<PRE> 
rpm -qai | grep Dist | awk -F': ' '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c
</PRE>

<P>This will tell you all the distributions you have installed RPMs from,
and the number of RPMs from each. </P>

From: Bill Duncan <A HREF="mailto:bduncan@beachnet.org">&lt;bduncan@beachnet.org&gt;<BR>
</A>Subject: find tip... <BR>
</P>

<P>Hi Jim Murphy. <BR>
Saw your &quot;find&quot; tip in issue #9, and thought you might like a
quicker method. I don't know about other distributions, but Slackware and
Redhat come with the GNU versions of locate(1) and updatedb(1) which use
an index to find the files you want. The updatedb(1) program should be
run once a night from the crontab facility. To ignore certain sub-directories
(like your /cdrom) use the following syntax for the crontab file: </P>

<PRE> 
41 5 * * *  updatedb --prunepaths=&quot;/tmp /var /proc /cdrom&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</PRE>

<P>This would run every morning at 5:41am, and update the database with
filenames from everywhere but the subdirectories (and those below) the
ones listed. </P>

<P>To locate a file, just type &quot;locate filename&quot;. The filename
can also do partial matching. The search only takes a few seconds typically,
and I have tens of thousands of files. </P>

<P>The locate(1) command also has regular expression matching, but I often
just pipe it through agrep(1) (a faster grep) to narrow the search if I
want. Thus: </P>

<PRE> 
  locate locate | agrep -v man
</PRE>

<P>..would exclude the manpage for example, and only show me the binary
and perhaps the sources if I had them online. (The -v flag excludes the
pattern used as an argument.) Or the binary alone along with a complete
directory listing of it with the following command: </P>

<PRE> 
  ls -l `locate locate | agrep bin`
</PRE>

<P>The find(1) command is a great &quot;swiss-army knife&quot; (and actually
not that bad once you get used to it), but for the 90% of the cases where
you just want to search by filename, the locate(1) command is *far* faster,
and much easier to use. </P>

<P>An intellectual property attorney friend of mine, G. Gervaise Davis

will probably be killed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as soon
as we make the proper legal moves. </P>

<P>Please forward this email to anyone/everyone. I'm especially interested
in hearing from anyone who has received a collection letter, and also from
Linus or someone else who can direct us to where the trademark should rightfully
go. Also, this effort should be coordinated nationally or globally. </P>

There is no way this is true. We have retained an attorney and will be

<P>Pablo Kiryluk of GM Communications, InterSoft's RRPP, writes: </P>

<P>Linus Torvalds, the Finish guru creator of the operating system &quot;Linux&quot;
landed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to the expectation of many. Invited
by InterSoft, the multinational software producer, Mr. Torvalds lectured
to a wide range of public about the &quot;Software Free&quot; concept,
its relation with Internet and Linux' characteristics. </P>

<P>The range of ideas spread by Linus Torvalds in Argentina where laid
out in terms of &quot;knowledge sharing&quot; and &quot;composing from
different creators&quot;. &quot;Company's tendencies will integrate parts
of free software forming a system to curb the commercial industry of software&quot;
--substantiated Mr. Torvalds. Also, the concept of &quot;the idea that
technology were humanity' patrimony, based on the free distribution of
software and its source codes&quot; was expressed in several occasions.
</P>

<P>Also, Torvalds decided also to introduce &quot;Scriptum&quot;, the first
adaptable editor to different Linux' environments, created by InterSoft.
Scriptum was created in Argentina and developed as a powerful tool capable
to run of different platforms and offer several features. With Scriptum,
almost the entire working environment can be configured, totally integrated
to RCS/SCCS tools and UNIX (grepp, diff, etc.) and powerful navigation
commands to find sources, data and documents. </P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Hams, Packet Radio and Linux</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>by Phil Hughes, WA6SWR, <A HREF="mailto:phil@ssc.com">phil@ssc.com</A></H4>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER>Copyright (c) 1996</H5>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER>Published in Issue 10 of the Linux Gazette</H5>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>This year's ARRL/TAPR sponsored conference on Digital Communications
was in Seattle on September 20-22. Being a ham, a packet fan and 18 miles
away from the conference, I decided to attend. I also offered to bring
some <I>Linux Journal</I> magazines to give away. By the end of the conference
&quot;some&quot; had become about 100. </P>

<P>The papers presented varied from very introductory material to a serious
look at how to equalize group delay of IF filters. Many of the papers and
one of the three workshops dealt with a system called Automatic Position
Report System. For those not familiar with this, a GPS receiver is combined
with a packet station to send out position reports. </P>

<P>But, the purpose of this article is not to talk about the &quot;ham
content&quot; of the conference (if you want more info on that, check out
<A HREF="http://www.tapr.org/">http://www.tapr.org/</A>, but to talk about
the L-word. </P>

<P>In the first workshop (on APRS), Keith Sproul demonstrated both a Windows
and a Mac version of the system, but regularly referenced the fact that
a Linux version also existed. I was surprised (as there was no mention
of a Sun version or any other Unix-like version), but I was now sure that
Linux had infiltrated the ham packet radio community pretty seriously.
</P>

<P>The L-word then continued to come up in discussions with people. It
varied from comments about installing Linux to how Linux became a significant
part of a ham network. For example, in Barry McLarnon and Dennis Rosenauer's
presentation on Wireless Networking Using the WA4DSY 56K RF Modem Technology,
Barry said &quot;Linux is the platform of choice&quot;. Later, when describing
the Ottawa MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) he pointed out that their Internet
server (hydra.carleton.ca) is a Linux box, and they, when talking about
the packet gateway machine, said &quot;It hasn't been converted to Linux
yet.&quot; </P>

<P>At the end of their presentation we had a chance to play with a wireless
network set up in the room. The machine on one end of the 56K link was
running Linux as was one downstream machine off the other end. </P>

<P>All in all, the conference was good for Linux. </P>

</P>

<P>Mark A. Horton (mah@netmha.com) passed away Friday September 7, 1996.
Cause currently unknown, but poor health is suspected. he did have a lot
of health problems, although he never let them keep him down long, in so
many ways he was such an inspiration! </P>

<P>Having been through the rest of the *nixes, and knowing the subject
well, he was one of the greatest proponents of Linux. His enthusiasm and
willingness to help anyone at any time were his greatest gifts to the Linux
community. </P>

<P>His kindness, willingness to help others in many ways including Linux
and his generosity will be missed by those of us that knew him and an example
for all of us to strive for. For me personally, he was my best friend and
mentor. He taught myself and *MANY* others much about the nuts and bolts
of Linux in a joyous way that was informative and instructive and often
most pleasantly humorous. Most any interaction with Mark was a good time.
</P>

<P>Having spent a great many hours with him personally as well as on the
phone, he made is very clear that he didn't want any morose happenings
should anything ever happen to him, There will be a party by his friends
to honor that request sometime in the near future. Will plan on celebrating
his contributions and the many wonderful things that there are to be remembered
about him. He was one of the true good guys and his joyous, creative, tenacious,
encouraging spirit will be missed by those that knew him. To the many that
knew Mark and to the many who didn't, hoist one to one of the greats! He
will be missed. </P>

of a tiny utility called, <B><FONT SIZE=+1>mconv2</FONT></B>. Mconv2 allows
several programs to use a PS/2 type mouse at the same time. <BR>
</P>

<P>The mconv2 utility also supports the use of a PS/2 type mouse with applications
that do not understand the PS/2 mouse protocol, but understand the microsoft
serial mouse protocol (such as <I>svgalib</I>). This document only descrdibes
the sharing of the PS/2 type mouse - not its use as a microsoft type mouse
- for information on this, read the <B>README</B> file included with the
mconv2 distribution. <BR>
</P>

<P>Installing and using mconv2 is <B>VERY</B> simple :- <BR>

<OL>
<LI><B>Getting mconv2</B> <BR>
Mconv2 can be downloaded from a variety of Linux archive sites. I got my
copy from <BR>

<BR>
</P></CENTER>

<LI><B>Extracting Distribution<BR>
</B>Mconv2 is distributed as a compressed (gz) tar archive. Hence, it needs
to be extraceted in a suitable directory before it can be installed. I
used the <I>/usr/src</I> directory, but any directory will do. Copy the
mconv2 distribution file (mconv2.tar.gz) to the selected working directory,
eg. <I>/usr/src</I> (or the directory you care to extract it in) as follows
:- <BR>
</LI>

<PRE>    cp mconv2.tar.gz /usr/src
  </PRE>

<P>Go to the working directory and extract the mconv2 archive, as follows
:- <BR>
</P>

<PRE>    cd /usr/src
    tar -zxvf mconv2.tar.gz 
  </PRE>

<P>This will create a subdirectory called <I>mconv2</I> containing, </P>

<UL>
<LI>the mconv2 source code - <I>mconv2.c</I> </LI>

<LI>a binary compiled mconv2 executable - <I>mconv2</I> </LI>

<LI>supporting documentation files - <I>mconv2.lsm</I> and <I>README</I>
</LI>
</UL>

<P><BR>
</P>

<LI><B>To compilie mconv2, or not</B> <BR>
Together with the source and supporting documentation, the mconv2 distribution
also comes with a pre-built binary of the program. This can be used as-is
or the program can be recompiled very easily, as follows :- <BR>
</LI>

<PRE>    gcc -O2 -o mconv2 mconv2.c
  </PRE>

<P><BR>
</P>

<LI><B>Installing the mconv2 binary</B> Copy the pre-built, or newly made,
mconv2 binary file (<I>mconv2</I>) to an appropriate directory for executing
binarys from - I use <I>/usr/local/bin</I>. <BR>

</LI>

<PRE>    mkfifo -m 666 /dev/ps2mouse
  </PRE>

<P><BR>
</P>

<LI><B>Using mconv2</B> <BR>
Before running any programs using the PS/2 mouse, mconv2 should be run
first and other programs needing the mouse, should be configured to use
the PS/2 pseudo device, <I>/dev/ps2mouse</I>. It is probably best, to start
mconv2 from the <I>/etc/rc.d.rc.local</I> file with the following command
:- </LI>

<PRE>    echo -n &quot;Runnig mconv2 .... &quot;
    /usr/local/bin/mconv2 /dev/psaux -ps2 /dev/ps2mouse &amp;
    echo &quot;Done&quot;
  </PRE>

<P><B>NOTE :- this assumes your original mouse device was /dev/psaux</B>
<BR>
</P>

<LI><B>Configuring other programms to use mconv2</B> <BR>
As mentioned in the point above, other programs requiring the PS/2 mouse
must be configured to use the mconv2 pseudo mouse device - <I>/dev/ps2mouse</I>.
<BR>
</LI>

<P>Examples :- <BR>
</P>

<UL>
<LI>To set up <B>gpm</B>, to use this pseudo device, invoke it as follows

<LI>To set up <B>XFree86</B> to use the pseudo device, modify the <B>Pointer</B>
section of the <B>XF86Config</B> file to set the mouse device to <B>/dev/ps2mouse</B>
as follows :- </LI>

<P>Date: Sat, 14 Sep 1996 08:33:11 -0500 (CDT) <BR>
From: &quot;Paul L. Rogers&quot; RogersPL@datasync.com <BR>
</P>

<P>Good Morning, </P>

<P>Late last week I became aware of the national NetDay96 project and volunteered
at my daughter's school. During the weekend, I realized that this was an
opportunity to involve the Linux community in a project that could not
only benefit our local schools, but expose new classes of people to Linux.
</P>

<P>If this topic is suitable for SSC's ventures to publicize, please help
spread the word. For NetDay96, maybe something in the _Linux Gazette_ could
reach a few people in time to for them to make a contribution. If there
is a NetDay97, perhaps an article in the _Linux Journal_ reporting on NetDay96
with suggestions on how to promote Linux during such an event would be
appropriate. </P>

<P>Attached is a posting that recently (1996/09/13) appeared on comp.os.linux.announce.
</P>

<P>A data point: The October 1996 LJ arrived in Ocean Springs, Mississippi
on Friday. </P>

<P>I strongly agree with &quot;Linux people, now is the time to strike.&quot;
and have recently become much more aggressive in sharing my experiences
with Linux. Would you be interested in an article providing guidelines
and suggestions on how to promote Linux? </P>

<P>Thank you for your time and if this project is not suitable for SSC,
perhaps other opportunities will allow us to work together in the future.
</P>

<H3>NetDay96 </H3>

<P>In the United States of America, preparations are under way for NetDay96.
NetDay96 is a grass-roots effort to install the basic wiring required to
make classrooms network ready. </P>

<P>If Linux enthusiasts across the United States would participate in their
local NetDay96 and be prepared to follow up with assistance in creating
highly functional and reliable networks for our school systems, much favorable
publicity could be generated for the Linux movement. </P>

<P>This is an unique opportunity to expand the name recognition of Linux.
</P>

<P>The following steps describe how you can help: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Volunteer to help wire a school and wear a Linux T-Shirt to the event.
</LI>

<LI>Be prepared to discuss the benefits (and limitations) of Linux. </LI>

<LI>Suggest that your Linux User's Group sponsors a school by funding a
wiring kit. The cost of the wiring kit ranges from $339 to $376 depending
on the vendor. </LI>

<LI>Contact a local Linux-based Internet Service Provider and request their
support for NetDay96. </LI>
</UL>

<P>For more information on NetDay96 or to volunteer, feel free to visit
their web site at <A HREF="http://www.netday96.com">http://www.netday96.com</A>.
</P>

<P>Some guidelines can be found at <A HREF="http://www.li.org/NetDay96-guidelines.html">http://www.li.org/NetDay96-guidelines.html
</A></P>

<P>If you volunteer, please consider sharing your experiences and success
stories with the community by sending them to <A HREF="mailto:li@li.org">li@li.org</A>.
We will post a report summarizing the success of this event. </P>

<P>If you do not live in the United States, you may want to consider organizing
a similar project for your community. </P>

<P>I have written a template for use by GIMP plug-in authors to write documentation
that will look good and be fairly uniform for our users. There is also
a detailed explanation that goes with it. The explanation is, in a sense,
a general explanation on how to use the LinuxDoc package, since that's
what we've decided to use for the GIMP Documentation Project. </P>

<P>You can take a look at both the template and the explanation at: <A HREF="http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel/gimp/gdp/gdp.html">http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel/gimp/gdp/gdp.html</A>

<P>This is a long page, but don't let that scare you. Creating your documents
in SGML and using LinuxDoc tools to create your HTML, GNU Info, Man Page,

<H2>The Title Information Section</H2>

<P>This section has 6 tags in it: </P>

<UL>
<LI>article </LI>

<LI>title </LI>

<LI>author </LI>

<LI>inst </LI>

<LI>date </LI>

<LI>abstract </LI>
</UL>

<P>All of these tags are mandatory and <B>must</B> be placed in this order.
</P>

<P>The <I>article</I> tag has no other text associated with it. It is put
on a line by itself and is a marker to the SGML parser telling the parser
what kind of document is to be created. <BR>
Example: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;article&gt;
</PRE>

<P>The <I>title</I> tag is the name of the Plug-In. This must be one line
long and on the same line as the <I>title</I> tag. <BR>
Example: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;title&gt;The Sparkle Plug-In
</PRE>

<P>The <I>author</I> tag identifies the author of the Plug-In. This should
simply be the name of the developer. Along with this is a tag which identifies
the email address of the author. The code for the email address looks similar
to the following. <BR>
Example: <BR>
</P>

<PRE>        &lt;author&gt;Michael J. Hammel
        &lt;htmlurl url=&quot;mailto:user@some.net&quot; name=&quot;&amp;lt;user@some.net&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Just substitute the appropriate email address. Note that the use of
<TT>&amp;amplt; </TT>and <TT>&amp;ampgt; </TT>are required. These get translated
into the less-than and greater-than signs, respectively, in the output.
</P>

<P>The <I>inst</I> tag is just the current version number of the Plug-In
source code. <BR>
Example: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;inst&gt;Version 1.0
</PRE>

<P>The <I>date</I> tag is the date that the source code was last updated.
The format of the text that goes with this tag should look like the following:
<BR>
Example: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;date&gt;Last Updated: 09/01/96
</PRE>

<P>The <I>abstract</I> tag marks the beginning of a paragraph of text that
describes, in general, what the Plug-In does. This is free formatted text
and must be followed by the &lt;abstract&gt; tag. <BR>
Example: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;abstract&gt;
                Some text goes here.
        &lt;/abstract&gt;

<H2>The Introduction Section</H2>

<P>This section contains two subsections: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Where to get the software </LI>

<LI>How to build the software </LI>
</UL>

<P>Both of these are mandatory subsections. </P>

<P>Example section header: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;sect&gt;Introduction
        &lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>The <I>Where to get the software</I> subsetion is a URL (ftp or http
address) for the source code. If a binary version is available, the binaries
location should be listed with the this subsection. <BR>
Example: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;sect1&gt;Where to get the software
        &lt;P&gt;
        The software can be retrieved from
        &lt;htmlurl url=&quot;ftp://ftp.some.net/dir/file.tar.gz&quot; 
        name=&quot;&amp;lt;ftp://ftp.some.net/dir/file.tar.gz&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;
</PRE>

<P>The <I>How to build the software</I> subsetion is simple an explanation
on how to build the software. Example: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;sect1&gt;How to build the software
        &lt;P&gt;
        Building the source should be fairly straight forward.
        Just make sure the LIBS= line points to the location of
        libgimp.a.  Also, a copy of gimp.h is included in the
        source.  You should really delete this and make gimp.h a
        symbollic link to your copy of gimp.h (wherever you're
        keeping that) so that the latest version of gimp.h is used.
</PRE>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="features"></A></P>

<H2>The Features Section</H2>

<P>The <I>Features Section</I> is an itemized list of the features that
the plug-in provides. This should include, at a minimum, a listing of all
the buttons, sliders, or input fields in the dialog box. A very brief description
of the features can be included. This is desirable if the feature listed
is not one that is readily apparent from the dialog box. </P>

<P>Example: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;sect&gt;Features
        &lt;P&gt;
        &lt;itemize&gt;
                &lt;item&gt;Feature one
                &lt;item&gt;Feature two
                &lt;item&gt;Feature three
        &lt;/itemize&gt;
</PRE>

<P>See the section titled <I><A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/linux-info/lg/issue10/lists">Lists</A></I>
for a description on how to create lists using the template. 
<HR><A NAME="dialog"></A></P>

<H2>The Dialog Box Section</H2>

<P>The <I>Dialog Box Section</I> describes the features found in the Plug-In's
pop-up dialog box and explains how they effect images. This section is
made up of an screen capture image (for the HTML formatted output files)
of the dialog box, an numbered list of features, and a feature-by-feature
breakdown. To start this section, use the followgin: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;sect&gt;The ... Dialog Box &lt;label id=&quot;dialog&quot;&gt;
        &lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Replace the three dots with the name of the Plug-In. </P>

<P>After the section header, a list of features should be provided. The
list will look something like this following: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;itemize&gt;
                &lt;item&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;ref id=&quot;feature1&quot; name=&quot;Feature One&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
                &lt;item&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;ref id=&quot;feature2&quot; name=&quot;Feature Two&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
                &lt;item&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;ref id=&quot;feature3&quot; name=&quot;Feature Three&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/itemize&gt;
</PRE>

<P>The <I>name</I> tag is what will show up in the list. The <I>id</I>
tag is a cross reference that you will use later. The <I>&lt;em&gt;</I>
tags just cause the stuff inbetween to be put in italics. </P>

<P>After you create the list, you should force a break after the image.
This will only affect HTML output for now. This is the line you should
add to force the break: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;![%fmthtml; [ &lt;? &lt;BR clear=&quot;both&quot;&gt; &gt; ]]&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Now you should add the subsections that fully explain each feature.
For the first item in the list above, you would add the following: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;sect1&gt;Feature One &lt;label id=&quot;feature1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;P&gt;
        This is the text explaining the first feature.
</PRE>

<P>The <I>sect1</I> tag signifies you are starting a subsection. The <I>label</I>
with its <I>id</I> gives this section a name that can be used as a cross-reference.
We used this in the list of features earlier. </P>

<P>You would have a subsection just like this for each feature in your
dialog box. 
<HR><A NAME="examples"></A></P>

<H2>The Examples Section (and how to use format-specific tags)</H2>

<P>This section is more complex than the others. Examples of how the GIMP
Plug-Ins work aren't of much use without some images to go with them. Unfortunately,
not all output formats support images (remember: we're using SGML so we
can create HTML, info, man pages, and whatever other formats are supported
by the LinuxDoc package). We need to force this section to be processed
differently depending on which formatter we're running the SGML source
through. The way we do this is to use format-specific tags and the SGML
equivalent of an escape sequence. You're already seen one of these in the
section where we forced an HTML break tag. The generic format of this SGML
tag is: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;![%fmttag; [ &lt;? ... &gt; ]]&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Where <I>fmttag</I> is one of </P>

<UL>
<LI>fmthtml </LI>

<LI>fmttxt </LI>

<LI>fmttex </LI>

<LI>fmtrtf </LI>

<LI>and so forth </LI>
</UL>

<P>and the 3 dots are the format-specific text you want to be passed directly
to the output file. If the sgml parser sees the <I>fmttag</I> tag and it
matches the output format you've requested then the format-specific text
is written to the output file. If it doesn't match the format requested,
the text is ignored. </P>

<P>Thats the technical explanation. Whats worse is it doesn't appear to
work (or I'm doing it wrong - one of the two). </P>

<P>Until I figure this problem out you have one of two choices: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Put in a URL pointing to examples on some other page </LI>

<LI>Use the Sparkle SGML source as an example. </LI>
</UL>

<H2>The Notes Section</H2>

<P>The <I>Notes Section</I> is the place to stuff everything that doesn't
fit neatly into the other sections, such as known bugs, limitations, or
future enhancements that are planned. </P>

<P>Example: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;sect&gt;Notes
        &lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="toc"></A></P>

<H2>The Table of Contents</H2>

<P>This is a single line that goes immediately after the <I>Title Information
Section</I> and immediately before the <I>Introduction Section</I>. It
should look exactly like this: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;toc&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="sections"></A></P>

<H2>Section Markers</H2>

<P>There are several layers of sections available, but we only require
the top two: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;sect&gt;
        &lt;sect1&gt;
</PRE>

<P>The <I>sect</I> tag forces a new page in the output files. The <I>sect1</I>
just gets another type of formatting on that same page. You can add <I>sect2</I>
and <I>sect3</I> levels if you want, but I'm not sure what they do to the
output. </P>

<P>Note that you <B>must</B> put the following immediately after the section
tags: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;p&gt;
</PRE>

<P>This tells the SGML parser to end the section header and begin the part
of the document that belongs in that section. 
<HR><A NAME="paragraphs"></A></P>

<H2>Forcing new paragraphs</H2>

<P>This is simple, just add the following: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;p&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Note that its also possible to use blank lines to force new paragraphs,
but whether the SGML parser uses the blank line as a paragraph or not depends
on where its used. Its easier to just use the above tag to be sure. 
<HR><A NAME="comments"></A></P>

<H2>Comments</H2>

<P>If you want to put comments in your SGML, you would do it like so: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;-- This is an SGML Comment line --&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Note that this is very similar to the HTML comment. 
<HR><A NAME="lists"></A></P>

<H2>Lists</H2>

<P>To create a bulleted list, do the following: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;itemize&gt;
                &lt;item&gt;Item one
                &lt;item&gt;Item two
                &lt;item&gt;Item three
        &lt;/itemize&gt;
</PRE>

<P>To create a numbered list, do the following: </P>

<PRE>        &lt;enum&gt;
                &lt;item&gt;Item one
                &lt;item&gt;Item two
                &lt;item&gt;Item three
        &lt;/enum&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Pretty straight forward, really. 
<HR><A NAME="test-sgml"></A></P>

<H2>How to test your SGML</H2>

<P>You can verify your SGML documentation will work with the various format
converters by running it through each one. For example, to check if you
can get the HTML output with an SGML file called <I>plugin.sgml</I>, try:
</P>

<PRE>        sgml2html plugin
</PRE>

<P>To get text output, try: </P>

<PRE>        sgml2txt plugin
</PRE>

<P>To get man page output in groff format, try: </P>

<PRE>        sgml2txt -man plugin
</PRE>

<P>You should read the man pages for each of the sgml2&lt;whatever&gt;
commands to learn the command line options. They are really pretty easy
to use. 
<HR><A NAME="linuxdoc-updates"></A></P>

<H2>Updates I've made to the LinuxDoc package</H2>

<P>I've made two distinct changes to the LinuxDoc package. The first is
to the linuxdoc.dtd file, found under the <TT>lib/dtd</TT> directory after
you unpack LinuxDoc. The following was added right before the last line:
</P>

<PRE>&lt;!-- added fmt* which were somehow missing --&gt;
&lt;!-- default is ignore, override on commandline in sgml2* --&gt;
&lt;!entity % fmttex  &quot;ignore&quot;&gt;
&lt;!entity % fmthtml &quot;ignore&quot;&gt;
&lt;!entity % fmttxt  &quot;ignore&quot;&gt;
&lt;!entity % fmtinfo &quot;ignore&quot;&gt;
&lt;!entity % fmtrtf  &quot;ignore&quot;&gt;
&lt;!entity % fmtlyx  &quot;ignore&quot;&gt;
</PRE>

<P>These allow for format-specific tags in the SGML source so you can,
for example, add a graphic in your HTML output but just include the description
of the image in your text output. </P>

<P>The other change was to the html2html.l flex file under html-fix. The
changes aren't complex, but theres a number of them to allow for command
line options to set the background, text, and link colors. If you want
this I can send it to you, but its not really necessary to test your SGML
before submitting it to me. 
<HR><A NAME="various-formats"></A></P>

<H2>Notes about creating documents in the various formats</H2>

<P>First of all, there are a set of scripts in LinuxDoc for creating documents
in the various formats: </P>

<UL>
<LI>sgml2html </LI>

<LI>sgml2txt </LI>

<LI>sgml2info </LI>

<LI>sgml2rtf </LI>

<LI>sgml2lyx </LI>

<LI>sgml2latex </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Note</B>: In order to do format specific tagging, you'll need to
update your linuxdoc.dtd file. See the section on LinuxDoc Updates (found
on the website listed in the introductory section of this article) for
the details. </P>

<P>The first of these, sgml2html, was used to create the new Sparkle documentation,
as well as the HTML version of the SGML template. It works quite well using
&quot;free-formatted&quot; input files. By free-formatted I mean that the
actual text (not the formatting tags) can be one word per line or any number
of words per line and the output will come out nicely formatted using as
many words as will fit in your web browser. </P>

<P>The text formatter, sgml2txt, also works quite well. The output has
various formatting characters that work well with the &quot;less&quot;
and, possibly, &quot;more&quot; pagers. </P>

<P>The GNU Info formatter, sgml2info, is not happy with such free formatting
of the text, however. </P>

<P>I have not tried the other formatters yet. I don't know what RTF is
and I've not used the Lyx or Latex tools so I'm not sure how to test the
output from these formatters. </P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER>Published in Issue 10 of the Linux Gazette</H5>

<P>Have you been thinking of seting up a reachable web server at your home
PC in addition to your permenent page at ISP? There are obvious reasons
to do this: You can show off your home linux box to the world; you do not
need to use other messy method (email) to know your current IP in order
to login remotely; finally, it is fun! </P>

<P>First, You need to have ppp connection and httpd working and a PERMANENT
web page before trying the following dynamic IP solution. </P>

<H3>Description of files: </H3>

<P><B>web_up: </B>shell script I run to update webpage at permenet site
with new IP whenever connection is up. </P>

<P><B>web_down:</B> shell script I run before shutting down the link, to
inform others of the shutdown </P>

<P><B>update_uppage:</B> perl scripts to creat up.html page with updated
IP address on the fly, called by web_up. </P>

<P><B>up.html_source:</B> fixed part of up.html </P>

<P><B>down.html:</B> web page used when link is down. </P>

<P><B>/etc/add, /etc/last_add:</B> files where I put IP address. </P>

<P><B>ip-down, ip-up:</B> files executed when ppp link is disconnected
or connected. they are used to update the /etc/add files here. </P>

<H3>Now lets look at scripts web_up: </H3>

<PRE>------------------------------------------------------------------

    #!/bin/sh
    #check new IP
    new_ip()
    {
    if [ -f /etc/add ]; then
       if [ -f /etc/last_add ]; then
          if /usr/bin/diff /etc/add /etc/last_add &gt;/dev/null ; then
              exit 1 
          else
              return 0 
          fi
       else
          return 0
       fi
    else
       exit 1
    fi
    }

    #check whether maroon is connected
    try_connect()
    {
    if ping -c4 -l3 128.101.118.21  2&gt;&amp;1 | grep &quot;0 packets&quot; &gt; /dev/null
    then 
       return 1
    else
       return 0
    fi
    }
                    
    if try_connect
    then
         touch  /var/run/maroon_connected  
    else
         rm -f /var/run/maroon_connected
    fi

    # ftp to update page
    if [ -f /var/run/maroon_connected ] &amp;&amp; new_ip
    then
       # update_uppage is perl scripts, exit status is opposite of shell
       if ( ! /home/honglu/public_html/update_uppage )
       then 
          cd /home/honglu/public_html
          if echo &quot;put up.html /nlhome/m508/luxxx012/dynamic.html&quot; \
              | /usr/bin/ftp maroon  
          then 
             rm -f /etc/last_add
             cp /etc/add  /etc/last_add
             exit 0
          else
             exit 1
          fi
       fi
    else
        exit 1
    fi

-----------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>

<P>Now let's look at web_up in detail. </P>

<P>Function <B>new_ip()</B> is used to check whether we have new IP and
whether the new IP is different from the last one. /etc/ppp/ip-up and /etc/ppp/ip-down
update IP adress in files /etc/add and /etc/last_add so that we can compare
files &quot;add&quot; with &quot;last_add&quot; to tell whether we need
to update page. </P>

<P>Function <B>try_connect()</B> is used to test whether the perment web
site is reachable. </P>

<P>Next is fun part, I used automatic feature of <B>ftp</B> to update webpage.
In order to make it work, you have to set file ~/.netrc correctly, type
&quot;man ftp&quot; for more information. </P>

<P><B>update_uppage</B> is straitforward perl scripts to parse and creat
up.html by using new IP from /etc/add file. </P>

<P>Final part is to update /etc/add /etc/last_add to reflect correct status
IP address. </P>

<P>You can put &quot;web_up&quot; in your crontab entry ( or ip-up, or
keapalive.sh) to let it execute automatically whenever your PC is connected.</P>

<H3>Web_down is a similar page, main difference is in ftp part: </H3>

<PRE>-----------------------------------------------------
......
......
# ftp to send down.html page 
if [ -f /var/run/maroon_connected ] 
then
      cd /home/honglu/public_html
      if  echo &quot;put down.html /nlhome/m508/luxxx012/dynamic.html&quot; \
        | /usr/bin/ftp maroon  
      then
          rm -f /etc/last_add
      else
          exit 1
      fi
else
      exit 1
fi

----------------------------------------------------
</PRE>

<P>Instead of ftp up.html as web_up did, web_down put down.html to permenent
web site to inform the delink of page. </P>

<P>web_down should be run before you shut down the machine. I created a
scripts called &quot;shut&quot; to shutdown machine: </P>

<PRE>-----------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
if web_down
then
   shutdown -h now
else
   echo &quot;can not web_down&quot;
   exit 1
fi

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>XaoS: A New Fractal Program for Linux</H2>

<CENTER><P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="mailto: layers@vax2.rain.gen.mo.us">by Larry
Ayers</A></H4>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER>Published in Issue 10 of the Linux Gazette</H5>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>Transforming certain recursive complex-number formulae into images of
unlimited depth and complexity was only made possible by the development
of the modern computer. Benoit Mandelbrot, a Belgian researcher working
for IBM, first discovered the Mandelbrot set in 1981. By the mid-eighties
personal computers had evolved to the point that anyone could experiment
with various fractals, and programmers soon discovered that the 8-bit 256-color
vga palette could be mapped to various parameters, which allowed the creation
of stunning animated images. </P>

<P>The most comprehensive and feature-filled of all fractal-generation
programs is Fractint, a freeware program originally written for DOS. Fractint
is maintained by a far-flung group of developers, rather like Linux. It
was ported to unix by Ken Shirriff and a Linux version is commonly included
in many Linux distributions. Not all features of the DOS version work in
Linux, and if you just want to see what fractals are all about Fractint
is probably overkill. It has such a multitude of options and features that
it can be somewhat overwhelming to a new user. </P>

<P>Recently Jan Hubicka (developer of the Koules X-window game) and Thomas
Marsh have released a small fractal program for Linux called XaoS. This
is an efficient program, with the option to compile both X-Windows and
SVGA-console versions. XaoS can't render the dozens of fractal types which
Fractint can, but it does the basic Mandelbrot and Julia sets quickly,
with several keyboard options. </P>

<P>It's developers refer to XaoS as &quot;an interactive real-time fractal
zoomer,&quot; and zooming in on an area of the Mandelbrot set is where
XaoS excels. Pressing a mouse button anywhere in the image will begin a
zoom with the location of the cursor as target. The &quot;autopilot&quot;
mode is quite impressive; pressing &quot;a&quot; will start an automatic
zoom which homes in on detailed areas. In the X-windows version the default
window-size is 320x200; if you don't mind the cpu-usage a small XaoS window
zooming away on the desktop can be pleasant to contemplate as you pause
in your work. For those working in virtual consoles an SVGAlib version
can be run in a variety of resolutions. </P>

<P>Generating fractal images is inherently CPU-intensive. The faster your
processor the better, especially when zooming in real time. XaoS does pretty
well on my 80-mhz 486, but this may be near the lower limit. </P>

<P>Here's a screenshot of XaoS:<BR>
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../gx/ayers/xaos.gif" ALT="XaoS Window at 320x200" HEIGHT=231 WIDTH=328 ALIGN=CENTER>
</P>

<P>XaoS only works on 8-bit displays at present, as is also true of Fractint.
Images can be saved to GIF files by means of a keystroke. 
<HR></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Installation</H3>

<P>Xaos uses a configure script for compilation, and it should compile
easily on most systems. The executable is only about fifty kilobytes and
is completely self-contained, i.e. no subsidiary files are required. 
<HR></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Availability</H3>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.realtime.net/~amadeus/XaoS">Xaos home-page</A>
is a good source for the latest version; the source has also been uploaded
to <A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/Incoming">Sunsite</A> and its
mirrors. </P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER>Published in Issue 10 of the Linux Gazette</H5>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>Netscape binaries are more-or-less freely available for Linux, and the
program works well, most of the time. As a Linux user I've become accustomed
to a large potential for customization in software, right down to the source-code
level. Netscape is available only as a large, opaque executable and the
source is proprietary. I don't necessarily want a web-browser to fetch
email and newspostings for me; I use other programs for those purposes
but with Netscape those functions are unwanted baggage, loaded into memory
every time the browser start up. </P>

<P>The recent beta versions of Xmosaic (the latest is 2.7b5) have been
quicker-loading alternatives. Background colors and images are supported,
but it just isn't as quick to load images and pages as Netscape. </P>

<P>Scott Powers, head of the Xmosaic development team at the University
of Illinois, has for the past couple of months been leading a new Xmosaic
project. The Xmosaic developers felt that the code upon which the version
2.7 and earlier browsers had been based needed a complete rewrite. Version
2.8 is now in public alpha testing. The project has been dubbed &quot;Hyperion&quot;,
as a sign that something totally new is in the works. </P>

<P>A mailing list for Hyperion has arisen lately. Perusing the messages
from the developers one can feel the excitement in the air. These people
are really motivated, and working extremely long hours as well. Most days
a &quot;snapshot&quot; of that day's code level is available from their
ftp site. </P>

<P>The first alpha releases were pretty rudimentary; there was no image
support and many HTML files couldn't be loaded. I think that the source
code was released at such an early level so that the developers could be
sure that the core parsing routines, etc., could be successfully compiled
on all targeted platforms. On September 10 the alpha version 2 was completed
and released. Image support is now functional, though at this stage you
must use specific versions of the JPEG and Xpm libraries. There's still
a long way to go before Xmosaic 2.8 is actually very usable, but that's
what the alpha tester's reports are helping to expedite. 
<HR></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>What Can We Expect?</H3>

<P>Scott Powers and the rest of the Hyperion team have an impressive list
of planned features. One of the most exciting is a modularization of the
source code. This means that if you wanted a speedy, basic browser the
compile-time option would be available to not include, say, Java and sound
support. A user could conceivably compile several versions, each with different
capabilities. </P>

<P>Developers of web-browsers are faced with some difficult decisions.
What standards to follow? How many of the &quot;Netscape-isms&quot; are
now prevalent enough to be considered desirable? As an example, tables
are now standard and to be expected in any new browser, as are forms. Frames
are another matter; they are common on the web but many find them of limited
value and they have yet to gain widespread acceptance. Xmosaic 2.8 will
be HTML-3 compliant, and various sorts of multimedia support are being
discussed. The alpha-testers have been making numerous suggestions, and
their ideas are being taken seriously by the Xmosaic team. 
<HR></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Locations and Sources</H3>

<P>If you'd like to check in from time to time and see what progress has
been made, <A HREF="http://xmosaic.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hyperion/">Xmosaic 2.8</A>
is the home-page. The current alpha (and before too long, beta) version
source code can be downloaded from the page. The <A HREF="ftp://xmosaic.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hyperion/download">ftp
site</A> might be faster, but at this early stage the source code is only
about three hundred kilobytes. Information concerning the mailing list
is also on the home page. </P>

<P>I encourage anyone who has a little time and the inclination to participate
in the alpha testing. Every bug report contributes to a higher quality
final release, and I'd hate to see Xmosaic 2.8 work really well only on
Sparc or HPUX machines because not enough Linux users contributed reports!

<P>I must say that after 2 months of being the Editor of the Gazette, I
am still having fun, and judging from the mail I think you guys, our readers,
are too. John Fisk is right--the Gazette is a lot of work, and worth every
bit of it. </P>

<P>Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who
wrote giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also
to our new mirror sites. I get more mail about mirrors than just about
anything, except maybe readers wanting the Gazette to be available as one
big file. We are providing that this month along with the separate page
format. (See The Whole Damn Thing in the Table of Contents.) Doing the
Gazette in multi-file format is just the easiest way for me to build the
magazine. I've tried to be responsive to all mail and reasonable requests.
If I missed you, send your mail again, and I'll get back to you. </P>

<P>The most important thing I'm working on outside of work these days is
definitely &quot;not Linux&quot;. I'm making a baby quilt for a friend
of mine in Houston. The baby is 2 months old now, and if I don't get it
finished soon, it will be too small for her to use. The geometry, as well
the art, of quilting has always fascinated me--must have to do with being
a math person. </P>

<P>If you would like some personal information about me, clicking on my
name below will take you to my home page. It's not very jazzy at the moment,
but I'm looking for the time to fix it up. </P>
