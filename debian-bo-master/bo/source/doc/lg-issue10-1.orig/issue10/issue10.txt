   Like the Linux Gazette but would you please (for us linear thinkers)
   put some navigation aid so we can go to next and previous pages? I

   Subject: Linux trademark issues.
   From: Earl Stutes estutes@palladium.corp.sgi.com 
   
   
   Yet again, it appears someone is attempting to make a buck on
   something that most of the rest of us feel should be a free or at
   least public domain thing. In this case the word Linux. I don't have
   any suggestions as to how "we" deal directly with this issue, but I
   certainly hope that all of you folks that are a part of the growing
   Linux commercial community will take the lead in fighting this yo-yo.
   Of course part of my contribution to support you is the fact that I
   buy the magazine from the newstand(Computer Literacy, actually) every
   month.
   
   I have enjoyed your magazine right from the beginning, and will
   continue to be a supporter over the long term.
   
   Thanks for listening

     about the Linux Journal when you refer to buying the magazine.

     in the current News Bytes section. --Editor)

   Subject: LG Issue #9
   From: Dave Pearson davep@hagbard.demon.co.uk 
   
   
   Hi.
   
   First, I'd like to say congrats on taking over support of the LG, it's
   a very handy resource and it's nice to see it getting continued
   support.
   
   However, I've got a question about how you are going to handle it. In
   the past I've always downloaded a copy of the latest issue of LG and
   installed it on my own machine so that I could read it at my leisure.
   IIRC, each issue included a new top level index file that would list
   the TOCs of all issues, this ment it was simple and easy to install
   and to quickly search for a specific article.
   
   Correct me if I'm wrong, but issue 9 does not appear to follow this
   install style. Was there a reason for this?
   
   Thanks for your time.

     (You are not wrong. I did change it, not realizing what a hassle it
     was going to cause some people. The reason for part of the change
     that will most likely remain, is that I wanted to be able to keep
     issues 1-8 exactly as they were when John put them out -- i.e. not
     changing the front page, etc. The way it works now should not be
     that different.
     
     The front page offers a spot to click for the TOC of issues 1-8 and
     a spot for TOC 9. When 10 comes out next month, it will be on top
     of TOC 9. I personally thought that having each TOC in a separate
     file would make it easier -- perhaps I was wrong, it's been known
     to happen. I'm considering a search program, when I have time to
     set it up, and in the meantime, I will add an index containing all
     TOCs. --Editor)

   Subject: new LG issue
   From: Larry Ayers layers@vax2.rain.gen.mo.us 
   
   
   Last night I saw the new LG issue on the SSC website. So evidently in
   the last week of August writers came through for you. There are some
   great articles in issue 9; an auspicious beginning for SSC's
   sponsorship (and your editing duties).
   
   By the way, I got an email the other day from another LG reader,
   complaining that the graphics from the TkDesk article I wrote in LG #8
   were not accessible to a web-browser. I loaded the article into
   Netscape (from the SSC website) and found this to be true. Perhaps the
   directory structure was changed somehow when LG #8 was put on the
   site, rendering a link inactive? I just checked issue 8 again, and
   found that most of the inline images in my pieces won't display. I
   think the problem is that the directory which John Fisk used was
   ./gx/ayers, whereas it looks like SSC's gazette graphics all go in
   ./gx.
   
   Regards, Larry Ayers
   
     (Thanks. Yes, authors did come through for me, including you, and I
     thank you all.
     
     Sorry, I know about the problem with the links, and it is now fixed.
     The directories were set up correctly; there were just a lot of
     missing files. --Editor)

   I just tried to take a look at the Linux Gazette Issue #9.
   Unfortunately, I did not find the "I'll read it myself" button at the
   top of the index that would allow me to see the whole thing at one
   time and print it out for later reading at home. I would appreciate if
   you could add this option back, rather than causing me to have to go
   into each section to print it out so that I can read it later at home.

   From: tinus@betterthan.northstar.k12.ak.us (Sunit Das) 
   
   
   Hello! I was wondering if you have an archive with the past issues of
   the Linux Gazette(tar-ed and gzip-ed) so that us (the readers) can
   download and browse at our leisure? If not, would it be too much
   trouble to do so? I hope I'm not imposing too much, but I am on a
   shared phone line, and much as I would like to stay on the net all day
   (it's tempting), I can't. Thanks for *any* help!
   
   --Sunit Das
   
     (No problem. tar files are available, I've just been having
     technical difficulties -- they were unreadable. At any rate John
     Fisk sent us new files that are now up at
     ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg/. Also, our issue 10 file,
     lg_issue10.tar.gzp and all issues (1-10) file,

   Subject: Suggestion: Search Engine
   From: "Johannes Norinder" dante@inferno.skurup.se 
   
   
   My suggestion is that you ought to have some kind of simple search
   engine so that you easily can search for phrases within one or all of
   the issues of LG. As is it's hard to know if you've covered Iomegas
   Zipdrive, for example.
   
   Otherwise thanks for a great service.
   
   Johannes Norinder
   
     (I agree. In fact it's something that I have already thought about.
     There is a search engine for Linux Journal, and I will probably use
     the same one for the Gazette. However, it means doing a lot of
     front end work to get it set up. When I'll have time to do this is
     not certain, but it is definitely on the list. --Editor)

   i got it to help me learn unix
   which it has helped a lot on
   but i have found it to be totally awesome in its own right
   
   
   it is almost cliche but nothing in any commercial sense has
   managed to pull together in a near utopian ( except for bugs )
   environment a cooperative effort of people worldwide
   
   
   it just shows what people can do when they work together

   well this site is just another example of this cooperation

   Subject: Linux Gazette
   From: Bill Cronk bcronk@nvl.army.mil 
   
   
   I am very glad to see a new issue put out. I was sad thinking that it
   had gone by the wayside.
   
   I would like to see a section of tips and tricks devoted towards the
   novice user who needs to learn the tricks to setting up hardware,
   software and all the other things that come along. I remember when the
   first Byte magazine came out and for the longest time there were
   articles on hardware and software for the novices. After a while that
   ended as people grew up and demanded more in depth articles. I would
   think that most people would have a hard time finding those back
   issues. In the case of the Gazette all the back issues will most
   likely be archived and if a basic index was published once or twice a
   year many new people to the world of Linux would have all kinds of
   useful tips and tricks to read through.
   
   Either way I enjoy reading the Gazette and will look forward to new
   issues. I wish you success in publishing the Gazette.
   
   In the future, maybe the far future, I will be able to provide an
   article now and then on some hardware and software items related to
   laboratory instrumentation interfacing and controlling of automated
   test equipment.
   
   Best wishes,
   Bill

   Wondering if there are any copies of the Gazette in HTML format with
   DOS filenames? I would like to set up a personal mirror of all issues
   on a DOS machine that I use regularly but unTARring the files from the
   FTP site is fruitless because the filenames are made DOS compliant and
   the links no longer match what is in the directory.
   
   I basically want my "site" to exactly mirror the SSC pages.
   
   Thanks for any help you can provide.

   From: Paul Bingman <paul@edgewood.net> 
   
   
   I suspect many/most of you have seen the new logo promoted by Linux
   Journal, that can be licensed for $1 a year, to show that your
   software or hardware product works with Linux. See:
   http://www.linuxjournal.com/Morelj/cool.html
   
   
   What is a very pleasant surprise is to see that logo starting to
   appear in the mainstream trade press. On page 41 of the September 16,
   1996, InfoWorld, is a half-page Equinox ad for their multiport serial
   cards. The COOL logo is the first one displayed, before Windoze,
   Novell, or SCO.

   Subject: LG : french translation + mirroring ?
   From: Patrick Mevzek <Patrick.Mevzek@Babbage.espci.fr> 
   To: fiskjm@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu
   
   
   Hi,
   
   I discovered your Linux Gazette some months ago, and it's great and
   very interesting. I've discovered Linux a little before, because I
   will need to install here at my school (you know I'm only a student
   like you ;-) !!) a small LAN of computers for students, with PC (Win
   95) and one LINUX-PC (which will be a firewall-mailhost-webserver,
   etc...). So I'm quite interested with everything in relation with
   Linux.
   
   In fact, I can propose you to translate the LG in French. I would be
   very pleased to do that. But I can promise you I will always have
   enough time to do it quickly, because first I'm a student, and
   therefore I've exams, (you know that...), and second, like I said
   before, I have to work a lot to install students'LAN.
   
   So, let me know if I can help you that way !!
   
   BTW, because I will be the maintainer of the web server of the
   students too, it could be possible, somewhat in January or February 97
   to start mirroring the LG, here at the ESPCI. I can't promise you big
   things, because mainly in 3 years I won't be in that school anymore,
   and I can't say that the next webserver maintainer will keep mirroring
   LG !! I hope to hear from you soon

     as SSC is now handling the Linux Gazette. I think it would be
     wonderful if you were to translate the LG into French, whenever you
     have time. It would certainly give the Gazette a wider French
     audience. We have very liberal copying requirements, especially if
     you are a mirror site (virtually none). We always welcome another
     mirror. Thanks for your interest. -- Editor)

   Subject: Tcl/Tk tips NOT IN Welch's Book
   
   
   I see that you just got hooked with Tcl/Tk.
   
   I found an *OLD* way of interfacing C program with Tk scripts, which
   is not documented in Welch's Book.
   
   What is it? Pipe!
   
   My C prog (parent) create two pipes to communicate with the Tk prog
   (child). The Tk prog only need to use stdin and stdout without knowing
   that this is controlled by the C prog. This provides a much easier way
   than the interface procedures described in Welch.
   
   Attached here are my C prog and my Tk prog. If you think this is worth
   writing a full article, please let me know. I will do that for the
   Gazette. :)
   
   Cheers

  PERL CONTROL M TRICK



Date: Wed, 4 Sep 1996 17:02:40 -0700 (PDT)

From: Jonathan Gross <jong@ssc.com>

Subject: Perl Tip




I read the most recent issue of the gazette, and the control M
issue caught my eye. Using vi or emacs is great, but if you have more than
one file, you can do this:

perl -pi.bak -e 's/\r//g;' filelist

FYI.

  ANOTHER EMACS CONTROL M TRICK



Date: Thu, 05 Sep 1996 13:34:09 -0700

From: Earl Stutes <estutes@eas.com>

Subject: $.02 emacs tip




Here is the way I handle the ^M in files.
Put this in your .emacs:

(defun dos-unix ()
  (interactive)
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (while (search-forward "\r" nil t) (replace-match "")))
(defun unix-dos ()
  (interactive)
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (while (search-forward "\n" nil t) (replace-match "\r\n")))

IP don't usually bind these to keys, but you certainly could.  When you
call the function M-xdos-unix, it will delete all of the delete all of
the <CR> characters in the file.  And of course the other function will
put them back.

  X TERM TITLEBAR FUNCTION



Date: Fri, 06 Sep 1996 17:53:00 -0600

From: "Michael J. Hammel" <mjhammel@emass.com>

Subject: Gazette #9 comments -- xterm title bar function




Nice job on the new Linux Gazette!  I'm just scanning it and had a few
notes I thought I'd pass to you.



In the mail, there are a couple of things.  Jim Murphy says that the
"-print" option to find is necessary to get output from the find command and
follows that up with "get used to it, its *nix".  Well, he's part right.
Linux does require this.  However, any users who work on other Unix
boxes will find slight differences in some of the common CLI commands
(CLI is "command line interface").  For example, "find" on Solaris does
not require the -print option to get output.  Just food for thought.



Second, I have an xterm title bar function that people might find
useful.  I'll give the code first, then explain what it does:



In your .bashrc (or .kshrc - note this only works on ksh style shells)
add the following:

HOSTNAME=`uname -n`
if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ] && [ "$0" = "-bash" ]
then
   ilabel () { echo -n "^[]1;$*^G"; }
   label () { echo -n "^[]2;$*^G"; }
   alias stripe='label $HOSTNAME - ${PWD#$HOME/}'
   alias stripe2='label $HOSTNAME - vi $*'
   cds () { "cd" $*; eval stripe; }
   vis () { eval stripe2; "vi" $*; eval stripe;}
   alias cd=cds
   alias vi=vis
   eval stripe
   eval ilabel "$HOSTNAME"
fi

This does three things (as long as you're in an xterm and running bash):
    1. when the xterm is first opened, the name of the current host is
       displayed in the title bar.
    2. when you cd to a directory, the current path is displayed in the
       xterm title bar with the users $HOME directory stripped off the
       front end of the path (to save some space when you're somewhere in
       your own directory tree). The path is preceded by the current
       hosts network name.
    3. when you use vi to edit a file the name of the file is displayed
       in the title bar along with the current hosts name. When you exit
       your vi session, the title bar reverts to the "hostname - path"
       format described in #2 above.



I found this very useful for all my ksh based systems because it
removed the path from my shell prompt, thus saving me space for prompt
commands.  Since bash is a ksh compatible shell, this works quite
well on standard Linux systems.



Hope everyone finds this useful.

  MORE ON COMMENTING CODE IN VI



Date: Mon, 09 Sep 1996 22:23:25 -0400

From: Jeff Blaine <jblaine@nda.com>

Subject: $0.02 tip - More on commenting code in vi




I'm generally ON the code I want to comment, so instead of
having to find out line numbers and then perform a substitution
on those lines to insert # characters, I just map my # key
to "go to the beginning of the current line, go into
insert mode, insert a # and a space, exit insert mode, go
down one line"



You can map your # key this way (or whatever key you want
to assign it to, but be careful) by putting the following
in your .exrc file:

map # I# ^[j

That "^[" is created by typing Ctrl-v and then hitting ESC,
so you literally type:

map<SPACE>#<SPACE>I#<SPACE><Ctrl-v><ESC>j




Then all you have to do to go comment-crazy is find where you want
to start and hold down your # key.

  MORE X TERM TITLE TRICK 2



Date: Sun, 08 Sep 1996 23:38:31 -0500

From: the Edward Blevins
<thedward@mail.utexas.edu> 

Subject: Re:XTerm Title Trick 2




In issue #9 of LG, one of the two cent tips is about how to put the
hostname in the title of your xterm. It mentions precmd for csh,
but not the bash equivalent. The way I do this in bash is as
follows:

  if [ $TERM = 'xterm' ]
  then export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne
"\033]2;"`whoami`@`hostname`"\007"'
  fi

this can just go in your .bashrc, lots of fun. I add the whoami, because
I am a sysadmin, and its a convienient way to tell if I am
root, in addition to the '#' on the prompt. Another variation I use
sometimes is : "`whoami`@`hostname`:`pwd`" then I can remove the path
from my prompt.



ps the LG is GREAT! Keep up the good work. Thank you very much!

  BASH QUICK TIP



Date: Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:59:41 +1000

From: Jeremy Laidman
<JPLaidman@ACSLink.net.au>

Subject: Bash Quick tip




Issue 8 had a 2c tip "There and Back!" describing a neat way to
change between two directories quickly.  The method was to
use "cd ~-" which will set the working directory to the
previous one you were in.



Bash (and several other shells I've tested) will do this without
the tilde, ie "cd -".  This saves me two keystrokes (including the
shift key).



Cheers

  NEAT RED HAT MANAGEMENT TRICK



Date: Mon, 16 Sep 1996 01:33:51 -0400 (EDT)

From: Mike Acar
<mike@contract.kent.edu>

Subject: Neat Red Hat management trick




Well, it's not really a trick per se.
If you're like me, you make an attempt to keep your Red Hat system
current- at least, in some respects. Tonight, looking at a man page which
mentioned Linux 0.99.11 brought to mind the thought that I should upgrade
my aging Red Hat 2.0 installation to something more current; fast on its
heels was a curiousity about just what I have taken from where. So with a
little bit of shell-play and some suggestions from my friend, the
following was produced:

rpm -qai | grep Dist | awk -F': ' '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c

This will tell you all the distributions you have installed RPMs from,
and the number of RPMs from each.

  MORE ON FIND AND ALTERNATIVES



Date: Sat, 14 Sep 1996 19:50:55 -0400 (EDT)

From: Bill Duncan
<bduncan@beachnet.org>

Subject: find tip...




Hi Jim Murphy.

Saw your "find" tip in issue #9, and thought you might like a quicker method.
I don't know about other distributions, but Slackware and Redhat
come with the GNU versions of locate(1) and updatedb(1) which use
an index to find the files you want.  The updatedb(1) program should
be run once a night from the crontab facility.  To ignore certain
sub-directories (like your /cdrom) use the following syntax for the
crontab file:

41 5 * * *  updatedb --prunepaths="/tmp /var /proc /cdrom" > /dev/null 2>&1

This would run every morning at 5:41am, and update the database with
filenames from everywhere but the subdirectories (and those below) the
ones listed.



To locate a file, just type  "locate filename".  The filename can also
do partial matching.  The search only takes a few seconds typically, and
I have tens of thousands of files.



The locate(1) command also has regular expression matching, but I often
just pipe it through agrep(1)  (a faster grep)  to narrow the search if
I want.  Thus:

  locate locate | agrep -v man

..would exclude the manpage for example, and only show me the binary
and perhaps the sources if I had them online.  (The -v flag excludes
the pattern used as an argument.)  Or the binary alone along
with a complete directory listing of it with the following command:

  ls -l `locate locate | agrep bin`

The find(1) command is a great "swiss-army knife" (and actually not
that bad once you get used to it), but for the 90% of the cases where
you just want to search by filename, the locate(1) command is *far*
faster, and much easier to use.

  PICO CONTROL M TRICK

From: Peter <pb@europa.com>

Subject: Easier ^M removal with Pico




        I've been using this trick for a long time .. its a lot easier then
defining macros in Emacs, too.  All it requires is a recent copy of the
Pico editor.



        Load the file you wish to strip ^Ms from, make a small change in the
file (like hitting the space bar, then delete), and save it.  No more ^Ms!

  YET ANOTHER EMACS CONTROL M TRICK



Date: Tue, 24 Sep 1996 19:26:10 -0700

From: Dan Gunter <dang@hooked.net>

Subject: re: emacs ^M trick



I'm new to emacs, so I use a very simple trick to search & replace on
special characters: I cut or copy them into the paste buffer, then
Meta-% and hit Control-Y to yank them back into the minibuffer.  This
isn't elegant, but it's very easy to remember, and seems to work for
everything.

  LINUX TRADEMARK: LET'S FIX IT.
  
   
   
    From: Paul Bingman paul@edgewood.portland.or.us
   
   
   As you are no doubt aware, some (insert your favorite deragatory
   epithet) has trademarked the name "Linux" is now out trying to collect
   from everyone they can.
   
   An intellectual property attorney friend of mine, G. Gervaise Davis
   III, is offering to get this trademark killed pro bono, if we can
   cover the expenses. His opinion, not having seen the original papers
   filed for the trademark, is that the original has absolutely no legal
   standing, and will probably be killed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
   Office as soon as we make the proper legal moves.
   
   Please forward this email to anyone/everyone. I'm especially
   interested in hearing from anyone who has received a collection
   letter, and also from Linus or someone else who can direct us to where
   the trademark should rightfully go. Also, this effort should be
   coordinated nationally or globally.

     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
  SOFT BRAILLE FOR LINUX: BRLTTY 1.0.1
  
   
   
    The official release of BRLTTY, a software system to allow access to
   the console of a Unix system for users of soft Braille displays, has
   been announced.
   
   BRLTTY currently runs under Linux (kernel version 1.1.92 or later) on
   a PC or DEC Alpha.
   
   The package has been uploaded to sunsite.unc.edu in the directory
   /pub/Linux/Incoming. It is expected to move to
   /pub/Linux/system/Access at some later date (please note the move from
   /pub/Linux/utils/console).
   
   FEATURES
     * Full implementation of the standard screen review facilities.
     * A wide range of additional optional features, including blinking
       cursor and capital letters, screen freezing for leisurely review,
       attribute display to locate highlighted text, hypertext links,
       etc.
     * `Intelligent' cursor routing. This allows easy movement of the
       cursor in text editors etc. without moving the hands from the
       Braille display.
     * A cut & paste function. This is particularly useful for copying
       long filenames, complicated commands etc.
     * An on-line help facility.
     * Support for multiple Braille codes.
     * Modular design allows relatively easy addition of drivers for
       other Braille displays, or even (hopefully) porting to other
       Unix-like platforms.

  SPRITEFIELD - A SPRITE LIBRARY FOR QT/X11
  
   
   
    The SpriteField Class Set is a collection of classes supporting
   multiple simultaneous flicker-free displays of efficiently redrawn
   continuous and non-continuous animated areas with the Qt GUI Toolkit.
   Animated areas are two-dimensional rectangular areas upon which
   two-dimensional masked raster images are in motion. Applications vary
   from computer games to simulations. Qt 0.99 is required. Full sources
   and an precompiled example program are included and can be found at:

  TEAMROOMS - INTERNET GROUPWARE ENVIRONMENT FOR LINUX
  
   
   
    Mark Roseman, University of Calgary CPSC, announced the first public
   beta release of TeamRooms, an Internet groupware environment that lets
   you work together with colleagues in real-time or asynchronously,
   using Unix, Mac and Windows.
   
   TeamRooms provides "shared spaces" on the Internet allowing groups to
   share information. These electronic team rooms provide places to meet
   in real-time, or a common locale to leave information for other
   collaborators. TeamRooms combines real-time groupware technologies
   such as shared whiteboards, chat rooms, and customizable groupware
   applets with a persistent work environment.
   
   Information on downloading is available on our Web site:
   http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/projects/grouplab/teamrooms/

2. Introducción

   
   
   Hola futuro contertulio con feddi y bt :-)
   
   Si te has decidido a instalar este paquete, toda mi enhorabuena. No es
   muy complicado, sólo puede que tengas problemas de permisos. Los
   fuentes incluídos en este paquete ya han sido parcheados para que
   funcionen un poco mas fino.
   
   Tanto fmbedit como bt tienen pequeños problemas, no seas muy criticón
   y piensa que no has pagado nada por ellos. Contribuye, si corriges
   errores, no te los quedes para ti, compártelos, envíame parches o
   comentarios, de esta forma haremos que este soft vaya a más. Un
   consejo: no lo uses desde X, la base de datos de terminales no está
   muy fina, me he propuesto corregirla, seguro que un día lo pondré como
   parche :-) (Antes decía que sería el próximo :-DDDDDDDDDDD)
   
   Tengo que agradecer :
   
     * Alfonso Belloso : 2:344/17.2 (si me acuerdo bien)
     * Jose Luis Sanchez : 2:346/207.17 (Este seguro)
     * Pablo Gómez : 2:341/43.12 (Correcciones en este fichero y los
       scripts para la automatización del área personal)
     * Javier Ruberte : 2:346/401.50
     * Jose Carlos Gutierrez : 2:341/45.17 (Scrits de compilación de
       nodelist)
     * Carlos Terrón : 2:345/402.23 (Parche para que ftoss reconozca
       mayúsculas/minúsculas)
       
   
   
   Al final de este fichero encontrarás unos cuantos mensajes, todos
   enviados con feddi, con algunos trucos.

3. Instalación del FEddi

3.1 Instalación del usuario fido.

   
   
   Vamos a instalar fido como usuario de correo, puedes darle otro
   nombre.
   
   Entremos en materia.
   
   En este documento cuando veas ~/ se refiere al home del usuario.
   
     * fichero /etc/passwd Incluye la siguiente línea :

fido::2004:300::/home/fido:/bin/bash
     * fichero /etc/group Incluye la siguiente línea :

fido::300:uucp,fido,root

3.2 Paquetes necesarios

   
   
   Necesitas :
   
     * perl, haz

ls /usr/bin/perl
   Si no existe, instálalo, discos D
     * ncurses, haz

ls /usr/lib/libncurses.a
   Si no existe, instálalas, discos D
       
3.3 Configuración/instalación del mailer.

   
   
   Vete al directorio /FEddi-0.9pl5
   
    1. Edita el fichero Makefile, en la variable SRCDIR pon el path donde
       estén tus fuentes, ej:

SRCDIR=/root/trabajo/mailer/FEddi-dev
    2. En la línea NODEPRG = añade al principio nlfunct.o sino, no
       compila.
    3. make
    4. Si tienes este error :

ncurses.h: No such file or directory
   Haz :

ln -s /usr/include/ncurses/curses.h /usr/include/ncurses/ncurses.h
    5.

su root
make install
exit
    6. Parece que la utilidad de instalación no copia las utilidades a su
       directorio, haz lo siguiente :

cp utils/* ~/fnet/utility
    7. Hay que modificar unos cuantos ficheros :
          + Fichero printmsg


#!/bin/sh
cat | $HOME/fnet/utility/formatmsg | lpr
          + Fichero exportmsg


#!/bin/sh
if test $1 = "new"
  then
        cat | $HOME/fnet/utility/formatmsg > "$2"
  else
        cat | $HOME/fnet/utility/formatmsg >> "$2"
fi
    8. El directorio fnet se compone de lo siguiente :

./outbound
./msgbase
./copy
./log
./inbound
./utility
./nodelist
   Créate esos directorios y haz lo siguiente:

chown -R fido.fido fnet
    9. Fichero de configuración ~/.feddirc:
          + Permisos 644
          + Usuario/grupo fido.uucp

;
; This .feddirc was automatically created with config.user

   Puedes basarte en este fichero para configurar el tuyo, a mí me
       funciona sin problemas.
   10. Fichero ~/fnet/nodelist/fnlcrc

dial    34-6-   3
dial    34-6
dial    *

pointlist       ptlstr34
pointlist       eu_punto

nodelist        region34
nodelist        eu_nodos
   dial : Según tu zona 34-6 (Valencia), 34-1 (Madrid), 34-3 (Barcelona),
       etc... Con pointlist las diversas listas de puntos, se pueden usar
       las listas de punto que nos vienen de las bbs sin transformar. Con
       nodelist las diversas listas de nodos, se pueden usar las listas
       de nodos que nos vienen de las bbs sin transformar. Nada más.
   11. Compilar las nodelist/pointlist Yo uso los siguientes scripts, son
       sencillos y funcionan.
          + fichero ~/fnet/nodelist/compila0 permisos 777

#!/bin/bash
unzip lista.zip
mv EU_NODOS* eu_nodos
mv EU_PUNTO* eu_punto
mv PTLSTR34* ptlstr34
mv REGION34* region34
mv SNETLIST* snetlist
mv SUBPTLST* subptlst
          + fichero ~/fnet/nodelist/compila1 permisos 777

#!/bin/bash
rm fnlc.*
fnlc
   Esto te compila las listas, si tienes problemas seguro que son de
       permisos, revisa tus ficheros, normalmente los binarios se
       instalan en /usr/bin
       
3.4 Comprobación y manejo.

   
   
   Prueba de correo, Busca un paquete de correo que tengas por MS/DOS lo
   pones en el directorio ~/fnet/inbound y haces
   

ftoss ; futility pack ; futility link

   
   
   Es de esta forma que tratarás siempre tu correo en entrada, ftoss crea
   automáticamente los folder correspondientes a tus áreas.
   

fmbedit

   
   
   Si todo va bien tendrás el correo correspondiente a ese paquete en tu
   pantalla :-)
   
   El editor es muy sencillo y muy bien documentado, se parece un poco al
   editor del fmail.
   
   Creas un mensaje en un área o dos y haces :
   

fscan

   
   
   Es de esta forma como tratarás siempre tu correo en salida.

4. Instalación del Binkley.

4.1 Configuracion/instalacion del caller

   
   
    1. Lo primero que tienes que hacer es : vete al directorio /bt haces

make
su root
make install
   deberás tener en /usr/bin:

-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     fido       238983 Sep 15 18:04 /usr/bin/bt
   y en /usr/lib/binkley:

-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root          742 Sep 16 10:04 binkley.cfg
-rw-r--r--   1 uucp     root          108 Sep 16 10:10 binkley.day

   Te puedes basar en este fichero, sólo tienes que adaptarlo a tus
       necesidades y quitar los (numerito).
          + (1), línea que vas a utilizar 1 COM1, 2 COM2, etc... (*)
          + (2), velocidad del puerto, 19200 si es una 16450
          + (3), cadena de inicialización de tu modem
          + (4), prefijo de llamada para tu bbs, ej : ATDP (pulso) o ATDT
            (tono)
          + (5), Tu seudonimo como aparece en la pointlist, sin los _
          + (6), Tu nombre tal y como aparece en la pointlist, sin los _
          + (7), Tu direccion fido principal fakenet telefono_de_la_bbs
          + (8), Tu palabra de paso y el boss, no te olvides de poner un
            ``!'' delante de tu palabra de paso.
          + (9), Subdominios, de tenerlos, se rigen por las mismas reglas
            que tu dominio principal.
          + (*) Puedes utilizar el 5, con ese abrirás /dev/modem,
            normalmente, /dev/modem es un symlink que apunta a /dev/cua0
            o /dev/cua1, (ln -s /dev/cua1 /dev/modem) por lo menos es así
            como lo tengo...
    3. Incluye la siguiente linea en tu ~/.profile

export BINKLEY=/usr/lib/binkley
   haz

. ~/.profile
   (esto sólo lo harás esta vez, la próxima vez que entres como fido ya
       tendrás la variable BINKLEY inicializada)
    4. Ejecuta

bt

4.2 Problemas

   
   
   Si tienes problemas, seguro que son de permisos o path mal definidos,
   revísalos.
   
    1. El error más común es :

cannot re-open logfile
   El propietario normalmente es : usuario.uucp. Los permisos : 664
    2. Otro error bastante común : Aquí te puede pasar que el tty que le
       has habilitado no tenga permisos adecuados, sobre todo si éste ha
       sido usado por el getty, normalmente debe tener permiso de
       lectura/escritura para todo el mundo. El error es :

tty port can not be initialised
   Solución:

chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0
   o ttyS1; (COM1: o COM2:).
    3. Para los que tengan RedHat :

ln -s /var/spool /usr

   
   
   Si te aparece una pantalla parecida al frodo puedes hacer lo siguiente
   :
   
   ALT-Y, llamará a tu bbs, dejará tu correo y cogerá el que tengas en
   ella. Luego sólo tienes que ejecutar los comandos, ya vistos, para
   tratar el correo.
   
   Si durante la transmisión del PRIMER fichero tienes la impresión de
   que se queda ``dormido'', aprieta la tecla ESC y se ``despertará''.
   
4.3 ``Templates''.

Hola All.

De momento el FEddi no viene demasiado documentado, asi que, despues de
algunas pruebas, por fin puedo hacer el mantenimiento de la base de mensajes.

        futility tool delete "age+15&&protect-&&new-" R34.LINUX
        futility pack

Con esto estamos borrando los mensajes con mas de 15 dias que no esten
protegidos y que ademas ya hayan sido leidos.
Si no poneis el nombre del area se tratarian todas. Lo que ocurre es que hay
algunas areas que dejo mas dias, lo que me obliga a poner una linea por cada
una, personalizandola a mi gusto.

Saludos.

Hola ALL!

He estando haciendo pruebas para conseguir lo del RE: con el soft de Linux y
ya he bajado mi primer fichero. Paso a explicar como lo he hecho por si sirve
para alguien y ademas por si lo hago mal que alguien me pueda corregir.

Primero escribo un Net normalmente a mi Sysop. Cuando he terminado de escribir
el mensaje salgo de el (Alt+x).
Estando sobre el mensaje, pulso (Alt+g) y se me abre una ventanita que
presenta unos datos. Una vez ahi pulso "Ins" y escribo el nombre del fichero
que deseo bajar; cuando termino pulso "Esc".
Con esto ya debe funcionar, la proxima vez que llames te bajara el fichero.
Al menos a mi me ha funcionado asi.

¿Algun comentario?

Bye,
  Javier

con esto lo que ocurre es que al insertar un net, en lugar de escribir el To:
apretas el "Avpg" o "Repg" y te van saliendo los distintos nombres. Como veras
yo incluso he añadido alguna direccion de internet que uso a veces. el primer
campo creo que son como teclas abreviadas para hacer una llamada directa a esa
linea. No recuerdo ahora como se hace pero es facil y esta en el man feddi.

No se si me falta por decir algo. Si te parece buena la informacion pon algo
en el feddi.como; si crees que falta algo dimelo y te paso lo que haga falta.

Talavista.

5.5 Automatización: El área personal.

From: All
Subj: Area personal en FEDDI, la refinitiva ;-)
Send: 24 Jun 96  00:35:31
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hola All!

Bien, desde hace un tiempo estamos venga a darle vueltas a la posibilidad de
disponer en  FEDDI de un area personal que permita recibir en ella los
mensajes dirigidos a nosotros, recibidos en cualquier area, y sobre todo (ya
que lo anterior no es complicado) el poderlos responder comodamente,
enviandolos 'de regreso' a sus areas originales.

Con estos script que siguen, al menos Francisco Jose Montilla y el que
suscribe lo hemos conseguido.

En primer lugar, se trata de crear el area que luego va a servir como
PERSONAL. Esto se puede hacer del siguiente modo:

(Como usuario fido)

$ cd ~/msgbase
$ mkdir +PERSONAL
$ cp +R34.LINUX/* +PERSONAL/

(PERSONAL es el nombre que quereis dar al area personal) Comprobad que los
permisos y dueños del nuevo directorio y los archivos que contiene son
iguales a los que teneis en otras areas. Corregidlo si no es asi.

Despues, de cara a vaciarla de mensajes, haced:

$ futility "+delete" "all+" PERSONAL
$ futility pack PERSONAL

Si volveis a invocar fmbedit, vereis que teneis un nuevo area, llamado...
PERSONAL! :-) Magia? :-)

Ahora ya tenemos la base. Siguiente parte: Copiar los mensajes que llegan al
sistema, nuevos, y a nuestro nombre. Esto se hace (casi) automaticamente.

Si creamos un archivo asi:

                                      ,,,
                                     (o o)  File: ~/msgbase/tosspath
---*reiss*------*schnippel*------oOO--(_)--OOo-------*knabber*-----*fetz*---

copy    t"Pablo Gomez" PERSONAL

---*reiss*------*schnippel*--------------------------*knabber*-----*fetz*---

Ya estaria. Evidentemente, habreis de sustituir mi nombre (Pablo Gomez) por el
vuestro y PERSONAL por el nombre de vuestro area personal. Cada vez que
corramos ftoss, este se va a encargar de copiar al area personal los mensajes
dirigidos a nosotros.

Aqui merece la pena hacer un comentario. Y es que esto va a copiar tambien los
mensajes a nuestro nombre recibidos en NETMAIL. A mi parecer, esto es un
absurdo, ya que realmente el area NETMAIL ya es un area personal. Hasta donde
se, no es posible modificar el comando para que no los copie. Por ello mas
adelante tendremos que hacer un pequeño ajuste.

Esto es un trozo (el importante ;-)) del script que corro al recibir correo.
                                      ,,,
                                     (o o)  File: ~/bin/mimport
---*reiss*------*schnippel*------oOO--(_)--OOo-------*knabber*-----*fetz*---
#!/bin/sh

# Para la gestion del area personal
PERSAREA=PERSONAL

# Importar correo
ftoss

#
# Feeding area personal
# Acabamos de repartir los mensajes, generando los duplicados necesarios
# en PERSONAL. Sin embargo, deseamos borrar los mensajes recién copiados al
# area PERSONAL que provienen del area de NETMAIL
#
futility tool "+delete" \
  "new+&&text+\*\*\* ftoss: copied from NETMAIL" $PERSAREA


# reconstruir threads
futility pack
futility link

#[...]
---*reiss*------*schnippel*--------------------------*knabber*-----*fetz*---

Tened cuidado: la linea 'futility tool ...' y la "new..." son una sola. El
cometido es borrar esos mensajes de NETMAIL innecesarios.

Seguimos. Ahora el modo de manejo. En el area PERSONAL tengo mensajes que
contienen una linea tal que:

*** ftoss: copied from R34.LINUX

(por ejemplo) :-)

Contesto (sobre el mismo area PERSONAL) el mensaje sin preocuparme de nada,
_EXCEPTO_ de no borrar esa linea, que posteriormente servira de 'testigo' para
que el mensaje se conteste en el area adecuada.

Luego, cuando exporto correo, corro el siguiente script:
                                      ,,,
                                     (o o)  File: ~/bin/mexport
---*reiss*------*schnippel*------oOO--(_)--OOo-------*knabber*-----*fetz*---
#!/bin/sh

USER_BIN_DIR=/home/fido/bin
LOCAL_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin
# Nombre del area personal
PERSAREA=PERSONAL

# Nombre del usuario
USERNOM="Pablo Gomez"

# Archivo temporal de salida
OUTFILE=/tmp/persanswr




# Extraccion de mensajes del area personal que esten pendientes de proceso
# y posterior marcado como 'sent'
#
futility tool "display" "attribute-se&&from+Pablo Gomez" $PERSAREA > $OUTFILE
futility tool "+se" "attribute-se&&from+Pablo Gomez" $PERSAREA

# distribucion a las nuevas areas...
awk -f $USER_BIN_DIR/persreply.awk < $OUTFILE

# scan de la base de mensajes
#
$LOCAL_BIN_DIR/fscan
---*reiss*------*schnippel*--------------------------*knabber*-----*fetz*---

Y la linea del 'awk' incluye un fichero persreply.awk que es este:

                                      ,,,
                                     (o o)  File: ~/bin/persreply.awk

        if (estado==1) {
                viejoestado=2
                estado=3
                replyarea=$NF
### Modificar:

        print "*** pers_area: Copiado desde area PERSONAL" >> "/tmp/tmpreply"
        }
        }

/^#To: / {
        user=""
        for (n=2; n <= NF; n++)  {
                user=sprintf("%s %s ",user,$n)
        }
        }
# Evitaremos que se escriban las lineas siguientes:
/^#Area: / {
        viejoestado=estado
        estado=3
        }

/^#@To: / {
        viejoestado=estado
        estado=3
        }



# siempre, excepto en los casos descritos arriba...
estado != 3{
#####
#
# ATENCION!: Modificar igual que arriba.
#  Siento la chapucilla, pero no he conseguido resolverlo.
#
        print $0 >> "/tmp/tmpreply"
        }
# Reponer el estado anterior
estado==3 { estado=viejoestado }


/^###MESSAGE_END###/{
        if (estado==2) {
                close (outputfile)
                comando=sprintf("cat %s | futility addmsg %s",outputfile,
replyarea)
                system(comando)
                system(borracmd)
                estado=1
                replyarea=""
        }
        }

END     {
        system(borracmd)
        }
---*reiss*------*schnippel*--------------------------*knabber*-----*fetz*---

Tened cuidado: hay lineas cortadas (se ven) y hay una doble chapucilla que no
he sabido resolver. En vez de definir arriba todas las variables, hay una,
outputfile, que he tenido que redefinir a mitad de script, como constante, ya
que no he sabido hacerlo mejor. He intentado pasar una variable,
entrecomillada de distintas formas o no... y no lo consigo. Quiza alguno nos
eche una mano.

Esta probado con varios mensajes simultaneos, aunque creo que de momento no he
fallado nunca cargandome la linea del ***ftoss...

Para la proxima. Espero que os sea util. Estare encantado de recibir
comentarios, mejoras, etc.

    by Phil Hughes, WA6SWR, phil@ssc.com
    
      Copyright (c) 1996
      
      Published in Issue 10 of the Linux Gazette
      
   
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
   This year's ARRL/TAPR sponsored conference on Digital Communications
   was in Seattle on September 20-22. Being a ham, a packet fan and 18
   miles away from the conference, I decided to attend. I also offered to
   bring some Linux Journal magazines to give away. By the end of the
   conference "some" had become about 100.
   
   The papers presented varied from very introductory material to a
   serious look at how to equalize group delay of IF filters. Many of the
   papers and one of the three workshops dealt with a system called
   Automatic Position Report System. For those not familiar with this, a
   GPS receiver is combined with a packet station to send out position
   reports.
   
   But, the purpose of this article is not to talk about the "ham
   content" of the conference (if you want more info on that, check out
   http://www.tapr.org/, but to talk about the L-word.
   
   In the first workshop (on APRS), Keith Sproul demonstrated both a
   Windows and a Mac version of the system, but regularly referenced the
   fact that a Linux version also existed. I was surprised (as there was
   no mention of a Sun version or any other Unix-like version), but I was
   now sure that Linux had infiltrated the ham packet radio community
   pretty seriously.
   
   The L-word then continued to come up in discussions with people. It
   varied from comments about installing Linux to how Linux became a
   significant part of a ham network. For example, in Barry McLarnon and
   Dennis Rosenauer's presentation on Wireless Networking Using the
   WA4DSY 56K RF Modem Technology, Barry said "Linux is the platform of
   choice". Later, when describing the Ottawa MAN (Metropolitan Area
   Network) he pointed out that their Internet server (hydra.carleton.ca)
   is a Linux box, and they, when talking about the packet gateway
   machine, said "It hasn't been converted to Linux yet."
   
   At the end of their presentation we had a chance to play with a
   wireless network set up in the room. The machine on one end of the 56K
   link was running Linux as was one downstream machine off the other
   end.
   
   All in all, the conference was good for Linux.

   Date: Wed, 11 Sep 1996 16:46:31 GMT
   From: Victoria Welch vikki@seastar.org
   Organization: Welch Research laboratories
   
   
   Mark A. Horton (mah@netmha.com) passed away Friday September 7, 1996.
   Cause currently unknown, but poor health is suspected. he did have a
   lot of health problems, although he never let them keep him down long,
   in so many ways he was such an inspiration!
   
   Having been through the rest of the *nixes, and knowing the subject
   well, he was one of the greatest proponents of Linux. His enthusiasm
   and willingness to help anyone at any time were his greatest gifts to
   the Linux community.
   
   His kindness, willingness to help others in many ways including Linux
   and his generosity will be missed by those of us that knew him and an
   example for all of us to strive for. For me personally, he was my best
   friend and mentor. He taught myself and *MANY* others much about the
   nuts and bolts of Linux in a joyous way that was informative and
   instructive and often most pleasantly humorous. Most any interaction
   with Mark was a good time.
   
   Having spent a great many hours with him personally as well as on the
   phone, he made is very clear that he didn't want any morose happenings
   should anything ever happen to him, There will be a party by his
   friends to honor that request sometime in the near future. Will plan
   on celebrating his contributions and the many wonderful things that
   there are to be remembered about him. He was one of the true good guys
   and his joyous, creative, tenacious, encouraging spirit will be missed
   by those that knew him. To the many that knew Mark and to the many who
   didn't, hoist one to one of the greats! He will be missed.
   
   Thanks & Take care, Vikki.

     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
   Normally, users of PS/2 type mice have a problem in that a PS/2 type
   mouse cannot simultaneously be shared among different applications
   such as gpm (selection) and XFree86. That was until the discovery of a
   tiny utility called, mconv2. Mconv2 allows several programs to use a
   PS/2 type mouse at the same time.
   
   
   The mconv2 utility also supports the use of a PS/2 type mouse with
   applications that do not understand the PS/2 mouse protocol, but
   understand the microsoft serial mouse protocol (such as svgalib). This
   document only descrdibes the sharing of the PS/2 type mouse - not its
   use as a microsoft type mouse - for information on this, read the
   README file included with the mconv2 distribution.
   
   
   Installing and using mconv2 is VERY simple :-
   
   
    1. Getting mconv2
       Mconv2 can be downloaded from a variety of Linux archive sites. I
       got my copy from
       
       
       http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Misc/mconv2.tar.gz
       
       
    2. Extracting Distribution
       Mconv2 is distributed as a compressed (gz) tar archive. Hence, it
       needs to be extraceted in a suitable directory before it can be
       installed. I used the /usr/src directory, but any directory will
       do. Copy the mconv2 distribution file (mconv2.tar.gz) to the
       selected working directory, eg. /usr/src (or the directory you
       care to extract it in) as follows :-

    cp mconv2.tar.gz /usr/src

   Go to the working directory and extract the mconv2 archive, as follows
       :-

    cd /usr/src
    tar -zxvf mconv2.tar.gz

   This will create a subdirectory called mconv2 containing,
          + the mconv2 source code - mconv2.c
          + a binary compiled mconv2 executable - mconv2
          + supporting documentation files - mconv2.lsm and README
   
       
       
    3. To compilie mconv2, or not
       Together with the source and supporting documentation, the mconv2
       distribution also comes with a pre-built binary of the program.
       This can be used as-is or the program can be recompiled very
       easily, as follows :-
       
       

    gcc -O2 -o mconv2 mconv2.c

   
       
       
    4. Installing the mconv2 binary Copy the pre-built, or newly made,
       mconv2 binary file (mconv2) to an appropriate directory for
       executing binarys from - I use /usr/local/bin.
       
       

    cp mconv2 /usr/local/bin

    5. Builiding a fifo for the PS/2 mouse
       Create a fifo device (pseudo mouse driver) for the PS/2 mouse, as
       follows :-
       
       

    mkfifo -m 666 /dev/ps2mouse

   
       
       
    6. Using mconv2
       Before running any programs using the PS/2 mouse, mconv2 should be
       run first and other programs needing the mouse, should be
       configured to use the PS/2 pseudo device, /dev/ps2mouse. It is
       probably best, to start mconv2 from the /etc/rc.d.rc.local file
       with the following command :-

    echo -n "Runnig mconv2 .... "
    /usr/local/bin/mconv2 /dev/psaux -ps2 /dev/ps2mouse &
    echo "Done"

   NOTE :- this assumes your original mouse device was /dev/psaux
       
       
    7. Configuring other programms to use mconv2
       As mentioned in the point above, other programs requiring the PS/2
       mouse must be configured to use the mconv2 pseudo mouse device -
       /dev/ps2mouse.
       
       
       Examples :-
       
       
          + To set up gpm, to use this pseudo device, invoke it as
            follows :-

    gpm -t ps2 -m /dev/ps2mouse &

        NOTE :- the -m option tells gpm what mouse device to use
            
            
          + To set up XFree86 to use the pseudo device, modify the
            Pointer section of the XF86Config file to set the mouse
            device to /dev/ps2mouse as follows :-

    Section "Pointer"
      Protocol    "PS/2"
      Device      "/dev/ps2mouse"


   Enjoy the PS/2 mouse sharing. My thanx to Frode Fjeld
   frodef@stud.cs.uit.no for developing the mconv2 distribution.

  NETDAY96 AND LINUX
  
   
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
   Date: Sat, 14 Sep 1996 08:33:11 -0500 (CDT)
   From: "Paul L. Rogers" RogersPL@datasync.com
   
   
   Good Morning,
   
   Late last week I became aware of the national NetDay96 project and
   volunteered at my daughter's school. During the weekend, I realized
   that this was an opportunity to involve the Linux community in a
   project that could not only benefit our local schools, but expose new
   classes of people to Linux.
   
   If this topic is suitable for SSC's ventures to publicize, please help
   spread the word. For NetDay96, maybe something in the _Linux Gazette_
   could reach a few people in time to for them to make a contribution.
   If there is a NetDay97, perhaps an article in the _Linux Journal_
   reporting on NetDay96 with suggestions on how to promote Linux during
   such an event would be appropriate.
   
   Attached is a posting that recently (1996/09/13) appeared on
   comp.os.linux.announce.
   
   A data point: The October 1996 LJ arrived in Ocean Springs,
   Mississippi on Friday.
   
   I strongly agree with "Linux people, now is the time to strike." and
   have recently become much more aggressive in sharing my experiences
   with Linux. Would you be interested in an article providing guidelines
   and suggestions on how to promote Linux?
   
   Thank you for your time and if this project is not suitable for SSC,
   perhaps other opportunities will allow us to work together in the
   future.
   
   Paul...

   Paul L. Rogers http://www.netday96.com
   RogersPL@datasync.com Are you prepared for NetDay96?
   (601) 875-3779 Linux: It works for me.
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
  NETDAY96
  
   
   
   In the United States of America, preparations are under way for
   NetDay96. NetDay96 is a grass-roots effort to install the basic wiring
   required to make classrooms network ready.
   
   If Linux enthusiasts across the United States would participate in
   their local NetDay96 and be prepared to follow up with assistance in
   creating highly functional and reliable networks for our school
   systems, much favorable publicity could be generated for the Linux
   movement.
   
   This is an unique opportunity to expand the name recognition of Linux.
   
   
   The following steps describe how you can help:
     * Volunteer to help wire a school and wear a Linux T-Shirt to the
       event.
     * Be prepared to discuss the benefits (and limitations) of Linux.
     * Suggest that your Linux User's Group sponsors a school by funding
       a wiring kit. The cost of the wiring kit ranges from $339 to $376
       depending on the vendor.
     * Contact a local Linux-based Internet Service Provider and request
       their support for NetDay96.
       
   For more information on NetDay96 or to volunteer, feel free to visit
   their web site at http://www.netday96.com.
   
   Some guidelines can be found at
   http://www.li.org/NetDay96-guidelines.html 
   
   If you volunteer, please consider sharing your experiences and success
   stories with the community by sending them to li@li.org. We will post
   a report summarizing the success of this event.
   
   If you do not live in the United States, you may want to consider
   organizing a similar project for your community.

   From mjhammel@csn.net
   Subject: Re: Gimp Tips & Tricks
   Date: Thu, 5 Sep 1996 22:39:21 -0600 (MDT)
   
   
   I have written a template for use by GIMP plug-in authors to write
   documentation that will look good and be fairly uniform for our users.
   There is also a detailed explanation that goes with it. The
   explanation is, in a sense, a general explanation on how to use the
   LinuxDoc package, since that's what we've decided to use for the GIMP
   Documentation Project.
   
   You can take a look at both the template and the explanation at:
   http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel/gimp/gdp/gdp.html (look under the
   plug-ins documentation section). The explanation text follows below.

           AN EXPLANATION OF THE SAMPLE PLUG-IN SGML SOURCE TEMPLATE
                                       
   Copyright 1996
   by Michael J. Hammel mjhammel@csn.net
   Last Updated: 09/04/96
   
   This is a long page, but don't let that scare you. Creating your
   documents in SGML and using LinuxDoc tools to create your HTML, GNU
   Info, Man Page, or other formats is really pretty simple. This page
   just happens to be fairly thorough in explaining how to get it all
   done.
   
   There are 6 sections in the SGML template:
     * The Title Information Section
     * The Introduction Section
     * The Features Section
     * The Dialog Box Section
     * The Examples Section
     * The Notes Section
       
   Each section is described below. Along with these, there are a number
   of things you should be aware of when writing your document:
     * The Table of Contents
     * Section markers
     * Forcing new paragraphs
     * Comments
     * Lists
     * HTML or other format Specific tags
     * Notes about creating documents in the various formats
       
   As far as LinuxDoc itself is concerned, here are some things you might
   want to be aware of:
     * Where to get the LinuxDoc software:
          + The Home Page for LinuxDoc.
          + FTP Sites:
               o
                 ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/people/gregh/linuxdoc-sgml/li
                 nuxdoc-sgml-1.5.tar.gz
               o
                 ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/docs/linuxdoc-sgml-1.5.tar
                 .gz
               o
                 ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/text/linuxdoc-sgml-
                 1.5.tar.gz
               o ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/people/gregh/linuxdoc-sgml -
                 Uptodate patches to version 1.5.
     * How to test your SGML
     * Updates I've made to the LinuxDoc package
       
   If you're interested in testing your SGML source, you should grab a
   copy of the LinuxDoc package at (put ftp site here).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
The Title Information Section

   This section has 6 tags in it:
     * article
     * title
     * author
     * inst
     * date
     * abstract
       
   All of these tags are mandatory and must be placed in this order.
   
   The article tag has no other text associated with it. It is put on a
   line by itself and is a marker to the SGML parser telling the parser
   what kind of document is to be created.
   Example:

        <article>

   
   
   The title tag is the name of the Plug-In. This must be one line long
   and on the same line as the title tag.
   Example:

        <title>The Sparkle Plug-In

   
   
   The author tag identifies the author of the Plug-In. This should
   simply be the name of the developer. Along with this is a tag which
   identifies the email address of the author. The code for the email
   address looks similar to the following.
   Example:

        <author>Michael J. Hammel
        <htmlurl url="mailto:user@some.net" name="&lt;user@some.net&gt;">

   
   
   Just substitute the appropriate email address. Note that the use of
   &amplt; and &ampgt; are required. These get translated into the
   less-than and greater-than signs, respectively, in the output.
   
   The inst tag is just the current version number of the Plug-In source
   code.
   Example:

        <inst>Version 1.0

   
   
   The date tag is the date that the source code was last updated. The
   format of the text that goes with this tag should look like the
   following:
   Example:

        <date>Last Updated: 09/01/96

   
   
   The abstract tag marks the beginning of a paragraph of text that
   describes, in general, what the Plug-In does. This is free formatted
   text and must be followed by the <abstract> tag.
   Example:

        <abstract>
                Some text goes here.
        </abstract>

   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
The Introduction Section

   This section contains two subsections:
     * Where to get the software
     * How to build the software
       
   Both of these are mandatory subsections.
   
   Example section header:

        <sect>Introduction
        <P>

   
   
   The Where to get the software subsetion is a URL (ftp or http address)
   for the source code. If a binary version is available, the binaries
   location should be listed with the this subsection.
   Example:

        <sect1>Where to get the software
        <P>
        The software can be retrieved from
        <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.some.net/dir/file.tar.gz"
        name="&lt;ftp://ftp.some.net/dir/file.tar.gz&gt;">

   
   
   The How to build the software subsetion is simple an explanation on
   how to build the software. Example:

        <sect1>How to build the software
        <P>
        Building the source should be fairly straight forward.
        Just make sure the LIBS= line points to the location of
        libgimp.a.  Also, a copy of gimp.h is included in the
        source.  You should really delete this and make gimp.h a
        symbollic link to your copy of gimp.h (wherever you're
        keeping that) so that the latest version of gimp.h is used.

   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
The Features Section

   The Features Section is an itemized list of the features that the
   plug-in provides. This should include, at a minimum, a listing of all
   the buttons, sliders, or input fields in the dialog box. A very brief
   description of the features can be included. This is desirable if the
   feature listed is not one that is readily apparent from the dialog
   box.
   
   Example:

        <sect>Features
        <P>
        <itemize>
                <item>Feature one
                <item>Feature two
                <item>Feature three
        </itemize>

   See the section titled Lists for a description on how to create lists
   using the template.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
The Dialog Box Section

   The Dialog Box Section describes the features found in the Plug-In's
   pop-up dialog box and explains how they effect images. This section is
   made up of an screen capture image (for the HTML formatted output
   files) of the dialog box, an numbered list of features, and a
   feature-by-feature breakdown. To start this section, use the
   followgin:

        <sect>The ... Dialog Box <label id="dialog">
        <P>

   Replace the three dots with the name of the Plug-In.
   
   After the section header, a list of features should be provided. The
   list will look something like this following:

        <itemize>
                <item><em><ref id="feature1" name="Feature One"></em>
                <item><em><ref id="feature2" name="Feature Two"></em>
                <item><em><ref id="feature3" name="Feature Three"></em>
        </itemize>

   The name tag is what will show up in the list. The id tag is a cross
   reference that you will use later. The <em> tags just cause the stuff
   inbetween to be put in italics.
   
   After you create the list, you should force a break after the image.
   This will only affect HTML output for now. This is the line you should
   add to force the break:

        <![%fmthtml; [ <? <BR clear="both"> > ]]>

   
   
   Now you should add the subsections that fully explain each feature.
   For the first item in the list above, you would add the following:

        <sect1>Feature One <label id="feature1">
        <P>
        This is the text explaining the first feature.

   The sect1 tag signifies you are starting a subsection. The label with
   its id gives this section a name that can be used as a
   cross-reference. We used this in the list of features earlier.
   
   You would have a subsection just like this for each feature in your
   dialog box.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
The Examples Section (and how to use format-specific tags)

   
   
   This section is more complex than the others. Examples of how the GIMP
   Plug-Ins work aren't of much use without some images to go with them.
   Unfortunately, not all output formats support images (remember: we're
   using SGML so we can create HTML, info, man pages, and whatever other
   formats are supported by the LinuxDoc package). We need to force this
   section to be processed differently depending on which formatter we're
   running the SGML source through. The way we do this is to use
   format-specific tags and the SGML equivalent of an escape sequence.
   You're already seen one of these in the section where we forced an
   HTML break tag. The generic format of this SGML tag is:

        <![%fmttag; [ <? ... > ]]>

   Where fmttag is one of
     * fmthtml
     * fmttxt
     * fmttex
     * fmtrtf
     * and so forth
       
   and the 3 dots are the format-specific text you want to be passed
   directly to the output file. If the sgml parser sees the fmttag tag
   and it matches the output format you've requested then the
   format-specific text is written to the output file. If it doesn't
   match the format requested, the text is ignored.
   
   Thats the technical explanation. Whats worse is it doesn't appear to
   work (or I'm doing it wrong - one of the two).
   
   Until I figure this problem out you have one of two choices:
     * Put in a URL pointing to examples on some other page
     * Use the Sparkle SGML source as an example.
       
   The former of these can be done with the following line:

        <htmlurl url="http://www.some.net/dir/file.html"
        name="&lt;http://http.some.net/dir/file.html&gt;">

   Just substitute the appropriate URL.
   
   The latter of the two options can be downloaded from
   http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel/gimp/gdp/plug-ins/sparkle.sgml. You may
   need to hold down the Shift key to force this file to be downloaded
   and not displayed.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
The Notes Section

   The Notes Section is the place to stuff everything that doesn't fit
   neatly into the other sections, such as known bugs, limitations, or
   future enhancements that are planned.
   
   Example:

        <sect>Notes
        <P>

   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
The Table of Contents

   This is a single line that goes immediately after the Title
   Information Section and immediately before the Introduction Section.
   It should look exactly like this:
   

        <toc>

   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Section Markers

   There are several layers of sections available, but we only require
   the top two:

        <sect>
        <sect1>

   The sect tag forces a new page in the output files. The sect1 just
   gets another type of formatting on that same page. You can add sect2
   and sect3 levels if you want, but I'm not sure what they do to the
   output.
   
   Note that you must put the following immediately after the section
   tags:

        <p>

   This tells the SGML parser to end the section header and begin the
   part of the document that belongs in that section.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Forcing new paragraphs

   This is simple, just add the following:

        <p>

   Note that its also possible to use blank lines to force new
   paragraphs, but whether the SGML parser uses the blank line as a
   paragraph or not depends on where its used. Its easier to just use the
   above tag to be sure.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Comments

   If you want to put comments in your SGML, you would do it like so:

        <-- This is an SGML Comment line -->

   Note that this is very similar to the HTML comment.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Lists

   To create a bulleted list, do the following:

        <itemize>
                <item>Item one
                <item>Item two
                <item>Item three
        </itemize>

   To create a numbered list, do the following:

        <enum>
                <item>Item one
                <item>Item two
                <item>Item three
        </enum>

   Pretty straight forward, really.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
How to test your SGML

   You can verify your SGML documentation will work with the various
   format converters by running it through each one. For example, to
   check if you can get the HTML output with an SGML file called
   plugin.sgml, try:

        sgml2html plugin

   To get text output, try:

        sgml2txt plugin

   To get man page output in groff format, try:

        sgml2txt -man plugin

   You should read the man pages for each of the sgml2<whatever> commands
   to learn the command line options. They are really pretty easy to use.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Updates I've made to the LinuxDoc package

   I've made two distinct changes to the LinuxDoc package. The first is
   to the linuxdoc.dtd file, found under the lib/dtd directory after you
   unpack LinuxDoc. The following was added right before the last line:

<!-- added fmt* which were somehow missing -->
<!-- default is ignore, override on commandline in sgml2* -->
<!entity % fmttex  "ignore">
<!entity % fmthtml "ignore">
<!entity % fmttxt  "ignore">
<!entity % fmtinfo "ignore">
<!entity % fmtrtf  "ignore">
<!entity % fmtlyx  "ignore">

   These allow for format-specific tags in the SGML source so you can,
   for example, add a graphic in your HTML output but just include the
   description of the image in your text output.
   
   The other change was to the html2html.l flex file under html-fix. The
   changes aren't complex, but theres a number of them to allow for
   command line options to set the background, text, and link colors. If
   you want this I can send it to you, but its not really necessary to
   test your SGML before submitting it to me.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Notes about creating documents in the various formats

   First of all, there are a set of scripts in LinuxDoc for creating
   documents in the various formats:
     * sgml2html
     * sgml2txt
     * sgml2info
     * sgml2rtf
     * sgml2lyx
     * sgml2latex
       
   Note: In order to do format specific tagging, you'll need to update
   your linuxdoc.dtd file. See the section on LinuxDoc Updates (found on
   the website listed in the introductory section of this article) for
   the details.
   
   The first of these, sgml2html, was used to create the new Sparkle
   documentation, as well as the HTML version of the SGML template. It
   works quite well using "free-formatted" input files. By free-formatted
   I mean that the actual text (not the formatting tags) can be one word
   per line or any number of words per line and the output will come out
   nicely formatted using as many words as will fit in your web browser.
   
   The text formatter, sgml2txt, also works quite well. The output has
   various formatting characters that work well with the "less" and,
   possibly, "more" pagers.
   
   The GNU Info formatter, sgml2info, is not happy with such free
   formatting of the text, however.
   
   I have not tried the other formatters yet. I don't know what RTF is
   and I've not used the Lyx or Latex tools so I'm not sure how to test
   the output from these formatters.

              SETTING UP DYNAMIC IP WEB SERVER VIA PPP CONNECTION
                                       
    By Henry H. Lu, honglu@rt66.com,
    http://www.tc.umn.edu/nlhome/m508/luxxx012/

      Published in Issue 10 of the Linux Gazette
      
   
   
   Have you been thinking of seting up a reachable web server at your
   home PC in addition to your permenent page at ISP? There are obvious
   reasons to do this: You can show off your home linux box to the world;
   you do not need to use other messy method (email) to know your current
   IP in order to login remotely; finally, it is fun!
   
   First, You need to have ppp connection and httpd working and a
   PERMANENT web page before trying the following dynamic IP solution.
   
  DESCRIPTION OF FILES:
  
   
   
   web_up: shell script I run to update webpage at permenet site with new
   IP whenever connection is up.
   
   web_down: shell script I run before shutting down the link, to inform
   others of the shutdown
   
   update_uppage: perl scripts to creat up.html page with updated IP
   address on the fly, called by web_up.
   
   up.html_source: fixed part of up.html
   
   down.html: web page used when link is down.
   
   /etc/add, /etc/last_add: files where I put IP address.
   
   ip-down, ip-up: files executed when ppp link is disconnected or
   connected. they are used to update the /etc/add files here.
   
  NOW LETS LOOK AT SCRIPTS WEB_UP:
------------------------------------------------------------------

    #!/bin/sh
    #check new IP
    new_ip()
    {
    if [ -f /etc/add ]; then
       if [ -f /etc/last_add ]; then
          if /usr/bin/diff /etc/add /etc/last_add >/dev/null ; then
              exit 1
          else
              return 0
          fi
       else
          return 0
       fi
    else
       exit 1
    fi
    }

    #check whether maroon is connected
    try_connect()
    {
    if ping -c4 -l3 128.101.118.21  2>&1 | grep "0 packets" > /dev/null
    then
       return 1
    else
       return 0
    fi
    }

    if try_connect
    then
         touch  /var/run/maroon_connected
    else
         rm -f /var/run/maroon_connected
    fi

    # ftp to update page
    if [ -f /var/run/maroon_connected ] && new_ip
    then
       # update_uppage is perl scripts, exit status is opposite of shell
       if ( ! /home/honglu/public_html/update_uppage )
       then
          cd /home/honglu/public_html
          if echo "put up.html /nlhome/m508/luxxx012/dynamic.html" \
              | /usr/bin/ftp maroon
          then
             rm -f /etc/last_add
             cp /etc/add  /etc/last_add
             exit 0
          else
             exit 1
          fi
       fi
    else
        exit 1
    fi

-----------------------------------------------------------------

   
   
   Now let's look at web_up in detail.
   
   Function new_ip() is used to check whether we have new IP and whether
   the new IP is different from the last one. /etc/ppp/ip-up and
   /etc/ppp/ip-down update IP adress in files /etc/add and /etc/last_add
   so that we can compare files "add" with "last_add" to tell whether we
   need to update page.
   
   Function try_connect() is used to test whether the perment web site is
   reachable.
   
   Next is fun part, I used automatic feature of ftp to update webpage.
   In order to make it work, you have to set file ~/.netrc correctly,
   type "man ftp" for more information.
   
   update_uppage is straitforward perl scripts to parse and creat up.html
   by using new IP from /etc/add file.
   
   Final part is to update /etc/add /etc/last_add to reflect correct
   status IP address.
   
   You can put "web_up" in your crontab entry ( or ip-up, or
   keapalive.sh) to let it execute automatically whenever your PC is
   connected.
   
  WEB_DOWN IS A SIMILAR PAGE, MAIN DIFFERENCE IS IN FTP PART:
-----------------------------------------------------
......
......
# ftp to send down.html page
if [ -f /var/run/maroon_connected ]
then
      cd /home/honglu/public_html
      if  echo "put down.html /nlhome/m508/luxxx012/dynamic.html" \
        | /usr/bin/ftp maroon
      then
          rm -f /etc/last_add
      else
          exit 1
      fi
else
      exit 1
fi

----------------------------------------------------

   
   
   Instead of ftp up.html as web_up did, web_down put down.html to
   permenent web site to inform the delink of page.
   
   web_down should be run before you shut down the machine. I created a
   scripts called "shut" to shutdown machine:
-----------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
if web_down
then
   shutdown -h now
else
   echo "can not web_down"
   exit 1
fi
-----------------------------------------

XaoS: A New Fractal Program for Linux

   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
    by Larry Ayers

      Published in Issue 10 of the Linux Gazette
      
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
   Transforming certain recursive complex-number formulae into images of
   unlimited depth and complexity was only made possible by the
   development of the modern computer. Benoit Mandelbrot, a Belgian
   researcher working for IBM, first discovered the Mandelbrot set in
   1981. By the mid-eighties personal computers had evolved to the point
   that anyone could experiment with various fractals, and programmers
   soon discovered that the 8-bit 256-color vga palette could be mapped
   to various parameters, which allowed the creation of stunning animated
   images.
   
   The most comprehensive and feature-filled of all fractal-generation
   programs is Fractint, a freeware program originally written for DOS.
   Fractint is maintained by a far-flung group of developers, rather like
   Linux. It was ported to unix by Ken Shirriff and a Linux version is
   commonly included in many Linux distributions. Not all features of the
   DOS version work in Linux, and if you just want to see what fractals
   are all about Fractint is probably overkill. It has such a multitude
   of options and features that it can be somewhat overwhelming to a new
   user.
   
   Recently Jan Hubicka (developer of the Koules X-window game) and
   Thomas Marsh have released a small fractal program for Linux called
   XaoS. This is an efficient program, with the option to compile both
   X-Windows and SVGA-console versions. XaoS can't render the dozens of
   fractal types which Fractint can, but it does the basic Mandelbrot and
   Julia sets quickly, with several keyboard options.
   
   It's developers refer to XaoS as "an interactive real-time fractal
   zoomer," and zooming in on an area of the Mandelbrot set is where XaoS
   excels. Pressing a mouse button anywhere in the image will begin a
   zoom with the location of the cursor as target. The "autopilot" mode
   is quite impressive; pressing "a" will start an automatic zoom which
   homes in on detailed areas. In the X-windows version the default
   window-size is 320x200; if you don't mind the cpu-usage a small XaoS
   window zooming away on the desktop can be pleasant to contemplate as
   you pause in your work. For those working in virtual consoles an
   SVGAlib version can be run in a variety of resolutions.
   
   Generating fractal images is inherently CPU-intensive. The faster your
   processor the better, especially when zooming in real time. XaoS does
   pretty well on my 80-mhz 486, but this may be near the lower limit.
   
   Here's a screenshot of XaoS:
   
   
   XaoS Window at 320x200
   
   XaoS only works on 8-bit displays at present, as is also true of
   Fractint. Images can be saved to GIF files by means of a keystroke.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  INSTALLATION
  
   
   
   Xaos uses a configure script for compilation, and it should compile
   easily on most systems. The executable is only about fifty kilobytes
   and is completely self-contained, i.e. no subsidiary files are
   required.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  AVAILABILITY
  
   
   
   The Xaos home-page is a good source for the latest version; the source
   has also been uploaded to Sunsite and its mirrors.

   Netscape binaries are more-or-less freely available for Linux, and the
   program works well, most of the time. As a Linux user I've become
   accustomed to a large potential for customization in software, right
   down to the source-code level. Netscape is available only as a large,
   opaque executable and the source is proprietary. I don't necessarily
   want a web-browser to fetch email and newspostings for me; I use other
   programs for those purposes but with Netscape those functions are
   unwanted baggage, loaded into memory every time the browser start up.
   
   The recent beta versions of Xmosaic (the latest is 2.7b5) have been
   quicker-loading alternatives. Background colors and images are
   supported, but it just isn't as quick to load images and pages as
   Netscape.
   
   Scott Powers, head of the Xmosaic development team at the University
   of Illinois, has for the past couple of months been leading a new
   Xmosaic project. The Xmosaic developers felt that the code upon which
   the version 2.7 and earlier browsers had been based needed a complete
   rewrite. Version 2.8 is now in public alpha testing. The project has
   been dubbed "Hyperion", as a sign that something totally new is in the
   works.
   
   A mailing list for Hyperion has arisen lately. Perusing the messages
   from the developers one can feel the excitement in the air. These
   people are really motivated, and working extremely long hours as well.
   Most days a "snapshot" of that day's code level is available from
   their ftp site.
   
   The first alpha releases were pretty rudimentary; there was no image
   support and many HTML files couldn't be loaded. I think that the
   source code was released at such an early level so that the developers
   could be sure that the core parsing routines, etc., could be
   successfully compiled on all targeted platforms. On September 10 the
   alpha version 2 was completed and released. Image support is now
   functional, though at this stage you must use specific versions of the
   JPEG and Xpm libraries. There's still a long way to go before Xmosaic
   2.8 is actually very usable, but that's what the alpha tester's
   reports are helping to expedite.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?
  
   
   
   Scott Powers and the rest of the Hyperion team have an impressive list
   of planned features. One of the most exciting is a modularization of
   the source code. This means that if you wanted a speedy, basic browser
   the compile-time option would be available to not include, say, Java
   and sound support. A user could conceivably compile several versions,
   each with different capabilities.
   
   Developers of web-browsers are faced with some difficult decisions.
   What standards to follow? How many of the "Netscape-isms" are now
   prevalent enough to be considered desirable? As an example, tables are
   now standard and to be expected in any new browser, as are forms.
   Frames are another matter; they are common on the web but many find
   them of limited value and they have yet to gain widespread acceptance.
   Xmosaic 2.8 will be HTML-3 compliant, and various sorts of multimedia
   support are being discussed. The alpha-testers have been making
   numerous suggestions, and their ideas are being taken seriously by the
   Xmosaic team.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  LOCATIONS AND SOURCES
  
   
   
   If you'd like to check in from time to time and see what progress has
   been made, Xmosaic 2.8 is the home-page. The current alpha (and before
   too long, beta) version source code can be downloaded from the page.
   The ftp site might be faster, but at this early stage the source code
   is only about three hundred kilobytes. Information concerning the
   mailing list is also on the home page.
   
   I encourage anyone who has a little time and the inclination to
   participate in the alpha testing. Every bug report contributes to a
   higher quality final release, and I'd hate to see Xmosaic 2.8 work
   really well only on Sparc or HPUX machines because not enough Linux
   users contributed reports!

   I must say that after 2 months of being the Editor of the Gazette, I
   am still having fun, and judging from the mail I think you guys, our
   readers, are too. John Fisk is right--the Gazette is a lot of work,
   and worth every bit of it.
   
   Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who
   wrote giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks
   also to our new mirror sites. I get more mail about mirrors than just
   about anything, except maybe readers wanting the Gazette to be
   available as one big file. We are providing that this month along with
   the separate page format. (See The Whole Damn Thing in the Table of
   Contents.) Doing the Gazette in multi-file format is just the easiest
   way for me to build the magazine. I've tried to be responsive to all
   mail and reasonable requests. If I missed you, send your mail again,
   and I'll get back to you.
   
   The most important thing I'm working on outside of work these days is
   definitely "not Linux". I'm making a baby quilt for a friend of mine
   in Houston. The baby is 2 months old now, and if I don't get it
   finished soon, it will be too small for her to use. The geometry, as
   well the art, of quilting has always fascinated me--must have to do
   with being a math person.
   
   If you would like some personal information about me, clicking on my
   name below will take you to my home page. It's not very jazzy at the
   moment, but I'm looking for the time to fix it up.
