Proposed /opt addition to the FSSTND.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

/etc/opt -- Machine-specific configuration files for /opt

Machine-specific configuration files for add-on application software
packages shall be installed within the directory /etc/opt/<package>,
where <package> is the name of the subtree in /opt where the static
data from that package is stored.  No structure is imposed on the
internal arrangement of /etc/opt/<package>.

If a configuration file must reside in a different location in order
for the package or system to function properly, it may be placed in a
location other than /etc/opt/<package>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

/opt -- Add-on application software packages
|
+-bin       Executable files invoked directly by users
+-man       Package manual pages
+-<package> Static package objects

/opt is reserved for the installation of add-on application software
packages.

A package to be installed in /opt shall install its static files in a
separate /opt/<package> directory tree, where <package> is the name of
the software package.  The possible exceptions are user-executable
files and user-readable manual pages (accessed via `man'), which may
optionally be installed in /opt/bin and /opt/man, respectively.

User-executable files that are not installed in the /opt/bin directory
shall be installed in the directory /opt/<package>/bin.

User-readable manual pages that are not installed in the /opt/man
directory tree shall be installed in /opt/<package>/man.  /opt/man
shall have the same substructure as /usr/man.  If /opt/<package>/man
is present, the same substructure as /usr/man shall be used.

Package files that are variable (change in normal operation) should be
installed in /var/opt.  See the section on /var/opt for more
information.

Machine-specific configuration files should be installed in /etc/opt.
See the section on /etc for more information.

No other package files should exist outside the /opt, /var/opt, and
/etc/opt hierarchies except for those package files that must reside
in specific locations within the filesystem tree in order to function
properly.  For example, device lock files must be placed in /var/lock
and devices must be located in /dev.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

/var/opt -- Variable data for /opt

Variable data should be installed in /var/opt/<package>, where
<package> is the name of the subtree in /opt where the static data
from an add-on software package is stored, except where superseded by
another file in /etc.  No structure is imposed on the internal
arrangement of /var/opt/<package>.

Page 2-16 "File tree for add-on software"

/opt, /var/opt and /etc/opt are reserved in the file tree for the installation
of application software packages.  Each add-on software package should adhere
to the following rules:

 o Static package objects should be installed in /opt/pkg, where pkg is the
   package abberviation or instance.

 o Package objects that change in normal operations (for example, log and
   spool files) should be installed in /var/opt/pkg.

 o machine-specific configuration files should be installed in /etc/opt/pkg

 o Executables that are directly invoked by users should be installed in
   /opt/pkg/bin

 o Only package objects that must reside in specific locations within the
   system file tree in order to function properly (for example, special
   files in /dev) should be installed in those locations.

The /opt subtree

The directoy /opt of the / file system is the point of access to the /opt
subtree.  This directory subtree contains files installed by add-on
packages.

The following describes the structure of the /opt subtree:

/opt          The top directory of the /opt subtree

/opt/bin      Executable files provided by application packages and
              invoked directly by users

/opt/pkg       Where pkg is the abbreviated name of an add-on software
               package, contains all the static files installed on the
               system as part of that package
