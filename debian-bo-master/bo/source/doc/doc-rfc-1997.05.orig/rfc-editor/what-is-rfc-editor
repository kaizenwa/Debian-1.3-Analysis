The Request for Comment Editor (RFC-Editor)
-------------------------------------------


The Requests for Comments (RFCs) are a series of notes, started in
1969, about the Internet (originally the ARPANET). The notes discuss
many aspects of computing and computer communication focusing in
networking protocols, procedures, programs, and concepts, but also
including meeting notes, opinion, and sometimes humor.

The specification documents of the Internet protocol suite, as defined
by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its steering group
(the IESG), are published as RFCs.

The RFC Editor is the publisher of the RFCs and is responsible for the
final editorial review of the documents.  The RFC Editor is chartered
by the Internet Society (ISOC) and the Federal Network Council (FNC).

Suggestions about RFC publication, or submission of material to be
considered for publication as an RFC should be sent via EMail to
<rfc-editor@isi.edu>.

The RFC Editor is located at and operated by the Information Sciences
Institute (ISI) of the University of Southern California (USC).
