Hi.

The Request For Comments (RFC) documents are intended to have wide
distribution.

1.  Copying and distributing the whole RFC without any changes:

1a.  The copying and free redistribution are generally encouraged.

1b.  The inclusion of RFCs in other documents and collections that are
distributed for a fee is also encouraged, though in this case it is a
courtesy (i) to ask the RFC author and (ii) provide the RFC author
with a copy of the final document or collection.  Anyone can takes
some RFCs, put them in a book, copyright the book, and sell it.  This
in no way inhibits anyone else from doing the same thing, or inhibits
any other distribution of the RFCs.

2.  Copying and distributing the whole RFC with changes in format,
font, etcetera:

2a.  The same as case 1 with the addition that a note should be made
of the reformatting.

3.  Copying and distributing portions of an RFC:

3a.  As with any material excerpted from another source, proper credit
and citations must be provided.

4.  Translating RFCs into other languages:

4a.  Since wide distribution of RFCs is very desirable, translation
into other languages is also desirable.  The same requirements and
courtesies should be followed in distributing RFCs in translation as
would be followed when distributing RFCs in the original language.
