<center><h1>Slang Applications for Linux</h1></center>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>John E. Davis of the Center for Space Research at MIT has written an
interpreted programming language called Slang, which has a C-like syntax. He
has written several programs using this language, including the slrn
newsreader and the emacs-like Jed editor.  Lately a few other programmers have
begun to make use of Slang; one reason for this is that Slang allows the use
of color in a text-mode program which will display equally well in an rxvt
window under X.

<p>Applications which are linked with the Slang library always seem to be
text-mode programs.  Typically Linux text-mode applications use the ncurses
library to handle screen display.  Ncurses enables the use of menus, a certain
amount of color, and a more complex screen layout.  These traits don't always
translate well into an X-Windows environment; i.e. running in an xterm or rxvt
window. If an application is linked with the Slang library instead its
behavior is more consistent between the console and X sessions, especially
when started from an rxvt window.

<hr>

<center><h3>An Aside Concerning Rxvt and Xterm</h3></center>

<p>I get the impression that the xterm terminal emulator is used more commonly
than rxvt, though this may be due more to tradition than innate
superiority. Rxvt has been revised several times recently and in its current
form (version 2.19) has much to recommend it. One feature which I appreciate
is that it's memory usage is much lower than that of xterm.  Rxvt handles
color requests well, both background/foreground specifications and
extension-specific colorization such as "color-ls".  The most recent version
even allows the use of Xpm images as background, similar to a web-page, though
as with a web-page a background image would have to be carefully chosen so as
not to obscure the text.

<p>Some xterm variants make use of color, but some don't.  I find the
plenitude of xterms and color-xterms rather confusing; it's hard to tell just
which ones you have, and they vary from distribution to distribution.  Then
there is xterm's Tektronix compatibility, which I've never seen a use for.
Reading the xterm man page I get the impression that xterm was developed for
older mainframe-and-terminal systems.

<center><h3>Applications Which Use Slang</h3></center>

<ol>
  <li><b>Slrn</b> is a fast, high quality news-reader which supports threading of
      messages, decoding of MIME attachments, and has the ability to tell a
      web-browser to load a URL contained within a message.  It has many
      other features and options; it is one of John Davis's programs and he
      actively supports it in the newsgroup <i>news.software.readers</i>.
  <li><b>Lynx</b>, the text-mode web-browser, looks less archaic when compiled with
      Slang support. If you can't see the images on a page, at least the text
      elements and background can be nicely colored!
  <li><b>Jed</b>, John Davis's emacs-like editor, is surprisingly capable considering
      it is a fraction of the size of any real emacs. If you've ever hesitated
      to start up Gnu Emacs or Xemacs just to read an info page, try Jed; it
      reads them just as well and is quicker to invoke. Jed has
      syntax-highlighting for a variety of file types.
  <li><b>The Midnight Commander</b>, the exemplary text-mode file-manager, now
      includes enough of the Slang files in its source distribution to compile
      with Slang screen management without Slang libraries on your
      system. Slang is the default in recent versions of MC and the two are
      well-matched.
  <li><b>Minicom</b> is available in a binary, Slang-enabled version at
      ftp://sunsite.unc.edu.  Color really makes this classic comm program
      more usable, especially in an rxvt window. 
  <li>The <b>Mutt</b> mail program is an interesting offshoot of Elm development
      which is well on its way toward becoming an alternative to Pine and Elm.
      Slang is listed as an alternative to ncurses in the pre-compilation
      configure script options, but I can't say how well it works as it will
      only successfully compile with ncurses on my system.
  <li><b>Dosemu</b>, though still dubbed an alpha version by the development
      team, is remarkably stable and useful.  Recently I compiled the latest
      version (I had been using an old RPM version) and was surprised to see
      that the configure script looks for the Slang library.  After the
      compilation I ran <i>ldd</i> against the <i>dos</i> binary and found
      that it is dynamically linked with the Slang library.  Interesting!  I
      looked through the source code and docs to see if there was any
      information on Dosemu's use of Slang, but finally gave up.  You could
      spend days wandering around the Byzantine directory hierarchy of Dosemu!
      
</ol>

<hr>

<p>I'm sure as the benefits of Slang become more widely known we shall see
more text-mode applications with Slang support included.  There very well be
others than the above-listed out there; these are just the ones I've run
across.

<hr>

<center><h3>Availability</h3></center>

<p>Precompiled binaries for slrn, lynx, and the Jed editor (with Slang
statically linked, I assume) are available at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu and its
mirrors .  I used these for some time, but recently I obtained the source for
Slang and compiled a shared library.  The advantage of this approach is that
you can compile binaries which dynamically link the Slang library at runtime.
Your executables will be smaller, and one shared library can service any
number of Slang-using applications. Another advantage to obtaining the source
distributions is that you'll end up with more documentation. 

<p>John E. Davis's creations (slrn, Jed, and the Slang sources) are available
at <a href="ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/">their MIT home site</a>. The most
recent versions, as well as beta versions, can be found there.

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local/">This Mexican site</a> is
the source for the most recent versions of the Midnight Commander, as well as
rxvt.

<p>Beta versions (which seem stable to me) of Michael Elkins' Mutt mail
program are available from <a href="ftp://cs.hnc.edu/pub/me">this FTP
site.</a> Maybe <i>you</i> can get it to compile with Slang!

<p>Lynx binaries with Slang support can be found at sunsite and its mirrors.

<p>The source for the latest and greatest of the Dosemu releases can be found
at the <a href="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu">tsx-11</a> FTP
site. (Version 0.64.1 was released in November).

<hr>

<p>If you're like me and work at the console often, you'll find it's nice to
have applications available which work well (and look good!) in an X session
too. I think you will be pleased with the high quality and low memory
usage of the above-listed apps.

<center><h1>Updates to My Past Reviews</h1></center>

<center><h4><a href="mailto: layers@vax2.rainis.net">by Larry
Ayers</a></h4></center>

<center>Copyright (c) 1996</center><BR>

<center><H5>Published in Issue 12 of the Linux Gazette</H5></center>

<p>I've been writing these short reviews and other articles for the Gazette
since issue number seven. Even with the short lead time inherent in a
WWW-based publication it seems like new releases and URL changes often happen
right after I submit an article. The status of several of the programs has
changed since I wrote of them, so I thought I'd take this opportunity to list
some of these changes.

<p>By the way, I appreciate all of the email I've received in response to my
articles; feel free to write if you have any comments or criticism.

<ul>

  <li><b>Moxfm</b> hasn't been updated since version 1.00 was released
      several months ago, but it's working well in the current version.  I've
      included it here because I've received several e-mail messages stating
      that the URL in the article wasn't working.  The current URL of the
      Moxfm home page is
      <a href="http://sugra.desy.de/user/mai/moxfm">http://sugra.desy.de/user/mai/moxfm</a>. 
      The source and binaries are in uuencoded form; just let them display on
      the screen of a web-browser, save them to a file, then run "uudecode
      filename.uue". 

  <li><b>TkDesk</b> has been through several versions since I wrote of it;
      the current one is 1.0b3, released on Sept.25, 1996.  There are many
      new features; one which I use often is a file pop-up menu-item which
      hands the file over to a running Xemacs on another desktop.  There is a
      similar capability involving HTML files and Netscape (or another
      browser).  Check out the
      <a href="http://sun1.rrzn-user.uni-hannover.de/~zzhibol/tkdesk">TkDesk
      web-page</a> for the latest news. 

  <li><b>FileRunner</b> has been developing rapidly in the past few months. 
      It's current version is 2.1.1, and many refinements have been made. 
      It's FTP capabilities have been greatly improved; FTP downloads can now
      run as a background process, and directories can be displayed
      date-ordered.  Remote FTP directories can be saved as bookmarks
      (accessible from a menu).  Many configuration options have been added
      as well.  The built-in shell windows which follow you from directory to
      directory are very handy.  They allow you to see the output of
      non-interactive commands (such as compilation) and can be dismissed
      when not needed.  There is a
      <a href="http://www.cd.chalmers.se/~hch/filerunner.html">FileRunner
      web-page</a> from which the source can be obtained, as well as from
      <a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/xutils/managers/">the Sunsite
      archive.</a>. 

  <li><b>Elvis</b> has finally made it to a major release; version 2.00 was
      announced recently. It's available from its
      <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/elvis/">official site</a>. Elvis is
      remarkable for the small size of the compiled binary, considering how
      powerful an editor it is.  Elvis's ability to display HTML in a readable
      form meshes well with the HTML format of the extensive help files.

  <li><b>Vile</b> has a new official maintainer; Paul Fox has handed over the
      reins to another of the primary Vile developers, Thomas Dickey.  Version
      6.2 was released recently.  For some reason Vile doesn't seem to be as
      popular as Vim and Elvis (judging by news-group postings).  I urge
      anyone who favors vi-style editors to give it a try; it really grows on
      you. Vile's new official release site is
      <a href="ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/vile/">ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/vile</a> 

  <li><b>XaoS</b> in its current release (1.2) has a new feature which increases
      its usability for those running X with more than 256 colors: it'll run!
      Previous releases only worked on 8-bit displays.

  <li><b>Yodl</b> version 1.08 has been released; it's mainly a
      "small-bug-fix" release, i.e. if a previous version does what you want,
      you probably don't need it.  It's at sunsite.

  <li><b>Procmeter</b> has been updated to version 2.2; changes include a
      choice of solid or bar-type graphing, and refinement of network packet
      transfer display.

  <li><b>Xmosaic</b> development has slowed since my review.  The
      powers-that-be at the University of Illinois have decided that Xmosaic
      will be the second, rather than the first, GTK (Graphics ToolKit)
      client to be developed.The GTK is a programming toolkit which will take
      the place of Motif in Xmosaic.  Scott Powers, Xmosaic's project leader,
      stated in a message to the mailing list that development will resume in
      a couple of months.  The up side to this news is that the GTK is the
      "hard part", so that once work resumes on Xmosaic development progress
      should be rapid.  </ul>

<center><h1>The YARD Rescue Disk Package</h1></center>

<center><h4><a href="mailto: layers@vax2.rainis.net">by Larry
Ayers</a></h4></center>

<center>Copyright (c) 1996</center><BR>

<center><H5>Published in Issue 12 of the Linux Gazette</H5></center>

<hr>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>It is a common practice to use the rescue/boot disks supplied with a Linux
distribution if filesystem problems occur and you need to boot from a floppy.
Typically these disks consist of a bootable compressed kernel on disk 1, with
the second disk containing basic maintenance tools such as fsck.

<p>On the few occasions I've had to boot from such disks the transition from
my familiar Linux environment to the bare-essentials, limited boot-disk system
(constrained by the size of a floppy disk) has been disconcerting, to say the
least.  Typically if an editor is available it's a small one with which I've
never worked, and many of the tools I'm used to having around aren't there.

<p>Recently <a href="mailto: fawcett@nynexst.com">Tom Fawcett</a> has been
refining a suite of customizable Perl scripts which make the creation of
boot-disks from scratch easier.  YARD (for Yet Another Rescue Disk) makes use
of (and requires) the optional Linux kernel compressed ramdisk option, which
allows you to load a compressed disk image into memory at boot-up.  Paul
Gortmaker has written a lucid explanation of the new ramdisk options in the
file "ramdisk.txt", which is in the Documentation subdirectory of recent
kernel source releases.

<center><h3>Installation and Usage</h3></center>

<p>The Yard distribution contains two files which need to be edited as a first
step. <i>Config.pl</i> is a Perl script which sets such preferences as the
type of floppy you're using and whether you are making a single boot-disk or a
double.  The <i>Bootdisk_Contents</i> file contains a list of all of the files
and utilities you would like on your disk(s).  This file needs to be edited
heavily, as it includes much more than will fit on even two disks.  Anything
you like can be included in this file.

<p>The next step is to run the Perl script <i>make_root_fs</i>.  This script
gathers up all of the files you've specified (as well as all libraries upon
which they depend) and constructs a root filesystem upon whichever device was
specified in the <i>Config.pl</i> script.  A ramdisk works well.  The new
filesystem is then compressed with gzip into a single file in your /tmp
directory.  Once this process is complete yet another Perl script,
<i>check_root_fs</i> is run, which makes sure that all needed
libraries,etc. are present.

<p>After all of this preparation you're ready to actually write the rescue
disks; here's where you find out if you've attempted to cram too much into
them. The <i>write_rescue_disk</i> script first copies your compressed kernel
(vmlinuz) onto the disk (the first disk if it's a two-disk set) and then
copies the compressed filesystem image you've constructed onto whatever is
left.  It took me several tries to pare down what I wanted Initially on the
disks to what would actually fit.  The virtue of the Yard system is that all
you need to do to try again is re-edit the <i>Bootdisk_Contents</i> file and
re-make the filesystem. Yard also writes log-files which can be helpful in
diagnosing problems.
 
<p>Modular kernels are great, but if you boot a kernel image and a capability
you need is a demand-loaded module you're out of luck.  Yard sidesteps this
potential problem by including your modules directory in the compressed
filesystem, as well as making sure that the kernel-daemon /sbin/kerneld is
started at boot-up.

<p>The result of this process is a customized miniature Linux system. It's a
nice feeling to know that if your filesystem is in shambles due to a power
outage or a beta program run amuck that you at least have familiar tools
available.

<p>Once you've managed to edit a set of Yard configuration files which will
successfully write working rescue disks, consider saving copies of these files
in case the disks become corrupted.  I just replaced the supplied files with
my edited copies, then tarred and gzipped the Yard distribution and saved it
to floppy.

<center><h3>Caveats</h3></center>

<p>Yard gives you the option of using or not using Lilo to boot your disks. I
first tried Yard with Lilo, as Lilo has always worked well for me.  It
wouldn't work with my Yard disks, so I disabled that option.  I'm using an old
version of Lilo, left over from my original Slackware 3.00 Linux installation,
which may explain this failure.  Yard works fine without it.  Lilo might be
necessary if you need to include parameters in order to boot your system, such
as those required for some SCSI hard disks.

<center><h3>Availability</h3></center>

<p>Yard is available from <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~fawcett/">the Yard
home-page</a>, as well as from the sunsite archive and its mirrors.  It's well
worth trying if you want the ultimate in control over just what is included on
your rescue disks.
