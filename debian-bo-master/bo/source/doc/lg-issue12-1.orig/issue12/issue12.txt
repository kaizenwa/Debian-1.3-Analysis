Linux Gazette... making Linux just a little more fun!

Welcome to Linux Gazette! (tm)

   
   
   Linux Gazette, a member of the Linux Documentation Project, is an
   on-line WWW publication that is dedicated to two simple ideas:
     * Making Linux just a little more fun
     * Sharing ideas and discoveries
       
   
   
   The basic idea behind these two concepts is that Linux is one cool OS,
   whose price for admission is a willingness to read, learn, tinker
   (aka, hack!), and then share your experiences. The Gazette is a
   compilation of basic tips, tricks, suggestions, ideas and short
   articles about Linux designed to make using Linux fun and easy. LG
   began as a personal project of John M. Fisk, and grew to include
   contributions freely provided by a growing number of authors. Linux
   Journal is now publishing the Gazette using material contributed by
   outside authors (note to potential authors). Without these authors
   there would not be a Gazette, and I thank them all. Drop a note to the
   author of anything that you find helpful or instructive--the author's
   e-mail address is included for this very purpose.
   
   Linux Gazette is a non-commercial publication and will remain that
   way. A tar, gzip file containing all issues of Linux Gazette and one
   containing the current issue can be found at ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg/
   
   
   Thanks to Matt Welsh, coordinator of the Linux Documentation Project,
   for graciously bringing the Linux Gazette under the auspices of the
   LDP. The material included in these documents is covered by a
   designedly liberal copyright: as long as you are using the material
   for non-commercial purposes, you may do with them as you please. For

   A new table of contents will appear with each issue that will allow
   you to easily find articles of interest. A search engine is also
   provided to allow you to search all issues for items relating to a
   particular subject.
   
   Have fun!

   Subject: Comments on Issue #11 
   From: "R. Frank Louden" flouden@fairfield.home.sweet.net
   
   
   I am always glad to see another issue of LG. Thank you for taking the
   time to compose it. One comment I'd like to make is the most recent
   issue (#11) is difficult for me to read on the spiral binding
   background. For me, the text lies over close enough to the left edge
   of the page, and it is almost hidden in some parts of the page.
   
   I may be one of a dying breed but I choose to use Mosaic and wish
   others would consider that MS and Netscape do NOT adhere to the HTML
   specs and are fragmenting the standards. I note that NCSA is working
   on a new version that will provide support that is not currently found
   in the version I use. I am at this moment using an unsupported version
   2.7b5 (it's kinda buggy) but when it works it allows me to see the
   background you have used.
   
   While whirly-gigs and gewgaws are nice, some of us are still not able
   to upgrade hardware at the whim of the industry and need to have some
   consideration from those who sponsor WWW HTML documents. I have
   accessed pages that are completely illegible (with my old Mosaic) and
   others (with a more up-to-date browser) that take prohibitively long
   times to download. There IS something to be said for standards.
   
   Thanks again for the Gazette! It is great!!!
   
     (There may be more than one problem here. First off, if you are
     using a mirror site, the problem is my fault. Somehow, when
     building the tar file for the mirror sites, a gif that was integral
     to the notebook motif -- it moved the print away from the spiral --
     was left out. I am in the process of notifying the mirror site
     where the missing file can be downloaded.
     
     The notebook spiral was put in using "tables" which is an HTML
     standard. Here at SSC we too believe in following HTML standards.
     In fact the program that we use to push things to the web checks
     that the HTML conforms.
     
     I have worried that by adding more graphics we might be causing
     problems with download times. However, we also would like to keep
     LG looking good, so thought we'd add away and see what kind of
     comments we get. So far it's tied. One who likes the spiral and
     yours against. BTW, if you are accessing LG through a mirror site,
     try the main site and see if it does better for you
     (http://www.ssc.com/lg).
     
     Glad you like LG, I certainly have fun putting it together.

   Hello, this is Dennis from Greece.
   
   Well this time I managed to download the whole thing so now I have a
   full mirror. The only problem is that I didn't get (or I don't have)
   the searchbtn.gif and the htsearch.cgi that are used for the search
   engine.
   
   Did I make something wrong or should I have something I don't?
   
   Thank you in advance.
   Dennis
   
     (No, you did nothing wrong. I was so excited to have the search
     engine, I forgot that the mirrors wouldn't have the proper data
     bases. Since these data bases are very big and are for all of the
     SSC site, we have changed the links for the data base so that it
     always refers back to the SSC site rather than a relative address
     pointing to the mirror site. The updated front page file is in the
     update tar file along with the missing files. Let me know if it
     works for you. --Editor)

   It's the first time I hear about Linux Gazette, I'd want to have all

   the horrible message "Login Error". What could I do?

     (Not sure why you are having a problem. I can tell that others are
     able to download from that address without problem. Are you using
     your browser to point to that address or logging on with anonymous
     ftp?
     
     I would suggest using a ftp mirror site that is closer to you.
     Unfortunately, Linux Gazette does not have a mirror site in South
     America at this time. There is one in Mexico which is somewhat
     closer to you than Seattle.
     
     At any rate if you go to the Mirror Site page
     (http://www.ssc.com/lg/mirrors.html) in Linux Gazette, and use the
     links there to go to one of the ftp sites (ours or one of the
     mirrors), you shouldn't be asked for a login. (I never have been
     and that's why I am a little confused by the message you are
     getting.) Let me know if you continue to have problems, and thanks

   Hello Jimmy!
   
   Thanks so much for taking the time to write! I appreciate it. I
   honestly can't take the credit for this -- the kind folks at SSC (and
   the Linux Journal) offered to take over the management of the LG when
   its administrative upkeep just got to be too much. Marjorie Richardson
   is its capable new Editor.
   
   I've taken the liberty of cc'ing a copy of this to her -- definitely
   deserves a pat on the back.
   
   Thanks again and Best Wishes,

   and ask those that you give links for to provide links to you. This

     have a link for on the LG front page. I have added a link to SSC's

  A 2 CENT CONSOLE TRICK

   From: Igor Markov imarkov@math.ucla.edu
   Organization: UCLA, Department of Mathematics
   
   
   Hi,
   
   Here's my 2c console trick:
   I put the following line into my ~/.xsession file:

nxterm -ls -geometry 80x5+45+705 -rv -sb -name "System mesages" -fn 5x7
       -T "System messages" -e tail -f /var/log/messages &

   and this one into my .fvwm:

Style "System messages" NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip

   When I login, I have a small 5-line (but scrollable) window near the
   left bottom corner (you may need to change numbers in -geometry) where
   system messages appear in tiny font as soon as they are produced. This
   lets me see when my dial-up script succeeds, when someone logs into my
   computer via TCP/IP, when some system error happen etc.
   
   The .fvwm setup strips the title bar and does other useful things, but
   is not necessary.
   
   Caveat: if you leave this window for long time, a cron job which trims
   /var/log/messages will change the inode # for the file and tail -f is
   bound to freeze. In 99% this cron job wakes up 2-3am, so tail freeze
   may freeze only overnight. Login/logout and everything will be OK. Any
   other ideas?
   
   Igor

    Date: Sat, 2 Nov 1996 10:57:30 -0500 (EST)
   From: Preston Brown pbrown@econ.yale.edu
   
   
   Regarding the recent message about not being able to get IP
   masquerading working with 2.0.xx kernels:
   
   First, I *believe* that IP forwarding may have to be enabled for
   firewall support, but I can't say for sure. Suffice to say that I have
   forwarding, firewalling, and masquerading all compiled into my kernel.
   I have a PPP link set up to the outside world, and my local ethernet
   subnet (192.168.2.x) is masquerades so it can talk to the outside
   world as well.
   
   ipfwadm is used to set up the information (I call it from
   /etc/rc.d/rc.local at boot time):

# ip forwarding policies
ipfwadm -F -p deny                      ; default policy is to deny
                                        ; forwarding to  all hosts.
ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.2.0/24       ; add an entry for masquerading of
                                        ; my local subnet
modprobe ip_masq_ftp                    ; load ftp support module

   a 'ipfwadm -F -l' (i.e. list all forwarding policies) yields:

IP firewall forward rules, default policy: deny
type  prot source               destination          ports
acc/m all  192.168.2.0/24       anywhere             n/a

   Indicating that all is fine. Your local subnet now should be set up to
   talk to the outside world just fine.

  HOW TO TRUNCATE /VAR/ADM/MESSAGES
  
   
   
    Date: Fri, 1 Nov 1996 09:58:52 -0800 (PST)
   From: Alex alex@gor.eur.compaq.com
   Organization: Rijnhaave Neterken / Compaq
   
   
   In answer to the question:
   
     What is the proper way to close and reopen a new /var/adm/messages
     file from a running system?
     
   Step one: rename the file. Syslog will still be writing in it after
   renaming so you don't lose messages. Step two: create a new one. After
   re-initializing syslogd it will be used. Step three: Make syslog use
   the new file. Do not restart it, just re-initialize.
    1. mv /var/adm/messages /var/adm/messages.prev
    2. touch /var/adm/messages
    3. kill -1 pid-of-syslogd
       
   
   
   This should work on a decent Unix(like) system, and I know Linux is
   one of them.

  HTML, USE OF BODY ATTRIBUTES 
  
   
   
   Date: Thu, 14 Nov 1996 12:55:15 -0500
   From: "Michael O'Keefe", michael.okeefe@lmc.ericsson.se
   Organization: Ericsson Research Canada
   
   
   G'day,
   
   If you are going to use any of the attributes to the tag, then you
   should supply all of the attributes, even if you supply just the
   default values.
   
   The default tag for Netscape, Mosaic and MSIE is
   
   If you wish to slip the BACKGROUND attribute in there, by all means
   continue to do so, but for completeness (and good HTML designing) you
   should supply the other attributes as well.
   
   The reason? You don't know what colors the user has set, and whether
   just setting a BACKGROUND image, or just a few of the colors will
   render the page viewable or not. By supplying all of the values, even
   at their defaults, you ensure that everything contrasts accordingly

  "LOWERIT" SHELL SCRIPT
  
   
   
    Date: Fri, 1 Nov 1996 09:58:52 -0800 (PST)
   From: Phil Hughes, fyl@ssc.com
   
   
   Here is a handy-dandy little shell script. It takes all the plain
   files (not directories) in the current directory and changes their
   names to lower case. Very handy when you unzip a bunch of MS-DOS
   files. If a name change would result in overwriting an existing file
   the script asks you before doing the overwrite.

--------------------------- cut here -----------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
# lowerit
# convert all file names in the current directory to lower case
# only operates on plain files--does not change the name of directories
# will ask for verification before overwriting an existing file
for x in `ls`
  do
  if [ ! -f $x ]; then
    continue
    fi
  lc=`echo $x  | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`
  if [ $lc != $x ]; then
    mv -i $x $lc
  fi
  done

  REMOVING USERS 
  
   
   
   Date: 11 Nov 1996 18:54:02 GMT
   From: Geoff Short, grs100@york.ac.uk
   
   
   To remove users do the following:
   
   Simple setups:
     * Delete password entry for user from /etc/passwd
     * Remove user's files using rm -r /home/user
     * Reboot (if any processes still running)
       
   More complex setups:

  ROOT AND PASSWORDS
  
   
   
    Date: Fri, 1 Nov 1996 09:58:52 -0800 (PST)
   From: Steve Mann smann@ultrix.ramapo.edu
   Subject: Re: Root and passwords
   
   If you have forgotten your root password:
    1. Use a boot disk.
    2. Login as root.
    3. Mount the partition with your Linux.
    4. Edit the second field, which is the encrypted password, of
       /etc/passwd to show nothing. It would look something like this:

root::0:0:root,,,:/:/bin/zsh
   instead of something like this:

wimpy:GoqTFXl3f:0:0:Steve:/root:/bin/zsh

   You should then be able to login as root with no password at all.
   
   Steve

  TALK DAEMON AND DYNAMIC ADDRESSES 
  
   
   
   Date: 11 Nov 1996 16:33:02 GMT
   From: Adam Jenkins, ajenkins@kalgoorlie.cs.umass.edu 
   Organization: CMPSCI Department, UMass Amherst
   
   
   Having problems sending a talk request to an IP-address other than
   your own?
   
   The solution is to reset your host name to your new dynamic address.
   You need to figure out what dynamic address you've been assigned. Then
   you can use the "host" command to find the symbolic name for it, and
   then use the "hostname" command to reset your machine's hostname. Like
   this:
   
   host 128.119.220.0a
   
   Prints out a name. Use it in:
   
   hostname name.domain.edu
   
   That's it. You need to be root to run the "hostname" command with an
   argument. If you're using pppd to get your connection, you can put all
   of this into your /etc/ppp/ip-up script -- read the pppd man page for
   more info -- so that it will get done automatically when you log in.
   
   The reason you need to do this is because when talk sends a talk
   request, it also sends along what it thinks is the return address so
   that the remote talk can respond. So if your local machine has a fake
   address, the remote talk will get that as the return address and
   you'll never see the response.
   
   I also saw a patched version of talk on sunsite somewhere, where he
   made some hack to talk to get it to find your real address. But I like
   the "hostname" solution better because I've found at least one other
   program with the same problem, and the "hostname" solution fixes it
   too.

  TAR TRICKS
  
   
   
    Date: Tue, 12 Nov 1996 15:01:58 +0000
   From: Dominic Binks dominic.binks@aethos.co.uk
   Organization: AEthos Communication Systems Ltd.
   
   
   A couple of things that interested me about the article on tar. I'm
   sure that the idea is to introduce pipes, and some of the lesser known
   unix utilities (tr, cut), but

        tar -tfvz file.tar.gz | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f8 | less

   can be written more concisely

        tar tfz file.tar.gz | less

   Also you can use wild cards so

        tar tfz file.tar.gz *README*

   will list all readmes in the file.
   
   Finally two last pieces of useful Unix magic.

        tar cfv - dir

   will tar the directory dir and send the output to standard output. One
   piece of magic liked by Unix gurus is

        tar cfv - dir | (cd dir2; tar xf -)

   which copies one directory hierarchy to another location.
   
   Another piece of tar that might be really useful is that taring up a
   dos file system and moving it somewhere else will preserve
   *everything*. This means you can move your main DOS partition around,
   something that is very difficult to do with DOS.
   
   One final tip for all UNIX newbies: you got a file which unix will not
   allow you to delete.

        rm -- 'file'

   will get rid of it. In general -- terminates argument processing so
   that everything following is passed directly to the executable.
   
   Have fun

  CEASE FIRE!
  
   
   
   Date: Wed 13 Nov 1996
   
   Bill Machrone, vice president of technology for Ziff-Davis Publishing
   Co, recently wrote in an article about Linux that Netscape 3.0 and
   Java were not yet available for Linux. He was wrong. Such things
   happen. Big deal. Even magazines of the highest quality sometimes
   print things that are wrong. You tell them about it, and they print a
   correction in the next issue. That's the way professionals handle
   things.
   
   That's not what some Linux people did, however. Instead, they flamed
   him, in private and in public. That's stupid. They urged others to
   also send flames to Machrone, which is worse.
   
   Things wouldn't be so bad, but now we have the Internet. The Internet
   allows just a few idiots completely ruin the reputation of Linux.
   
   Please, if you want to advocate Linux, be civil.

  LINUX IN THE NEWS
  
   
   
   For the latest article about Linux by Bill Machrone, see the November
   11 issue of PC Week, "Up Periscope". This is a good article in which
   he requests feedback from Linux users.
   
   "The Linux Software Map" Unix Review, January, 1997, discusses the
   need for Linux documentation and the Linux Software Map (LSM).
   
   From Martin Michlmayr of Linux International we learn:
   According to a survey among a partial readership of iX, a German
   magazine devoted to Unix and networking, Linux is used at work by 45%
   of the readers. Solaris 1 and 2 taken together come second with 36%,
   followed by HP-UX with 27%. 56% of companies with less than 50
   employees use Linux whereas it is used by 38% of firms with more than
   1,000 employees. In addition, 60% of the readers use Linux on their
   computers at home. Linux International, bod@li.org

  FXVOLUME 0.1, A SIMPLE XFORMS VOLUME CONTROL.
  
   
   
   Date: Wed, 13 Nov 1996
   
   
   Fxvolume is a simple, no frills volume control designed to sit at the
   side of your screen and not get in the way. You simply run it, and
   then ignore it until you need to use it.
   
   It controls the level of the master sound device under Linux, using a
   slider created from the Xforms library.
   
   http://www.ee.mu.oz.au/staff/pbd/linux/fxvolume/
   
   Use at your own risk - it has not been widely tested, but seems to
   work well enough... ;)

  UTIL-LINUX 2.6
  
   
   
   Date: Wed, 13 Nov 1996 util-linux-2.6.tar.gz (source only
   distribution)
   
   Util-linux is a suite of essential utilities for any Linux system.
   It's primary audience is system integrators (like the people at Red
   Hat) and DIY Linux hackers. The rest of you will get a digested
   version of util-linux installed with no risk to your sanity.
   
   Util-linux is attempting to be portable, but the only platform it has
   been tested much on is Linux/Intel. There have however been integrated
   several patches for Arm, m68k, and Alpha linux versions. The present
   version is known to compile on at least Linux 1.2/libc 4.7.5 and Linux
   2.0.22/Libc 5.3.12 (the Linux versions I run :-). People are
   encouraged to make _nice_ patches to util-linux and submit them to
   util-linux@math.uio.no.
   
   Util-Linux 2.6 is immediately available from
   ftp.math.uio.no:/pub/linux/util-linux-2.6
   
   
   NOTE: Before installing util-linux. READ the README or risk nuking
   your system. Thank you.

  LYX-0.10.7 - LYX IS A WYSIWYG
  
   
   
   Date: 30 Oct 1996
   LyX-0.10.7 has been uploaded to sunsite. It is also available from
   ftp://ftp.via.ecp.fr/pub/lyx and from my home page:
   http://www.lehigh.edu/~dlj0/LyriX.html
   
   LyX is a WYSIWYG front-end to LaTeX. It is used much like a
   word-processor, but LaTeX produces the final document. Figures,
   tables, mathematical formulas, fonts, headers, etc., are all drawn
   on-screen essentially as they appear on the final document. Figures
   (postscript) are placed in the document using a simple menu, as are
   tables. General text formatting is accomplished by high-level menu
   choices that automatically set fonts, indentation, spacing, etc.,
   according to general LaTeX rules, and display (essentially) these
   settings on the screen.
   
   None of the power of LaTeX is lost, since you can embed any LaTeX
   command within a LyX document.

  WGET, A WEB MIRRORING TOOL
  
   
   
   Date: Wed, 13 Nov 1996
   Wget 1.4.0 [formerly known as Geturl] is an extensive rewrite of
   Geturl. Wget should now be easier to debug, maintain and most
   importantly, use.
   
   Wget is a freely available network utility to download files from the
   World Wide Web using HTTP and FTP. It works non-interactively, thus
   enabling work in the background, after having logged off.
   
   Wget works under almost all modern Unix variants and, unlike many
   other similar utilities, is written entirely in C, thus requiring no
   additional software (like Perl). As Wget uses the GNU Autoconf, it is
   easily built on and ported to other Unix's. Installation procedure is
   described in the INSTALL file.
   
   You can get the latest version of wget at:
   ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/pub/unix/util/wget/wget.tar.gz

                   THE ADVENTURE OF UPGRADING TO REDHAT 4.0
                                       
                           (WITH ADVICE FOR OTHERS)
                                       
    By Randy Appleton, randy@EUCLID.ACS.nmu.edu
    
   
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
   
   
   Here at Northern Michigan University, we run a Linux lab with 14
   workstations. Upgrading from Redhat 3.0 to Redhat 4.0 has been quite
   an adventure. This article describes the upgrading of one workstation.
   
                                     TIME
                                       
   
   
   The first thing to do when upgrading is to free up a significant block
   of time. We used a day and a night to upgrade one machine. That
   included downloading the software, making floppy disks, and fixing our
   errors along the way. In fact, if you're a busy person, and Redhat 3.0
   is working fine for you, then you might choose to delay the upgrade,
   or even avoid it. However, at the Linux Lab at Northern Michigan, we
   try and stay near the cutting edge, so the upgrade was a must for us.
   
                                    METHOD
                                       
   
   
   The next step is to decide your upgrade method. The choices are the
   same ones from Redhat 3.0:
     * Upgrade from an NFS mounted directory of files.
     * Upgrade from a CD-ROM disk.
     * Upgrade from a spare partition containing the needed files.
     * Upgrade directly from an FTP site.
       
   
   
   The quickest and easiest way is to use the CD-ROM drive. This is the
   only way if you don't have a direct Internet connection, since you
   cannot download the necessary amount of data through a modem in any
   reasonable amount of time Since our workstations don't have CD-ROM
   drives, and do have an excellent Internet connection, we chose to do
   an FTP install.
   
                              DOWNLOAD BOOT DISKS
                                       
   
   
   Before an FTP install can begin, two disks named boot.img and supp.img
   must be downloaded from
   ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/current/i386/images/ . They can be
   written to the floppy disks with the commands
dd if=boot.img of=/dev/fd0 (switch disks)
dd if=supp.img of=/dev/fd0

   
   
   The second disk is only needed for an FTP install. Redhat 3.0 required
   three disks for all install types, so this change makes a significant
   savings in user effort. However, we had used the Redhat 3.0 disks as
   emergency boot disks to correct problems like forgetting the root
   password (yes, this does happen). The Redhat 4.0 boot disks are
   missing several important utilities (i.e. tar and vi) so cannot be
   used for this purpose.
   
   Also, notice that these two disks work for any supported hardware
   configuration. The older Redhat 3.0 required that the user search
   through a list of boot disks for the correct choice based on his
   hardware. This search often took more time than the download itself.
   Redhat 4.0 is much improved in this regard (our favorite new feature).
   
                       BOOTUP AND HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
                                       
   
   
   The first thing you'll see after inserting the boot.img disk and
   rebooting the computer is a LILO prompt. Just the words:
boot:

   
   
   We would have liked more explanation of our choices here. Redhat 3.0
   offered a very nice menu of help text that explained the possible
   parameters and their effects. However, if you just wait in a perplexed
   fashion long enough, the system will become impatient and boot Linux
   for you.
   
   The first difference you'll notice is that Redhat 4.0 prompts you to
   describe your hardware. It asks about SCSI controllers and network
   adapters, showing you a list of possible choices. Behind the scenes
   the Redhat 4.0 install script loads kernel modules to access your
   hardware.
   
   While this is happening is a good time to switch to virtual console #3
   (press <ALT>F3). This console shows what's happening in more technical
   detail, describing things like the mounting and unmounting of file
   systems, and the downloading of files. The older Redhat 3.0 did not
   have this feature, which we often use to debug problems. You can
   switch back to the main action by pressing <ALT>F1.
   
   The install scripts also query the user for network information. You
   should know your IP number, netmask, gateway, hostname, domain name,
   and name server before starting the install. We notice that Redhat 4.0
   creates a default gateway and name server entry based upon your IP
   number and netmask, but that these defaults are rarely right. Better
   in our opinion would be to have no default at all than a misleading
   one.
   
                            CHOOSING YOUR SOFTWARE
                                       
   
   
   Redhat 4.0 will show you a menu of possible software upgrades and
   additions. This list is essentially the same as Redhat 3.0, except
   that most packages have increased in version number.
   
   The biggest problem we had involved the remote login software (rlogin,
   in.rlogind, in.rshd and in.telnetd). These have been upgraded to use
   the P.A.M. library and kerberos. However, we often login into our
   Linux workstations from older Sun Sparcs that do not run this software
   suite. For some unexplained reason, the SunOS clients could not access
   the Linux servers. We solved the problem by simply re-installing the
   older software.
   
   In general, we suggest letting Redhat upgrade everything you might
   ever use. You should avoid downloading any software you are sure you
   will not need. Avoiding unneeded software will decreases the total
   time needed and the probability of network errors during the download.
   
                            THE LONG LONG DOWNLOAD
                                       
   
   
   Step one of the download process is to pick an FTP site. There are
   many listed here. We started by choosing a site with a fast 'ping
   time' from us, since ping time is a reasonable approximation of
   FTP throughput and is quite quick to gather. To find out the ping tome
   to a site like www.redhat.com, just type:
ping www.redhat.com

   
   
   After ping runs for several packets, kill it with <CNTL>C. The average
   ping time will be shown at the bottom. We saw ping times from 80 - 300
   milliseconds. Downloads are four times faster from the best site
   compared to the worst. It is well worth your time to explore sing ping
   before picking a site at random. The fastest was the aptly named
   ftp://ftp.real-time.com/pub/redhat . Unfortunately, they were not
   accepting FTP connections, so we used
   ftp://uicarhive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/systems/linux/distributions/redhat
   . We could FTP to that site, but the download failed. It seems that
   the download scripts also want to know the version and architecture of
   the packages you are trying to download. Therefore, the correct URL is
   ftp://uicarhive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/systems/linux/distributions/redhat/cu
   rrent/i386. That was not obvious from the directions. We suggest that
   the Redhat folks either change their script to add these
   subdirectories or make their directions more clear.
   
   For us, upgrading required downloading over 300 megabytes. I must say
   the status screen during the download is quite nice. The biggest
   problem with it is that it does not show the progress of downloading
   each package. Since the download was so long, we left it running
   overnight. Unfortunately, it failed on the download of LILO. The
   download script then waited for us to press a key acknowledging the
   error, which meant it stopped downloading some time during the night.
   Better would be to continue downloading while informing the user of
   this error.
   
   Once the download is finished, and you answer a few simple questions,
   you get to reboot your computer into Redhat 4.0 (yea!!).
   
                              THE UPGRADED SYSTEM
                                       
   
   
   The first thing we noticed is that the kernel has been upgraded to
   Linux 2.0.19. Some problems we had before, like our tape drive not
   working, were fixed with this upgrade. Also, our Adaptec 2740 SCSI
   controller was accessible for the first time. Java support is included
   in the upgraded kernel.
   
   We discovered the auto-mounter daemon (amd) was running, and had
   created a directory named /proc. Inside /proc is every computer
   mountable by your workstation. For example, /proc/foo is the root
   directory of the host foo, assuming foo will allow outside access.
   Nice feature!!
   
   The ps command has been changed. Formerly, we used 'ps -augx' to see
   all processes on our system. That command will no longer work. The new
   equivalent is 'ps -ax'.
   
   The passwd command has been changed. In fact, my former password is
   now considered ill advised, and I've had to pick a new password.
   
   The window manager fvwm95 has been included in the upgraded Redhat.
   Surprisingly, workman, the musical CD player, was not. See
   http://www.redhat.com/linux-info/pkglist/rh40_i386/all-packages.html
   for the complete list.
   
   Happily, the Redhat 4.0 upgrade left much of our custom configuration
   intact. For example, we run a custom X server that Redhat left in
   place, and our NFS mounts as described in /etc/fstab were retained,
   even though the upgrade did change /etc/fstab to add other entries
   (like the /net file system). We did have to re-edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local
   to set our NIS domain.
   
                         THE ERRATA AND OTHER UPGRADES
                                       
   
   
   The errata can be found at
   http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl/rh40-errata-general.html . It
   is actually quite long. Basically, the errata is a list of package
   upgrades to Redhat 4.0, along with a description of applicability. We
   counted up to 40 packages to download and install, depending on your
   configuration. That just too many!! Why does not Redhat make these
   improved packages a part of the latest redhat release, possibly called
   Redhat 4.0.1?
   
   Luckily, the process is quite mechanical, and requires little thought.
   Just download the needed files, and run rpm -U on them.
   
   Netscape has upgraded since we did our original install.
   Unfortunately, Redhat does not include Netscape, so Netscape must be
   updated separately. Perhaps there are legal reasons Redhat does not
   include Netscape, but Redhat does include other non-free software,
   such as xv.
   
   During the upgrade, the install scripts creates backup copies of
   certain files in /etc/rc.d/rc*.d with the extension ".rpmsave". Once
   everything is set up correctly, you can delete any files in
   /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/*.rpmsave.
   
                             THE FINISHED PRODUCT
                                       
   
   
   Overall, the Redhat package is well done. The installation is easier
   for Redhat than any other Unix we know of. Redhat 4.0 is a collection
   of small upgrades of many packages from Redhat 3.0. There are only a
   few new packages (i.e.: fvwm95, TheNextLevel). Overall, our system is
   much as it was before, but with many small improvements. Unless you
   have some need to upgrade, or just feel like messing around with your
   system, we suggest the results may not be worth the effort. Even so,
   we like Redhat 4.0 very much.

Features of the TCSH Shell

    By Jesper Kjær Pedersen, blackie@imada.ou.dk
    
   
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
Abstract

     
     
     In this article, I will describe some of the main features of TCSH,
     which I believe makes it worth using as the primary login shell.
     This article is not meant to persuade bash users to change! I've
     never used bash, and by that reason I know very little about it.
     
     As some of you surely know, I've created a configuration tool called
     The Dotfile Generator, which can configure TCSH. I believe that this
     tool is very handy when one wants to get the most out of TCSH
     (without reading the manual page a couple of times.) Because of that
     I'll refer to this tool several times throughout this article to
     show how it can be used to set up TCSH.
     
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Why is the shell so important?

   The shell is your interface to executing program, managing files and
   directories etc. Though very few people are aware of it, one uses the
   shell very much in the daily work. E.g. completing file names, using
   history substitution and aliases. The TCSH shell offers all of these
   features and a few more, which the average user very seldom takes
   advantages of.
   
   With a high knowledge of your shell's power, you may decrease the time
   you need to spend in the shell, and increase the time spent on the
   original tasks
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Command line completions

   An important feature that is used by almost all users of a shell is
   the command line completion. With this feature you don't need to type
   all the letters of a filename, but only the ambiguous ones. This means
   that if you wish to edit a file called file.txt, you may only need to
   type fi and hit the TAB key, then the shell will type the rest of the
   filename for you.
   
   Basically one can complete on files and directories. This means that
   you can not complete on host names, process id's, options for a given
   program etc. Another thing you can not do with this type of completion
   is to complete on directory names only, when typing the argument for
   the command cd
   
   In TCSH, the completion mechanism is enhanced so that it is possible
   to tell TCSH which list to complete from for each command. This means
   that you can tell TCSH to complete from a list of host names when
   completing on the commands rlogin and ping. An alternative is to tell
   it to complete only on directories when the command is cd.
   
   To configure user defined completion with The Dotfile Generator (from
   now on called TDG) go to the page completion -> userdefined, this will
   bring up a page which looks like this:
   
   [IMAGE]
   
   As the command name, you tell TDG which command you wish to define a
   completion for. In this example it is rm. Next you have to tell TDG
   which arguments to the command, this completion should apply to. To do
   this, press the button labeled Position definition. This will bring up
   a page, which is split in two parts:
   
   [IMAGE] In the first part, you tell TDG, that the position definition,
   should be defined from the index of the argument, which is trying to
   be completed (the one, where the tab key is pressed.) Here you can
   tell it that you wish to complete on the first argument, all the
   arguments except the first one etc.
   
   [IMAGE] The alternative to position dependent completion is pattern
   dependent completion. This means that you can tell TDG, that this
   completion should only apply if the current word, the previous word or
   the word before the previous word conform with a given pattern. Now
   you have to tell the TDG which list to complete from. To do this press
   the button labeled List. This will bring up a page, where you can
   select from a lot of different lists. E.g. aliases, user names, or
   directories.
   
  FILES AND DIRECTORIES
  
   Four of the lists you can select from are Commands, Directories, File
   names and Text files. If you give the optional directory to any of
   these, only elements from this directory is used.
   
  PREDEFINED LISTS
  
   There are two ways to let completion be from a predefined list. One is
   to mark the option predefined list, and type all the options in this
   list.
   
   This solution is a bad idea if the list is used several places (e.g. a
   list of host names) in that case, one should select the list to be
   located in a variable, and then set this variable in the .tcshrc file.
   
  OUTPUT FROM COMMAND
  
   In many cases the list should be calculated when the completion takes
   place. This could e.g. be a list of users located at a given host, or
   targets in a makefile.
   
   To set up such a completion, first develop the command, which return
   the list to complete from. The command must return the completion list
   on standard output as a space separated list. When this is done,
   insert this command in the entry saying Output From Command.
   
   Here's a little Perl command, which find the targets in a makefile:
perl -ne 'if (/^([^.#][^:]+):/) {print "$1 "}' Makefile

   If this is inserted in the Entry, one can complete on targets from the
   file called Makefile, in the current working directory.
   
   If someone should think that its only to promote TDG, that I describe
   TCSH through it, (s)he should take a look at the following line, which
   is the generated code for the make completion:

complete make  'p@*@`perl -ne '"'"'if (/^([^.#][^:]+):/) {print "$1"}'"'"'Makef
ile`@'

  RESTRICT TO PATTERN
  
   With user defined completion, you can restrict the files, which are
   matched, for each command. Here are some very useful examples:
   
   Restrict latex to *.{tex,dtx,ins}
          The latex command will only complete on files ending in .tex,
          .dtx or .ins
          
   Restrict rm to ^*.{tex,html,c,h}
          
          This means that you can not complete rm to a .tex, .html, .c or
          .h file!
          I've done that a few times, when I e.g. wanted to delete a file
          called important.c~. Since the file important.c existed tcsh
          only completed to that name, and.. I deleted the wrong file,
          because I was to quick :-(
          
  ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES
  
   Additional examples can be obtained from TDG, if you load the export
   file distributed with TDG. Please note that if you wish to keep the
   other pages, you have to tell TDG only to import the page
   completion/userdefined. This is done on the Details page, which is
   accessible from the reload page.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Configuring the prompt

   Configuring the prompt is very easy with TDG. Just enter the menu
   called prompt. On this page you can configure three prompts:
   
   prompt
          This is the usual prompt, which you see on the command line,
          where you are about to enter a command.
          
   prompt2
          This prompt is used in foreach, and while loops, and at lines
          continuing lines ended with a slash.
          
   prompt3
          This prompt is used when TCSH tries to help you, when it meet
          commands it doesn't know (called spell checking.)
          
   The prompts are mixed with tokens and ordinary text. The tokens are
   inserted by clicking on them in the menu below the scrollbar, and the
   ordinary text is simply typed in. When a token is inserted an
   indication will be shown in the entry. Here's an example of how this
   may look:
   
   [IMAGE]
   
   [IMAGE] As has been discussed in issue6 of the Gazette, some of the
   prompt may be located in the xterm title bar instead of on the command
   line. To do this, choose font change and select Xterm.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
History

   The history mechanism of the shell is a valuable thing, which makes it
   easier to type similar commands after each other.
   
   To see a list of the previously executed commands, type history.
   
   The following table lists the event specifiers:
   
   !nThis refers to the history event, with index n !-nThis refers to the
   history event, which was executed, n times ago: !-1 for the previous
   command, !-2 for the one before the previous command etc. !!This
   refers to the previous command !#This refers to the current command
   !sThis refers to the most recent command, whose first word begins with
   the string s !?s?This refers to the most recent command, which contain
   the sting s
   
   With these commands, you can re-execute a command. E.g. just type !!,
   to re-execute the previous command. This is however often not what you
   want to do. What you really wants is to re-execute some part of a
   previous command, with some new elements added. To do this, you can
   use one of the following word designators, which is appended to the
   event specifier, with a colon.
   
   0The first word (i.e. the command name) nThe nth word $The last
   argument %The word matched by an ?s? search x-yArgument range from x
   to y *All the arguments to the command (equal to ^-$)
   
   Now it's possible to get the last argument from the previous command,
   by typing !!:$. You'll however often see that you very often refer to
   the previous command, so if no event specifier is given, the previous
   command is used. This means that instead of writing !!:$, you may only
   write !$.
   
   More words designators exists, and it's even possible to edit the
   words with different commands. For more information about this and for
   more examples, please take a look into the tcsh manual
   
   [IMAGE] It is possible to expand the history references on the command
   line before you evaluate them by pressing ESC-SPC or ESC-! (This is:
   first the escape key, and next the space key or the ! key). On some
   keyboards you may use the meta key instead of the escape key. I.e.
   M-SPC (One keystroke!)
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Patterns

   Many operations in the shell often works on many files, e.g. all files
   ending with .tex or starting with test-. Tcsh has the opportunity to
   type all these files for you, with file patterns. The following list
   shows which possibilities there exists:
   
   *Match any number of characters ?Match a single character [...]Match
   any single character in the list [x-y]Match any character within the
   range of characters from x to y [^...]Match elements, which does not
   match the list {...}This expands to all the words listed. There's no
   need that they match. ^...^ in the beginning of a pattern negates the
   pattern.
   
  EXAMPLES
  
   match all files ending with .tex
          *.tex
          
   match all files which does not end with .tex
          ^*.tex
          
   match xxxabyy xxxcdeyy and xxxhifjyy
          xxx{ab,cde,hifj}yy
          
   match all .c and .h files
          *.[ch] or *.{c,h}
          
  THE SHELL EXPAND PATTERNS
  
   An important thing to be aware of is that it is the shell, which
   expand the patterns, and not the programs, which is executed with the
   pattern.
   
   An example of this is the program mcopy which copy files from disk. To
   copy all files, you may wish to use a star as in: mcopy a:* /tmp. This
   does however not work since the shell will try to expand the star, and
   since it can not find any files, which starts with a:, it will signal
   an error. So if you wish to send a star to the program, you have to
   escape the star: mcopy a:\* .
   
   [IMAGE] There exists two very useful key bindings, which can be used
   with patterns: The first is C-xg, which list all the files matching
   the pattern, without executing the command. The other is C-x*, which
   expand the star on the command line. This is especially useful if you
   e.g. wishes to delete all files ending in .c except important.c,
   stable.c and another.c. To create a pattern for this, might be very
   hard, so just use the pattern *.c. Then type C-x*, which will expand
   *.c to all you .c files. Now it's easy to remove the three files from
   the list
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Aliases

   When using the shell one will soon recognize that certain commands are
   typed again and again. The one at top ten is surly ls -la, which list
   all files in a directory in long form.
   
   TCSH has a mechanism to create aliases for commands. This means that
   you can create an alias for ls -la just called la.
   
   Aliases may refer to the arguments of the command line. This means
   that you can create a command called pack, which take a directory name
   and pack the directory with tar and gz. etc. Aliases can often be a
   bit hard to create since one often wants history/variable references
   expanded at time of use, and not at the definition time. This has been
   done easier with TDG, so go to the page aliases, to define aliases. If
   you end up with an alias you can not define on this page, but in tcsh,
   please send me an email. For more information about aliases, see the
   tcsh manual
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Timing programs

   Have you ever needed to know how long a program took to run, how much
   CPU it used etc?. If so, you may recognize the output from the tcsh
   built-in time command:

0.020u 0.040s 0:00.11 54.5%     0+0k 0+0io 21pf+0w

   Informative? Yes but... The gnu time command is a bit more
   understandable:

0.01user 0.08system 0:00.32elapsed 28%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+0minor)pagefaults 0swaps

   But still...
   
   In TDG you can configure the output from the time command on the page
   called jobs. It looks like this:
   
   [IMAGE]
   
   As for the prompt, here's an entry once again for mixed tokens and and
   ordinary text. Remember, if there is something in TDG that you do not
   understand, help is available by pressing the right mouse button over
   the given widget.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
References

   As you may have guessed, TDG and this article will help you a lot of
   the way to use TCSH, BUT you may need to read a bit more to get more
   out of TCSH, here's a few references:

2. Introduction

   
   
   Welcome as a future fellow of feddi and bt :-)
   
   Congratulations for your decision to install this package. It's not
   too complicated, the only troubles you may run in are some
   permissions. The sources included in this package have already been
   patched to grant a smoother working.
   
   As well fmbedit as bt show some minor problems, so don't flame as much
   and think that you didn't pay anything for it. You may contribute
   correcting bugs. Don't hold them for yourself, share them. Send me
   patches and will make this software improve. A hint: don't run it
   under X, the terminal data base doesn't work smoothly, I'm up to fix
   this. Surely, some day I'll be able to path this :-) (I used to say
   this would be the next :-DDDDDDDDDDD)
   
   I'm in due with:
   
     * Alfonso Belloso : 2:344/17.2 (if I remember well)
     * Jose Luis Sanchez : 2:346/207.17 (for sure)
     * Pablo Gomez : 2:341/43.12 (fixes for this file and the scripts for
       the automation of the personal area)
     * Javier Ruberte : 2:346/401.50
     * Jose Carlos Gutierrez : 2:341/45.17 (scripts to compile the
       nodelist)
     * Carlos Terron : 2:345/402.23 (patch so ftoss recognizes
       upper/lower
     * Francisco Jose Montilla : 2:345/402.22 pacopepe@nova.es(sgml
       format)
     * CICCIO C. Simon : ciccio@arrakis.es (english version)
       
   
   
   At the end of this file you'll find messages with hints, all sent by
   feddi

3. Installing FEddi

3.1 User installation fido.

   
   
   We'll install fido as a mail user, but you can give it another name.
   
   If you see ~/ in this document, we refer to the user's home directory.
   
   
     * file /etc/passwd Include the following line:

fido::2004:300::/home/fido:/bin/bash
     * file /etc/group Include the following line:

fido::300:uucp,fido,root

3.2 Necessary packages

   
   
   You'll need:
   
     * perl, do

ls /usr/bin/perl
   If not found, install it from disk-set D (Slackware)
     * ncurses, do

ls /usr/lib/libncurses.a
   If not found, install it from disk-set D (Slackware)
       
3.3 mailer installation/configuration.

   
   
   Change to the directory /FEddi-0.9pl5
   
    1. Edit the file Makefile, put for variable SRCDIR your fonts' path,
       e.g.:

SRCDIR=/root/trabajo/mailer/FEddi-dev
    2. Add to the beginning of the line NODEPRG =: nlfunct.o else it
       won't compile.
    3. make
    4. If you get the following error:

ncurses.h: No such file or directory
   Do:

ln -s /usr/include/ncurses/curses.h /usr/include/ncurses/ncurses.h
    5.

su root
make install
exit
    6. It seems that the install utility doesn't copy all of the
       utilities; do the following:

cp utils/* ~/fnet/utility
    7. A few files need modification:
          + File printmsg


#!/bin/sh
cat | $HOME/fnet/utility/formatmsg | lpr
          + File exportmsg


#!/bin/sh
if test $1 = "new"
  then
        cat | $HOME/fnet/utility/formatmsg > "$2"
  else
        cat | $HOME/fnet/utility/formatmsg >> "$2"
fi
    8. The fnet directory has the following contents:

./outbound
./msgbase
./copy
./log
./inbound
./utility
./nodelist
   Create these directories and do the following:

chown -R fido.fido fnet
    9. Configuration file ~/.feddirc:
          + Permissions 644
          + User/group fido.uucp

;

   You may base your configuration on this file, as it works for me
       without troubles.
   10. File ~/fnet/nodelist/fnlcrc

dial    34-6-   3
dial    34-6
dial    *

pointlist       ptlstr34
pointlist       eu_point

nodelist        region34
nodelist        eu_nodes
   dial : According to your zone 34-6 (Valencia), 34-1 (Madrid), 34-3
       (Barcelona), etc... As pointlist, the different lists of points,
       you may use the point lists that come from the bbs, without
       modification. As nodelist, the different lists of nodes, you may
       use the node lists that come from the bbs, without modification.
       That's it.
   11. Compiling the nodelist/pointlist I'm using the following scripts.
       They are simple and work.
          + file ~/fnet/nodelist/compila0 permissions 777

#!/bin/bash
unzip lista.zip
mv EU_NODOS* eu_nodos
mv EU_PUNTO* eu_punto
mv PTLSTR34* ptlstr34
mv REGION34* region34
mv SNETLIST* snetlist
mv SUBPTLST* subptlst
          + file ~/fnet/nodelist/compila1 permissions 777

#!/bin/bash
rm fnlc.*
fnlc
   This will compile the lists. If you run into troubles, certainly it's
       about permissions. Check four files, normally the binaries go to
       /usr/bin
       
3.4 Check and usage.

   
   
   Check your mail. Look for a mail package you might have for MS/DOS.
   Put it into the directory ~/fnet/inbound and do
   

ftoss ; futility pack ; futility link

   
   
   This will always be the way to handle your incoming mail. ftoss will
   create automatically the folder according to your areas.
   

fmbedit

   
   
   If everything went well you'll see the mail of that package on your
   screen :-)
   
   The editor is quite simple and well documented. It looks somewhat like
   the fmail's editor.
   
   Create a message in an area or two and do the following:
   

fscan

   
   
   This will always be the way to handle your outgoing mail.

4.2 Problems

   
   
   If you run into troubles, for sure it's about permissions or a badly
   defined path. Check them out.
   
    1. The most common error is:

cannot re-open logfile
   The owner is usually: usuario.uucp. The permissions: 664
    2. Another rather common error: Here it might be that the assigned
       tty doesn't have the appropriate permissions. Specially if this
       had been used by getty, normally it should get permissions to read
       and write for everybody. The message was:

tty port can not be initialized
   Solution:

chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0
   or ttyS1; (COM1: or COM2:).
    3. For RedHat users:

ln -s /var/spool /usr

   
   
   If you get a screen similar to frodo you could do the following:
   
   ALT-Y, call your bbs, it'll leave your mail there and fetch what you
   got. Then you just need to execute the commands mentioned for mail
   handling.
   
   If it appears to have fallen asleep during the FIRST file
   transmission, hit the ESC key to wake it up.

Hi.

For now, FEddi hasn't got too much documentation, so after a couple of
tests, finally I'm able to maintain the message base.

        futility tool delete "age+15&&protect-&&new-" R34.LINUX
        futility pack

This will delete the messages older than 15 days which are not protected
and which have been read.

If you don't specify the area name, it'll refer to all. It happens that
I leave some areas more days than others, so I have to specify a line for
each area, but my customize it at will.

Bye.

Hi!

I have been trying to find out how to do the RE: with the Linux software,
and I already fetched my first file. I'll explain how I did it, just if
anybody is interested, or knows about a more correct manner.

First I write a Net, usually to my sysop. After finishing I exit with
(Alt+x). Having the message activated, I hit (Alt+g) to open a small
window which displays some data. Once seeing it, I pulse `Inc' and type
the name of the file I wish to download. Finally I push `Esc'.

This should be enough. Next time you call you'll receive the file. At
least this is how it worked for me.

Any comments?

Bye,
  Javier

This causes that, inserting a net instead of writing a To:, push PgUp or
PgDown, you can see the different names. As you see, I've even added some
Internet addresses which I'm using sometimes. The first field, I think, is
some kind of short keys to make a call directly to this line. I don't remember
right now how is this done, but it's easy and you'll find it in the man page
for feddi.

I don't know if I missed something. If you agree, just add it to feddi.como.
Let me know if you think there is missing something, I'll send it to you.

See ya.

Message Number 1358 from area R34.LINUX

From: Pablo Gomez (2:341/43.40)
From: All
Subj: The personal area in FEDDI, a fine(ally) version ;-)
Send: 24 Jun 96  00:35:31
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi!

Will since some time we have been trying to find out a possibility to provide
in FEDDI a personal area allowing the reception of mail directed to us
from any area, and, over all, (as the former isn't difficult) reply them
in a comfortable way, sending them back to the original areas.

The following scripts at least allowed Francisco Jose Montilla and the author
of this message to do the trick.

The first step is creating an area which will later serve as PERSONAL.
We can do it like:

(As user fido)

$ cd ~/msgbase
$ mkdir +PERSONAL
$ cp +R34.LINUX/* +PERSONAL/

(PERSONAL is the name you want to give the personal area) Check if the
permissions and the owner of this new directory are the same as those
you have in other areas. If not, correct them.

Next, to clean the messages, do:

$ futility "+delete" "all+" PERSONAL
$ futility pack PERSONAL

If you invoke fmbedit again, you'll the the new area, called PERSONAL!
:-) magic? :-)

Now we've got the base. Next part: Copy the new messages that are arriving
to the system to our name. This is done (almost) automatically.

If we create a file like:

                                      ,,,
                                     (o o)  File: ~/msgbase/tosspath
---*reiss*------*schnippel*------oOO--(_)--OOo-------*knabber*-----*fetz*---

copy    t"Pablo Gomez" PERSONAL

---*reiss*------*schnippel*--------------------------*knabber*-----*fetz*---

that's it. Obviously you'll have to replace my name (Pable Gomez) with yours,
and PERSONAL with the name of your personal area. Each time we run ftoss,
this will copy to the personal area the messages directed to us.

This point deserves a comment. In fact, this will copy also the messages
directed to us and received in NETMAIL. In my opinion, this is somewhat
brain-dead, as the NETMAIL area is already our personal area. I don't know
of no modification to avoid this copy. So a little later we'll have to
make a certain adjustment.

This is a piece (the important one ;-)) of the script I run to receive the
mail.
                                      ,,,
                                     (o o)  File: ~/bin/mimport
---*reiss*------*schnippel*------oOO--(_)--OOo-------*knabber*-----*fetz*---
#!/bin/sh

# To manage the personal area
PERSAREA=PERSONAL

# Mail import
ftoss

#
# Feeding personal area
# We just have delivered the messages, generating the necessary duplicates in
# PERSONAL. But we'd liked to delete the messages which we just copied to
# the PERSONAL area, and which come from the NETMAIL area
#
futility tool "+delete" \
  "new+&&text+\*\*\* ftoss: copied from NETMAIL" $PERSAREA


# reconstruct threads
futility pack
futility link

#[...]
---*reiss*------*schnippel*--------------------------*knabber*-----*fetz*---

Be careful: the lines `futility tool ...' and `new ..." are just one. The
aim is to delete this redundant messages from NETMAIL.


Going on with message handling. The messages in the PERSONAL area contain
lines like:

*** ftoss: copied from R34.LINUX

(for instance) :-)

I reply (just in the PERSONAL area) the message, and don't care for anything,
_EXCEPT_ to not delete this line, which will serve later as a `witness' to
allow the message be replied in the correct area.

Then, exporting the mail, I run the following script:
                                      ,,,
                                     (o o)  File: ~/bin/mexport
---*reiss*------*schnippel*------oOO--(_)--OOo-------*knabber*-----*fetz*---
#!/bin/sh

USER_BIN_DIR=/home/fido/bin
LOCAL_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin
# Name of personal area
PERSAREA=PERSONAL

# user name
USERNOM="Pablo Gomez"

# temp output file name
OUTFILE=/tmp/persanswr




# Extraction of the messages in the personal area which are due for process
# and which will then be marked as `sent'
#
futility tool "display" "attribute-se&&from+Pablo Gomez" $PERSAREA > $OUTFILE
futility tool "+se" "attribute-se&&from+Pablo Gomez" $PERSAREA

# distribution to the new areas...
awk -f $USER_BIN_DIR/persreply.awk < $OUTFILE

# scan the message base
#
$LOCAL_BIN_DIR/fscan
---*reiss*------*schnippel*--------------------------*knabber*-----*fetz*---

And the `awk' line included in the file persreply.awk reads:

                                      ,,,
                                     (o o)  File: ~/bin/persreply.awk

Be careful: there are cut off lines (visibly), and there is a double hack
which I wasn't able to resolve better. Instead of defining all of the above
variables, there is one, `outputfile' which I had to redefine half way of
the script as a constant, because I didn't know how to do it better. I tried
to pass the variable quoted in different styles, but I couldn't achieve it.
Maybe one of you could give me a hint.

This was tested with several simultaneous messages, but I think I never
failed to destroy the line with ***ftoss...

Regards until the next time. I hope you'll find it useful. I'll be pleased
to get comments, improvements, etc.

 * Origin: Puntomatico Remoto. Linux en Hoyo de Manzanares (2:341/43.40)

5.6 A few `tricks' for those that don't agree with RTFM.

  REPLYING MAIL.
  
   
   
     * To reply -in the normal way- the From: in the same area, Alt+r
     * To reply the To: in the same area as the message: Ctrl+r.
     * To reply -via net- the message's From: Alt+n
     * To reply -via net- the message's To: Ctrl+n
       To be able to do the latter, the addressee must be in the
       pointlist, otherwise just nothing happens.
       
  ``NAVIGATING'' AROUND THE MESSAGE BASE.
  
   
   
     * To get a list of the areas messages, pulse Alt+l; using then the
       cursor right key, you'll be changing to the list of areas.
     * To follow the conversation's thread upon it's Re:, you'll need to
       hit the Tab key, and see a list similar to that which appears in
       the previous item. If you continue using this key you'll change
       the references to the linked messages.
       You will know that there multiple linked messages (this is what
       futility link does) by one and the same Re: and by some yellow
       codes which appear in the right upper corner of the screen, in the
       zone dedicated to the message's header.
       
  FILE OPERATIONS
  
   
   
     * To do a File Attach, or sending a file ``attached'' to a message,
       netmail, -once the addressee has been typed- push Alt+y,
       followed by f; then Alt+j and finally Tab; you'll be able to
       ``navigate'' up to the file.
       The latter Tab applies to all operations related to files(insert
       file, export message to file, etc...)
       
5.7 Grouping by tens Binkley's appearance:

   
   
     * Create the following file and execute it in place of the bt:
       File /usr/bin/bbs

echo -e "\033(U"
/usr/bin/bt
echo -e "\033(B"
     * Type the command:

chmod 755 /usr/bin/bbs
     * Edit /usr/lib/binkley/binkley.cfg changing the value of the line
       BoxType to 3:

    O'Reilly releases The Linux Multimedia Guide.
    
    indent I recently picked up my copy of The Linux Multimedia Guide by
   Jeff Tranter. This text covers a wide range of material related to the
   creation and use of multimedia files with respect to the Linux
   operating system. The text is approximately 350 pages, including
   source code listings for a number of sample multimedia applications
   which are discussed in one chapter of the book. As usual, O'Reilly
   provides copies of the source from their ftp site.
   indent When I first found out about this book I thought "Rats, Jeff
   beat me too it." Much of what Jeff covers is listed in my own Linux
   Graphics mini-Howto. However, there are quite a number of items not
   covered by the LGH (as I call it), such as audio, a bit more detail
   about video formats and tools, and programming considerations for
   various hardware (CD-ROMs, joysticks, and sound devices), which make
   the Linux Multimedia Guide a good addition to the O'Reilly family of
   Unix books.
   indent The text is divided into 5 sections:
    1. Introduction to Multimedia
    2. User's Guide
    3. A Survey of Multimedia Applications
    4. Multimedia Programmer's Guide
    5. Appendices
       
   The first section introduces the reader to the various concepts
   involved with multimedia such as the CD-ROMs, image file formats, and
   sound files. The chapters here are generally brief but the one on
   audio is quite informative. There is a discussion on audio file
   formats as well as a comparison of a few of the popular sound cards
   available for Linux.
   indent Section two opens with a discussion on hardware requirements
   for doing multimedia on Linux systems. Most of this section centers on
   either the CD-ROM driver or the Linux Sound Driver (now known as OSS).
   There is also a short chapter on the joystick driver.
   indent The second longest section, A Survey of Multimedia
   Applications, covers applications for the various forms of multimedia.
   There are chapters on sound and music applications, graphics and
   animations applications, hypermedia applications, and games. The last
   chapter, on games, seems a bit out of place. There are games
   implemented as network applications using Java, JavaScript and the new
   Tcl/Tk plug-in for Netscape but this chapter doesn't cover these. This
   section is very similar to the LGH in that the chapters provide the
   program names and URLs associated with them (if any). The number of
   items covered is less than the LGH, but there are better descriptions
   of the applications in the book.
   indent Chapter fourteen opens the fourth section, the Multimedia
   Programmer's Guide. This section is the longest in the book and covers
   all the devices discussed earlier. Other chapters in this section
   cover some of the available toolkits available to multimedia
   developers. There is one chapter which contains three sample
   applications.
   indent In general I find the Linux Multimedia Guide a good reference
   text with a moderate degree of developer tutorials. Unlike many of the
   books available for Linux this text provides detailed explanation on
   the various programming interfaces, a useful tool beyond the simple
   "what is this and where do I get it" that many of the Howto's provide.
   The only drawback that I can see is that, like most of other Linux
   texts, this text does not provide a users perspective on any of the
   tools listed. If Linux is to ever go beyond a developer's-only
   platform there will need to be detailed users guides for the various
   well known applications. indent indent indent

    Textural Creations
    
    indent N ot long ago I got email from a reader of my Unix Graphics
   Utilities page asking this:
   
     I am just getting into the graphics scene and I have POV-Ray (for
     linux) and a few other programs. I know how to create an image with
     a modeller but how do apply texture and color to it?
     
   My answer was simple enough: It depends on what modeller you use and
   what renderer you use. POV-Ray for Linux doesn't have a modeller. You
   have to feed it a text file which contains both shapes and textures
   and POV-Ray will render (draw) it. There are 4 modellers that I know
   of for Linux: AC3D, AMAPI, SCED, and Midnight Modeller. SCED allows
   you to preview your image using various renderers. AC3D has a built in
   renderer, as does AMAPI. All three will output files that can be used
   by a number of renderers (such as POV-Ray, Radiance, PolyRay, RIB
   formats, etc). Modellers create shapes that are independent of the
   tools used to render the image.
   indent Modellers are great for creating shapes, but the textures
   applied to those shapes depend on what renderer you use. POV-Ray has
   its own set of commands that it uses for determining how a texture
   will look on an object in a scene. Commands for creating textures are
   different for other systems, like the procedural language (an actual
   programming language) used by BMRT (which conforms to the Renderman
   specification - i.e. the formats used by Pixar and their tools).
   indent So, the answer to the question is: it depends on what renderer
   you use. For POV-Ray you need to learn the command syntax for
   describing textures. If you can find a copy, pick up "Ray Tracing
   Creations" 2nd edition by Chris Young and Drew Wells. It may be out of
   print. This text has a good reference for the 2.2 version of POV-Ray.
   Although the texture commands were expanded for the 3.0 version, you
   can still create 2.2 based textures by providing the "#version 2.2"
   command in your POV-Ray source file. In this way you have a handy
   reference for learning how to create textures in POV-Ray. You still
   have to do this by hand, though. I've heard rumors that there may be a
   3.0 text eventually, but I don't have any word if that is true or not.
   
   indent As far as setting the textures from within the modeller, well,
   I don't think any of the modellers do that for you. You still have to
   manually set the textures (SCED allows you to do so from within the
   modeller, but I'm not sure the others do) using the command language
   of the particular renderer you're using. The reason for this goes back
   to what I said earlier: the format of the texture commands depends on
   what renderer you use.
   indent Its best to think of modelling and rendering as two separate
   tasks. If you want to preview your models you still need to run the
   renderers separately (except for SCED which will launch the renderer
   for you, but its still a separate program - the renderer is not part
   of the modeller).
   indent I know this is confusing. It was for me too. In fact, I gave up
   on modellers and now create my images by hand (I use vi to edit the
   .pov and .inc input files for POV-Ray). I've only recently started to
   look seriously again at modellers.
   
   Resources 
   The following links are just starting points for finding more
   information about computer graphics and multimedia in general for
   Linux systems. If you have some application specific information for
   me, I'll add them to my other pages or you can contact the maintainer
   of some other web site. I'll consider adding other general references
   here, but application or site specific information needs to go into
   one of the following general references and not listed here.

    Creating GIF Animations
    
   indent Recently, while working on a text on Unix web servers, I was
   tasked with writing about multimedia applications. During my research
   on this subject I discovered a little known fact about the GIF image
   file format: it supports multiple images in a single file which can be
   used to create animations. Creating GIF images is fairly simple. There
   a number of tools available for Linux systems that can either create
   new GIF images or convert image files in other formats to the GIF
   format. Tools such as the Gimp or XPaint can be used to create images
   while xv or the NetPBM tools can be used to convert images from other
   formats.
   indent In order to create a GIF animation you must first create a
   series of GIF images. These images make up the frames of the
   animation, much like cell animations make up a cartoon (although there
   is no reason why your GIF files can't be converted from 3D images such
   as those created with POV-Ray or BMRT). The animation only plays as
   fast the the host machines ability to read, decode and display the
   individual frames. On older 486 systems this might be a problem so its
   wise to keep your images small. For GIF images this means keeping the
   dimensions (height and width) of the animation small. You should also
   consider how jumpy you want the animation to be. Small amounts of
   movement of objects from frame to frame will reduce the jumpiness of
   the overall animation, but it also can significantly increase the
   overall size of the GIF file. Since Netscape (the only browser that I
   know of that currently supports this type of animation) tries to load
   the entire GIF file before it begins playing the animation it would be
   wise to consider keeping the file size small.
   indent Once you have the individual frames created, you'll need to put
   them all into a single GIF file. You can use a nifty little tool
   called WhirlGIF to do this. WhirlGIF is a command line tool (no GUI)
   that concatenates the series of GIF images into a single GIF image and
   configures the GIF header so that Netscape will know how to play the
   animation. The GIF header allows for a number of options, including
   some that are Netscape specific (Netscape didn't create their own
   format - the GIF format allows for application specific extensions).
   You can provide the number of times to loop the animation and the
   delay time to use between frames (which can be used to slow down and
   animation if so desired).
   indent There is a terrific page devoted to GIF animations at
   http://members.aol.com/royalef/gifanim.htm. This page is not Linux
   (or Unix) specific, but it does include pointers to WhirlGIF and the
   information in a number of the pages there are very applicable to
   creating GIF animations on Linux systems.

InfoZIP Archive Utilities

    By Robert G. "Doc" Savage, dsavage@accessus.net
    
   
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
   I'm a big fan of utilities. When I saw that CND/RHS were distributed
   with older versions of the InfoZIP zip/unzip suite of archive
   utilities, I made upgrading them my first Linux project. It turned out
   to be a little bit more complicated than I thought it would be.
   
   I especially wanted to add in the DES encryption modules to zip/unzip
   so they would be 100% file compatible with PKWare's archivers for
   MS-DOS. U.S. State Department rules make it difficult to implement
   this as an RPM, so I decided to do it as a classic shell script. The
   end user will have to ftp the source code (especially the DES code
   module) from the site specified in the script.
   
   
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
   Script #1:

#!/bin/sh
#
# undatezip reverses updatezip and restores a Caldera Network Desktop v1.0 or
# Red Hat Software v2.1/v3.0.3 InfoZIP suite installation to its original zip
# v2.01 and unzip v5.12 configuration.  This should only be necessary if you
# need to upgrade from a pristine as-installed configuration.
#
#       original versions       >>updatezip >>> new versions
#       without encryption



  __________________________________________________________________________




Script #2:

#!/bin/sh
#
# updatezip is a shell script for Caldera Network Desktop v1.0 or Red Hat
# Software's v2.1/v3.0.3 distributions to upgrade the InfoZIP utilities unzip
# from v5.12 to v5.2, and zip from v2.01 to v2.1.  It also adds the zcrypt DES
# encryption module not provided in the RHS (or any other) distribution.
#
# To undo this upgrade and restore a CND v1.0 or RHS v2.1/v3.0.3 installation
# to its original zip/unzip configuration, run the companion file undatezip.
#
#       original versions       >>updatezip >>> new versions
#       without encryption      :
#
#   unzip52.zip
#   zcrypt26.zip
#   zip21.zip
#
# Copy them and updatezip to a safe directory (suggest root's home directory
# /root).  Use 'chmod 700 updatezip' to make it executable, then run it.
# Execution time is slightly over four minutes on a DX4/100 system with 28M
# of RAM, a 32-bit EISA host adapter, and an older SCSI-1(CCS) hard drive.

                         SLANG APPLICATIONS FOR LINUX

  INTRODUCTION
  


John E. Davis of the Center for Space Research at MIT has written an
interpreted programming language called Slang, which has a C-like syntax. He
has written several programs using this language, including the slrn
newsreader and the emacs-like Jed editor.  Lately a few other programmers have
begun to make use of Slang; one reason for this is that Slang allows the use
of color in a text-mode program which will display equally well in an rxvt
window under X.



Applications which are linked with the Slang library always seem to be
text-mode programs.  Typically Linux text-mode applications use the ncurses
library to handle screen display.  Ncurses enables the use of menus, a certain
amount of color, and a more complex screen layout.  These traits don't always
translate well into an X-Windows environment; i.e. running in an xterm or rxvt
window. If an application is linked with the Slang library instead its
behavior is more consistent between the console and X sessions, especially
when started from an rxvt window.


  __________________________________________________________________________



  AN ASIDE CONCERNING RXVT AND XTERM
  


I get the impression that the xterm terminal emulator is used more commonly
than rxvt, though this may be due more to tradition than innate
superiority. Rxvt has been revised several times recently and in its current
form (version 2.19) has much to recommend it. One feature which I appreciate
is that it's memory usage is much lower than that of xterm.  Rxvt handles
color requests well, both background/foreground specifications and
extension-specific colorization such as "color-ls".  The most recent version
even allows the use of Xpm images as background, similar to a web-page, though
as with a web-page a background image would have to be carefully chosen so as
not to obscure the text.



Some xterm variants make use of color, but some don't.  I find the
plenitude of xterms and color-xterms rather confusing; it's hard to tell just
which ones you have, and they vary from distribution to distribution.  Then
there is xterm's Tektronix compatibility, which I've never seen a use for.
Reading the xterm man page I get the impression that xterm was developed for
older mainframe-and-terminal systems.


  __________________________________________________________________________



  APPLICATIONS WHICH USE SLANG
  
    1. Slrn is a fast, high quality news-reader which supports threading
       of messages, decoding of MIME attachments, and has the ability to
       tell a web-browser to load a URL contained within a message. It
       has many other features and options; it is one of John Davis's
       programs and he actively supports it in the newsgroup
       news.software.readers.
    2. Lynx, the text-mode web-browser, looks less archaic when compiled
       with Slang support. If you can't see the images on a page, at
       least the text elements and background can be nicely colored!
    3. Jed, John Davis's emacs-like editor, is surprisingly capable
       considering it is a fraction of the size of any real emacs. If
       you've ever hesitated to start up Gnu Emacs or Xemacs just to read
       an info page, try Jed; it reads them just as well and is quicker
       to invoke. Jed has syntax-highlighting for a variety of file
       types.
    4. The Midnight Commander, the exemplary text-mode file-manager, now
       includes enough of the Slang files in its source distribution to
       compile with Slang screen management without Slang libraries on
       your system. Slang is the default in recent versions of MC and the
       two are well-matched.
    5. Minicom is available in a binary, Slang-enabled version at
       ftp://sunsite.unc.edu. Color really makes this classic comm
       program more usable, especially in an rxvt window.
    6. The Mutt mail program is an interesting offshoot of Elm
       development which is well on its way toward becoming an
       alternative to Pine and Elm. Slang is listed as an alternative to
       ncurses in the pre-compilation configure script options, but I
       can't say how well it works as it will only successfully compile
       with ncurses on my system.
    7. Dosemu, though still dubbed an alpha version by the development
       team, is remarkably stable and useful. Recently I compiled the
       latest version (I had been using an old RPM version) and was
       surprised to see that the configure script looks for the Slang
       library. After the compilation I ran ldd against the dos binary
       and found that it is dynamically linked with the Slang library.
       Interesting! I looked through the source code and docs to see if
       there was any information on Dosemu's use of Slang, but finally
       gave up. You could spend days wandering around the Byzantine
       directory hierarchy of Dosemu!
   

  __________________________________________________________________________





I'm sure as the benefits of Slang become more widely known we shall see
more text-mode applications with Slang support included.  There very well be
others than the above-listed out there; these are just the ones I've run
across.


  __________________________________________________________________________



  AVAILABILITY
  


Precompiled binaries for slrn, lynx, and the Jed editor (with Slang
statically linked, I assume) are available at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu and its
mirrors .  I used these for some time, but recently I obtained the source for
Slang and compiled a shared library.  The advantage of this approach is that
you can compile binaries which dynamically link the Slang library at runtime.
Your executables will be smaller, and one shared library can service any
number of Slang-using applications. Another advantage to obtaining the source
distributions is that you'll end up with more documentation.



John E. Davis's creations (slrn, Jed, and the Slang sources) are available
at their MIT home site. The most
recent versions, as well as beta versions, can be found there.



This Mexican site is
the source for the most recent versions of the Midnight Commander, as well as
rxvt.



Beta versions (which seem stable to me) of Michael Elkins' Mutt mail
program are available from this FTP
site. Maybe you can get it to compile with Slang!



Lynx binaries with Slang support can be found at sunsite and its mirrors.



The source for the latest and greatest of the Dosemu releases can be found
at the tsx-11 FTP
site. (Version 0.64.1 was released in November).


  __________________________________________________________________________





If you're like me and work at the console often, you'll find it's nice to
have applications available which work well (and look good!) in an X session
too. I think you will be pleased with the high quality and low memory
usage of the above-listed apps.

                          UPDATES TO MY PAST REVIEWS

      Published in Issue 12 of the Linux Gazette
      


I've been writing these short reviews and other articles for the Gazette
since issue number seven. Even with the short lead time inherent in a
WWW-based publication it seems like new releases and URL changes often happen
right after I submit an article. The status of several of the programs has
changed since I wrote of them, so I thought I'd take this opportunity to list
some of these changes.



By the way, I appreciate all of the email I've received in response to my
articles; feel free to write if you have any comments or criticism.

     * Moxfm hasn't been updated since version 1.00 was released several
       months ago, but it's working well in the current version. I've
       included it here because I've received several e-mail messages
       stating that the URL in the article wasn't working. The current
       URL of the Moxfm home page is http://sugra.desy.de/user/mai/moxfm.
       The source and binaries are in uuencoded form; just let them
       display on the screen of a web-browser, save them to a file, then
       run "uudecode filename.uue".
     * TkDesk has been through several versions since I wrote of it; the
       current one is 1.0b3, released on Sept.25, 1996. There are many
       new features; one which I use often is a file pop-up menu-item
       which hands the file over to a running Xemacs on another desktop.
       There is a similar capability involving HTML files and Netscape
       (or another browser). Check out the TkDesk web-page for the latest
       news.
     * FileRunner has been developing rapidly in the past few months.
       It's current version is 2.1.1, and many refinements have been
       made. It's FTP capabilities have been greatly improved; FTP
       downloads can now run as a background process, and directories can
       be displayed date-ordered. Remote FTP directories can be saved as
       bookmarks (accessible from a menu). Many configuration options
       have been added as well. The built-in shell windows which follow
       you from directory to directory are very handy. They allow you to
       see the output of non-interactive commands (such as compilation)
       and can be dismissed when not needed. There is a FileRunner
       web-page from which the source can be obtained, as well as from
       the Sunsite archive..
     * Elvis has finally made it to a major release; version 2.00 was
       announced recently. It's available from its official site. Elvis
       is remarkable for the small size of the compiled binary,
       considering how powerful an editor it is. Elvis's ability to
       display HTML in a readable form meshes well with the HTML format
       of the extensive help files.
     * Vile has a new official maintainer; Paul Fox has handed over the
       reins to another of the primary Vile developers, Thomas Dickey.
       Version 6.2 was released recently. For some reason Vile doesn't
       seem to be as popular as Vim and Elvis (judging by news-group
       postings). I urge anyone who favors vi-style editors to give it a
       try; it really grows on you. Vile's new official release site is
       ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/vile
     * XaoS in its current release (1.2) has a new feature which
       increases its usability for those running X with more than 256
       colors: it'll run! Previous releases only worked on 8-bit
       displays.
     * Yodl version 1.08 has been released; it's mainly a "small-bug-fix"
       release, i.e. if a previous version does what you want, you
       probably don't need it. It's at sunsite.
     * Procmeter has been updated to version 2.2; changes include a
       choice of solid or bar-type graphing, and refinement of network
       packet transfer display.
     * Xmosaic development has slowed since my review. The powers-that-be
       at the University of Illinois have decided that Xmosaic will be
       the second, rather than the first, GTK (Graphics ToolKit) client
       to be developed.The GTK is a programming toolkit which will take
       the place of Motif in Xmosaic. Scott Powers, Xmosaic's project
       leader, stated in a message to the mailing list that development
       will resume in a couple of months. The up side to this news is
       that the GTK is the "hard part", so that once work resumes on
       Xmosaic development progress should be rapid.

                         THE YARD RESCUE DISK PACKAGE
                                       
    by Larry Ayers

  INTRODUCTION
  


It is a common practice to use the rescue/boot disks supplied with a Linux
distribution if filesystem problems occur and you need to boot from a floppy.
Typically these disks consist of a bootable compressed kernel on disk 1, with
the second disk containing basic maintenance tools such as fsck.



On the few occasions I've had to boot from such disks the transition from
my familiar Linux environment to the bare-essentials, limited boot-disk system
(constrained by the size of a floppy disk) has been disconcerting, to say the
least.  Typically if an editor is available it's a small one with which I've
never worked, and many of the tools I'm used to having around aren't there.



Recently Tom Fawcett has been
refining a suite of customizable Perl scripts which make the creation of
boot-disks from scratch easier.  YARD (for Yet Another Rescue Disk) makes use
of (and requires) the optional Linux kernel compressed ramdisk option, which
allows you to load a compressed disk image into memory at boot-up.  Paul
Gortmaker has written a lucid explanation of the new ramdisk options in the
file "ramdisk.txt", which is in the Documentation subdirectory of recent
kernel source releases.

  INSTALLATION AND USAGE
  


The Yard distribution contains two files which need to be edited as a first
step. Config.pl is a Perl script which sets such preferences as the
type of floppy you're using and whether you are making a single boot-disk or a
double.  The Bootdisk_Contents file contains a list of all of the files
and utilities you would like on your disk(s).  This file needs to be edited
heavily, as it includes much more than will fit on even two disks.  Anything
you like can be included in this file.



The next step is to run the Perl script make_root_fs.  This script
gathers up all of the files you've specified (as well as all libraries upon
which they depend) and constructs a root filesystem upon whichever device was
specified in the Config.pl script.  A ramdisk works well.  The new
filesystem is then compressed with gzip into a single file in your /tmp
directory.  Once this process is complete yet another Perl script,
check_root_fs is run, which makes sure that all needed
libraries,etc. are present.



After all of this preparation you're ready to actually write the rescue
disks; here's where you find out if you've attempted to cram too much into
them. The write_rescue_disk script first copies your compressed kernel
(vmlinuz) onto the disk (the first disk if it's a two-disk set) and then
copies the compressed filesystem image you've constructed onto whatever is
left.  It took me several tries to pare down what I wanted Initially on the
disks to what would actually fit.  The virtue of the Yard system is that all
you need to do to try again is re-edit the Bootdisk_Contents file and
re-make the filesystem. Yard also writes log-files which can be helpful in
diagnosing problems.



Modular kernels are great, but if you boot a kernel image and a capability
you need is a demand-loaded module you're out of luck.  Yard sidesteps this
potential problem by including your modules directory in the compressed
filesystem, as well as making sure that the kernel-daemon /sbin/kerneld is
started at boot-up.



The result of this process is a customized miniature Linux system. It's a
nice feeling to know that if your filesystem is in shambles due to a power
outage or a beta program run amuck that you at least have familiar tools
available.



Once you've managed to edit a set of Yard configuration files which will
successfully write working rescue disks, consider saving copies of these files
in case the disks become corrupted.  I just replaced the supplied files with
my edited copies, then tarred and gzipped the Yard distribution and saved it
to floppy.

  CAVEATS
  


Yard gives you the option of using or not using Lilo to boot your disks. I
first tried Yard with Lilo, as Lilo has always worked well for me.  It
wouldn't work with my Yard disks, so I disabled that option.  I'm using an old
version of Lilo, left over from my original Slackware 3.00 Linux installation,
which may explain this failure.  Yard works fine without it.  Lilo might be
necessary if you need to include parameters in order to boot your system, such
as those required for some SCSI hard disks.

  AVAILABILITY
  


Yard is available from the Yard
home-page, as well as from the sunsite archive and its mirrors.  It's well
worth trying if you want the ultimate in control over just what is included on
your rescue disks.

Unix Expo 1996, October 8-10 in New York

    By Lydia Kinata, lydia@ssc.com
    



  __________________________________________________________________________





This show was actually billed as Unix Expo Plus I^2--a nod to the
increasing interest in all things NT and Internet. In fact, in
1997 the show will no longer be called Unix Expo at all, it
will be billed as IT Forum 97, Internet and Technology Forum.



Despite a preponderance of Internet and NT related vendors and
seminars, (and the ubiquitous presence of Bill Gates), the show
went very well for Linux Journal and SSC. Various
disasters struck, notably the loss of half of our booth display
by UPS, but all in all it was quite successful. With the
exception of Caldera, all of us Linux-types were stuck off
in the corner of the show room, but we were still
swamped by happy Linux and Unix users who had specifically
made the trek in support of their favorite OS. The show in general
had a lower attendance than was expected by show management,
but the Linux contingent were doing quite nicely anyway.



2,500 Linux Journal and 1,600 WEBsmith magazines
were given away. Many people subscribed right there at the show,
many others went away clutching their SSC Unix References or books
with dazed-but-happy expressions. Those of us working the booth
made lots of contacts, and I must say it was a great experience
meeting subscribers and customers who share such enthusiasm
for Unix and Linux. Those NT developers should take note:
Unix users are a dedicated bunch.



New York was a blast, although I had to laugh when the locals
got panicky when a 'Nor-Easter' blew through. I had to say,
"Come on, guys. It's just raining." They should come to Seattle
some time.

On November 11 through 13, Carlie Fairchild and I attended the
DECUS show in Anaheim, California. While DECUS has generally been a
good show for SSC, this show was small and we were the only Linux
vendor attending. The best guess why is with UseLinux coming up in
the same place in January, it was an easy show for people--vendors as
well as Linux-heads--to skip.



There was a series of talks on Linux presented by Jon
"maddog" Hall and myself. Attendance was between 20 and
50, and I think we managed to make some converts.



Carlie had also arranged for to speak to the local Linux user's
group on Wednesday night. About 25 attended (including
"maddog"). I presented a talk called Looking at
Linux. Much of this talk focused on the commercial viability of
Linux, which was an issue many of the group's members had been
attempting to address on their own. In the talk I stressed four
criteria for commercial viability:
     * reliability,
     * interoperability,
     * support
     * and capabilities.
   The talk was well received and the meeting turned into a informal
   discussion of Linux in general. I look forward to talking with these
   people again during the UseLinux show.

                          OPEN SYSTEMS WORLD/FEDUNIX
                                       
    by Gary Moore, ljeditor@ssc.com
    



  __________________________________________________________________________





The first week of November, I went to Washington, D.C. to attend Open
Systems World/FedUNIX. While several dedicated Linux fans came by the
booth, most of the people I talked to knew very little about Linux. Some
were just cruising the booths, collecting whatever anyone was giving away,
but we don't mind--the literature they picked up may spark some real
interest later on. (One show attendee, in addition to taking a few of
whatever we had also took the neat twirly thing we'd acquired from another
exhibitor's booth.)



Linux vendors in attendance were Yggdrasil Computing, InfoMagic,
and Red Hat Software, giving me a chance to meet Adam Richter of
Yggdrasil, Bob Young and Lisa Sullivan of Red Hat, and Henry Pierce
and Greg Deeds of InfoMagic.



Adding credence to Linux's worth in the minds of those with no free
software experience was Digital Equipment's display of a DEC Alpha
running Linux and Maddog's enthusiasm for the operating system. (By
the time I got over to actually see the machine, someone was
demonstrating Quake on it. I sat down and showed him a couple things I
remembered from playing Doom--it was kind of surreal to be
sitting amidst all the professional frumpery of the show while
virtually running around swinging a very large and lethal axe.)



Jeff Leyland of Wolfram Research, the makers of Mathematica, spoke
about Wolfram switching to Linux as their development platform. There
were other speakers I should have made time to hear, but I got caught up
talking to people coming by our booth and asking about Linux. I know
that after a few talks, the Linux booths would get flooded with people
excited to check it out.



I also heard Ernst & Young--well known for their accounting
services among other things--apparently use Red Hat Linux
in-house and asked IBM, with whom they contract for computer services,
to support their Linux machines. (If you're from Ernst & Young,
please send me some mail. We'd like to hear about how you're
using Linux.)



Adam Richter predicted a new version of Yggdrasil's Plug-and-Play
Linux in the first quarter of 1997. At OSW they had pressings of their
new 8-CD Internet Archives set, which includes several distributions,
including a couple I hadn't heard of before.



I would've felt cutoff from the world (yes, even in D.C. on
election night) if it hadn't been for David Lescher, who set me up
with some dial-in PPP access for my laptop, and David Niemi, who made
some necessary tweaks to my chat script. I'm also grateful to Mark
Komarinski, who put together a Linux talk on very short notice when I
found I was dangerously close to having no time whatsoever to prepare
one myself.



The Santa Cruz Operation was there giving away copies of their Free
SCO OpenServer. Someone who'd just acquired one of those gems asked me
why she'd be interested in Linux if she had OpenServer; I noted its
limitations and handed her a copy of Linux Journal, hoping to plant a
seed. Some attendees were being less subtle, affixing prominently to
their big blue IBM literature boxes the Linux bumper stickers we were
giving away.

                 SETTING UP THE APACHE WEB SERVER UNDER LINUX
                                       
    by Andy Kahn, kahn@cs.ucla.edu 
    
    
      ______________________________________________________________________
    
    
    
    This article is basically a summary of my experiences of setting up a web
    server under Linux. I will start with where/how to obtain Apache, then move
    on to installation, configuration, and finally how to get things running.
    This article is written from the point of view of my system, which is a Red
    Hat 4.0 system with v2.0.25 of the kernel. However, a "generic"
    installation or a similar setup should apply as well.

      ______________________________________________________________________
    
  WHERE TO GET APACHE 
  


The obvious place to get the latest version of Apache is off of the
Apache web site: http://www.apache.org.
The source distribution file is apache_1.1.1.tar.gz
while the Linux ELF binaries is apache_1.1-linux-ELF.tar.gz.
Grab what you find is necessary...



If you are running Red Hat Linux 4.0 like I am, during the installation
process you are allowed to select whether or not you want to install a
web server. If you do, Red Hat 4.0 includes the latest Apache and installs
everything automatically with a default configuration. This default configurati
on
even RUNS correctly without any modifications! However, even in
this case, please read my notes and preferences regarding installation
in the next section.



Typically, unless you need to add special modules or features, the binary
distribution or the default Red Hat installation should be fine. However,
let's say you wanted to run Apache as a proxy server. In this case, you
would need the source so you can compile the proxy module as part of the
binary.



(Note: I have heard rumors that the binary included with Red Hat 4.0
has some bugs. I have yet to encounter any myself, so take that rumor with
a big grain of salt.)





  __________________________________________________________________________



  INSTALLATION 
  


I'm not going to cover compiling Apache since it's actually a fairly
painless process and pretty well documented. Given that, let's move on
to actual installation...



Personally, I like to group all the web server files together in a centralized
location. If you are installing this manually, then this is something you
can do from the outset, and I highly suggest doing this since it will reduce
administration headaches.



If you had Apache installed automatically as part of the Red Hat installation
procedure, then things will NOT be centralized! In fact, I thought the
file placement scheme was one of the most confusing I've ever encountered.
Here's what the Red Hat installation does:



web server binaries

/usr/sbin/httpd

/usr/sbin/httpd_monitor



config files

/etc/httpd/conf/*



log files

/etc/httpd/logs/*



web server root

(contains cgi, icons/images, and html files)

/home/httpd/*





I found this to be really disorganized, so I ended up putting mostly
everything under one directory (I left the binaries in /usr/sbin):

    mkdir /httpd
    mv /etc/httpd/conf /etc/httpd/logs /home/httpd/* /httpd
    rmdir /home/httpd




You should end up with:

    /httpd/
          /cgi-bin
          /cgi-src
          /conf
          /html
          /icons
          /logs




And then to preserve the original Redhat file locations:

    ln -s /httpd /home/httpd
    ln -s /httpd/conf /etc/httpd/conf
    ln -s /httpd/logs /etc/httpd/logs




Finally, I added this link since I felt that it made more sense:

    ln -s /httpd/logs /var/log/httpd




If you are installing and compiling Apache manually, you may want to
have the original source files also located under /httpd (or whichever
directory you have).





  __________________________________________________________________________



  CONFIGURATION 
  


Apache has three main configuration files: access.conf,
httpd.conf, and srm.conf. If you are running
Red Hat 4.0, these files will already be set with the correct directory
paths. If you centralized the locations of all these files, but made those
symbolic links as I mentioned above, things will still be fine since the
symbolic links preserves where Red Hat installed everything.



If you are doing a "generic" installation or have some other
setup, then you will need to do the following:



In access.conf, change/update these directory entries:


    <Directory /httpd/html>
    <Directory /httpd/cgi-bin>




In httpd.conf:

    ServerRoot /httpd




In srm.conf:

    DocumentRoot /httpd/html
    Alias /icons/ /httpd/icons/
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /httpd/cgi-bin/




Essentially, these are the necessary directives in the config files that
need to be updated with the new "centralized" organization.



For further configuration options, I will have to give the standard
statement, "Please refer to the docs." :)





  __________________________________________________________________________



  STARTING/RUNNING THE WEB SERVER 
  


To make a long story short, you simply to need to execute the binary
"httpd". Typically, this is done when the system starts up, in
one of the rc files.



In Red Hat 4.0, it has more of a System V'ish startup style. In
/etc/rc.d/init.d
resides httpd.init, which is the script used
to start and stop httpd.
You can also execute this by hand if you find the need.



For other systems (or a manual install), I suggest starting httpd after
most other services have started (i.e.: put it in rc.local).
A simple line such as

    /usr/sbin/httpd &




will suffice.



Obviously, it must start after tcp/ip networking has been started. :)



  __________________________________________________________________________



  WHAT'S NEXT
  



Needless to say, I didn't cover actual configuration options
and how to manage your web server.  The configuration options
I leave to the Apache manual.  Managing the web server itself
depends on what kind of web site you want to run.  My own system
does not run a "real" web site; in other words, I don't advertise
it for anything because it serves no real purpose other than for
my own experimentation.  However, you are more than welcome to
take a look at it since it does have a bunch of Linux related
links to it.  The URL can be found at the end of this article.




Other than that, I would love to hear any comments and/or
criticisms you may have about what I wrote.  Originally, my
plan was to write a monthly article about running/managing a
web server under Linux.  However, short of actually writing a
manual on configuring Apache (which the Apache documentation
is good enough as a reference), I don't know what else to
write about since there may not be all that much to write
about.




However, one idea for a monthly thing that might be good is
to collect hints, tricks, and other useful information related
to running a web server under Linux.  Think of it more as a
"2 cent tips for a linux web server." If anyone is interested
in this, please drop me a note!

Time To Become... The Linux Weekend Mechanic!



     [IMAGE]


    You've made it to the weekend and things have finally slowed down.  You
    crawl outa bed, bag the shave 'n shower 'cause it's Saturday, grab that
    much needed cup of caffeine (your favorite alkaloid), and shuffle down
    the hall to the den.  It's time to fire up the Linux box, break out the
    trusty 'ol Snap-On's, pop the hood, jack 'er up, and do a bit of
    overhauling!

[IMAGE] Welcome to the December Weekend Mechanic!




Well, I'm afraid that the 'ol Weekend Mechanic is going to be a short one this
month.  I've got six classes this fall and have finally reached the point in
the semester where I guess they think we're smart enough to start actually
doing things!  And so, we're all doing things... LOTS of things, as a
matter of fact.  That hallowed barometer of academic industriousness,
Euclid's Little Known "Shave-To-Face" Ratio, is falling
predictably and the No-Doze blood titers are reaching therapeutic levels.
As they say in Tennessee, we're all starting to look like a bunch of rugs...

     
     
     "...walked all over, drug outside, and beat with a stick!"
     



Anyway, we're all surviving.  All of you out there in Academia Land
know what I'm talking about; all of you who've run the gauntlet already and
have achieved "A Real Life" will smile knowingly.  (And will smile
to yourselves, knowing that there is no such thing as "A Real Life")




I've been eating a generous portion of Humble Pie here recently after
last month's Tar Tricks and Find faux pas.  I sincerely apologize for
any mis-information and want to gratefully thank all of you who took the time
to drop a note and provide more accurate information.  I've gotten permission
from a number of writers to include their letters which can be read below.
They add a good deal more light to the subject!




Thanks guys!




Also, I did manage to eke out a bit of "recreational programming"
time and hacked together a prototype tar archive viewer.  This is still
pretty alpha stuff, but it appears to be relatively stable and I've actually
been using it.  Any of you who are interested in Tcl/Tk might enjoy
hacking away at this.  I'll continue to tinker around with this and, by
January or so, just might have a reasonably working version for all of you to
play around with.  If you're interested, have a look at it below.




Anyway, hope you enjoy!

As I mentioned above, I've been eating a good deal of Humble Pie in the past
couple weeks after last month's articles on using tar and find.  Actually,
everyone who wrote was very gracious AND took the time to provide more
accurate information.  I was impressed by the spirit in which this was done:
no one was vindictive, no one was demeaning (although there were a few
"raised eyebrow" type letters :-).




Anyway, I owe a great debt to all of you who took the time to write.  I REALLY
appreciate it.  And to the school teacher from Des Moines, I'm almost
done...

     
     
     I will always RTFM
     I will always RTFM
     I will always RTFM
     I will always RTFM
     I will always RTFM
     I will always RTFM...
     
     



Thanks folks.  Here's the letters...

Hi John,




Just reading Linux gazette for the first time, and stumbled
upon your Weekend Mechanic page.  I'm sure you're going to get more
mail about this, but I read with some astonishment your "More tar
tricks" section.




My Linux box is currently about 1000kms away, but I believe that
the "tar -tvzf file.tar.gz |tr -s ' ' |cut -d ' ' -f8 |less" can be
replaced with "tar tzf file.tar.gz |less".




I liked it though.  If you want a useful pipes example, how about a
"Oops! I untarred in the wrong place and I want to clean up!"
example:


tar tzf file.tar.gz | xargs rm -f 2>/dev/null
tar tzf file.tar.gz | sed 's:[^/]*$::' | sort -ru | xargs rmdir 2>/dev/null





Analysis and improvement is left as an exercise for the reader. 8-)




Enjoy,

Paul.

Just a few nits on a couple of the things in this piece.




tar ...

        Well it sure showed off some neat features of some utilities, but what
you did with that first line can be solved by omitting one character from
the tar options.


        tar -tzf | less  == tar -tvzf |tr -s ' ' |cut -d ' ' -f8 |less





which vs. type ...





which will also give you similar results on aliases and built-ins:


which ls
ls:      aliased to /bin/ls $LS_OPTIONS
which complete
complete: shell built-in command.





This is with tcsh 6.05, YMMV.

(Just a quick note about this:  James is right, 'which' works as he wrote
above if you're using tcsh [because it is a shell built-in??].  Those of you
running BASH and using the 'which' executable will find that the executable
does not return information on aliases, shell functions, and shell built-in's.
I wrote James back after trying this and he concurred.)

Subject: More on locate and update






Saw your note on locate/find in LJ #11.  According to my manual page,
"locate lynx" is equivalent to "locate '*lynx*'", locate does automatic
insertion of leading and trailing '*' if the pattern contains no
metacharacters.  "locate 'lynx*'" will only find files that start with
lynx (i.e. no leading directory or /).




I find the locate command and its associated updatedb command to be very
useful for indexing ftp lists and cdroms.  Most sites and cdroms have a
list of the files in one form or another but they are not easily
searched.  Some are in find format (directory included in file name),
others in ls -lR (directory is separate).  I created updatedb.gen (from
updatedb) to read a file list and build a locate style database,
locate.gen then searches that database.




For example, go to sunsite, /pub/Linux, download 00-find.Linux.gz, then
run


updatedb.gen sunsite 00-find.Linux.gz





which builds /var/spool/locate/locatedb.sunsite.  "locate.gen sunsite
file" does an instant search of sunsite for the file, obviously you have
to fetch a fresh copy of the listing occasionally.




Instead of searching several InfoMagic cdroms for a file, mount the
first one and


updatedb.gen im /cdrom/00-find





"locate.gen im file" then does a very fast search of the entire set of
InfoMagic cdroms and can be done without mounting any cdroms.




updatedb.gen and locate.gen are attached.  updatedb.gen works out which
format the input file is in and selects the field(s) containing the
filename.

(The idea of using 'locate' on a CD collection sounds like a GREAT idea.  I've
not yet had the time to try it, but plan to give this little gem a whirl!)

Subject: How to use "-name" option on find command






In your column, Weekend Mechanic, in the "Linux Gazette" (Oct
1996 issue) on your Web page at:


http://www.ssc.com/lg/issue11/wkndmech.html




You say:




>  The way that it should work is that you give locate a filename pattern

>  which it searches for. Such as:

>

>         locate lynx*

>

>  However, when I tried this on my system, it simply returned nothing.

>  Using locate lynx worked like a charm.

>

>  Got me.





Whenever you use any command with arguments that need to contain wild
card characters, don't forget to quote those wild card characters from the
shell.  I teach this to my students in my introductory UNIX class.
Remember the shell gets first crack at the wild card.  So the
shell will try to match "lynx*" with any file names in your local
directory.




Use the echo command to see what the shell expands your command line to for the
 buggy command:


        echo locate lynx*





This will give you an idea of what the "locate" command is really
searching for.




Any one of the three commands below will prevent the shell
from processing your wild card pattern.


        locate "lynx*"
        locate 'lynx*'
        locate lynx\*





The same is true for your other example with find:


        find / -name "lynx*" -print
        find / -name 'lynx*' -print
        find / -name lynx\* -print





Regards,

John

Subject: why locate didn't work as expected...






Hi John,




Why didn't 'locate lynx*' work for you ?  Well, here's what happens when
you issue that command: first, bash (or any standard shell) attempts to
match the pattern 'lynx*' against names of files present in the
_current_ directory. If it finds any that match, they are _all_
substituted into the command line and passed on as arguments to locate.
This sure isn't what you want...  If (as was apparently the case) none
are found, the pattern is left unexpanded... so why didn't it work?
Well, to quote the man page:

     
     
     If a pattern is a plain string -- it contains no metachar- acters --
     locate displays all file names in the database that contain that
     string anywhere. If a pattern does con- tain metacharacters, locate
     only displays file names that match the pattern exactly. As a
     result, patterns that contain metacharacters should usually begin
     with a `*', and will most often end with one as well. The exceptions
     are patterns that are intended to explicitly match the beginning or
     end of a file name.
     



So, there's your answer! 'Match the pattern exactly' means here that
the fully qualified pathname (starting with a /) must match.
The other lesson here may be summarized with another quote from
the locate(1) man page:

     
     
     Patterns that contain metacharacters should be quoted to protect
     them from expansion by the shell.
     



This applies as well to patterns passed to 'find', i.e.


        $ find /usr/local -name 'lynx*' -print





is the 'politically correct' command line to use.




Merry Linuxing!

Subject: LG issue 11 - find






Hello John,




Glad to see you've not abandoned the Gazette totally. One thing though
on your article about 'find'. I've noticed in the past when using the
find command, it has not found all the files when using wild card
characters such as '*' (as in your example find /usr/local -name lynx*
-print). I discovered from one of the linux newsgroups, that the shell
tries to expand lynx* first, and it is possible that find will not
search all the directories. To stop bash from expanding the filename
enclose it in single quotes, as below:


     find /usr/local -name 'lynx*' -print





Bet you I'm not the first to point his out :)




Regards

Phil

[IMAGE] A Tcl/Tk Tar Viewer




I'm going to apologize at the outset -- it's Saturday and I've still got a
small mountain of work to do for the upcoming week and so I just don't have
the time to write an awful lot about this.  I'll try to summarize the
highlights of what I was attempting to do and what actually worked.




To recap from last month, I'd been trying to find a way to get a simple
listing of all the files in a tar archive.  As was pointed out, this can be
done using:


    tar -tf file.tar
    tar -tzf file.tar.gz


depending on whether the file is a tar or tar+gzip file.  (I'm assuming that
you're using GNU tar, BTW, not all implementations of tar support the '-z'
option which uses 'gzip' to either compress or uncompress an archive.)




The purpose for doing this was to allow you to get a tar listing and then use
this as an argument to tar to print that file to standard output.  For
example, if your tar archive looked like:


xtoolwait-1.0/
xtoolwait-1.0/xtoolwait.c
xtoolwait-1.0/Imakefile
xtoolwait-1.0/COPYING-2.0
xtoolwait-1.0/xtoolplaces.diff
xtoolwait-1.0/CHANGES
xtoolwait-1.0/README
xtoolwait-1.0/xtoolwait.man
xtoolwait-1.0/xtoolwait-1.0.lsm





then using a command like:


    tar -tzOf xtoolwait-1.0.tar.gz xtoolwait-1.0/README |less
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^





would allow you to view the file 'README' by piping it to 'less'.  That was
the reason for needing to get a listing of just the filenames in the archive
-- to be able to invoke tar with the '-O' option so that it would output the
results to standard output.




Now, the thing is that tcl/tk will allow you to capture the output of a file
using 'open'.  Coupled with 'fileevent', this allows you to direct the output
of a command to a text widget for viewing and editing.  So this was the
direction I was going.




I've actually got this working now.  It's definitely NOT a showpiece of tcl/tk
coding:  this 'ol thing wouldn't win any programming contests.  Still, as a
quick prototype (I hacked it out in two days...), it gave me some ideas about
how to put together something a bit more sturdy.  Basically, as it stand right
now, its features include:

     * a directory browser that allows you to select files and navigate
       around your file system easily
     * a tar archive viewer which lists the files contained within the
       archive
     * a File Viewer which can be invoked by double-clicking on a file;
       it allows you to edit, save, and print the file
     * a Save As dialog box which allows you to save (or append) a file
       in the tar archive to disk
     * a small Print Dialog which prompts you to input a file print
       command (defaults to 'lpr') and print the file
   



As I said, it is actually working right now and I've used it several times
over the past couple weeks.




Parenthetically, I've been using Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1 for development.  I
don't know if any of you have tried compiling this from sources.  Using the
supplied makefile, I was unable to get the shared libraries to compile.  It's
been a while since I did this but, if memory serves me correctly, it fails on
some system test and thus refuses to compile the shared libs.  I did find,
however, that by adding '-fPIC' to the CFLAGS, copying the *.o files to a
separate directory, and then using something like:


    gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libtcl.so.0.7 -o libtcl.so.0.7.5 *.o


that I was able to compile a working shared library.  I'd be interested in
hearing from anyone else who's tried to compile tcl or tk from sources.  I'll
quickly admit that I'm still a neophyte when it come to C and UNIX/Linux
programming.  The above works, but if it is "Not The Right Way" then
please drop a note.




That said, let's take the penny tour...




 Directory Browser




To begin, when you start the tarvu program, it displays this directory
browser.  The path is displayed at the top along with the name of the file (if
any) which has been selected.  You navigate to a new directory by either:

     * clicking on the 'Up..' button to go to the parent directory
     * double clicking on a directory within the listbox
     * entering a valid directory name in the 'Path:' entry box
   



If you single click on a file, then its name is displayed after the 'File:'
label.  Single clicking on a directory has no effect.  If you click on a tar
or tar+gzip file, then you can use the 'View/Edit...' button to view a listing
of the contents of the file.  Double clicking on the file has the same effect.




 Tar Listing
Browser




After a tar or tar+gzip file has been selected, the 'Tar Browser' allows you
view the contents of the tar archive.  Now, you can use the full set of
operation buttons to either view/edit, save, or print a specific file within
the tar archive.  Single click on a file within the listing and then click on
any of the operation buttons.  If you double-click on a file, then it defaults
to the file viewer:




 Directory Browser




The viewer allows you to view, edit, save, or print the contents of a file
within the archive.  The name of the file is displayed in the upper left hand
corner.  To either widen or lengthen the edit window, click on 'Widen Window'
or 'Lengthen Window'.  Now, you can manually resize the window, but doing so
does not automatically resize the text widget.  I've not been successful in
figuring out how to do this, although I suspect that it can be done.  Until
then, use the buttons... :-)




If you edit the file and want to save it to disk (NOT back to the archive),
then click on the 'Save As...' button.  This brings up a directory browser
which allows you to save the contents of the editing buffer:




 Directory Browser




This allows you to save or append the contents of the editing buffer to a
file.  The directory browser features work in a fashion similar to what was
previously described.  Because this was a quick hack, I simply coded another
proc to provide the save/append feature for a FILE within the archive.  So, if
you go back to the tar archive list, select a file, and then click on the
'Save...' button, you'll see a directory browser which looks similar to the
one above.




Finally, if you click on the 'Print...' button, a small dialog box is
displayed:




 Directory Browser




You simply input the command to print to your printer and click on the 'Print'
button.




Pretty simple, eh?




As I mentioned before, this is no paragon of programming brilliance.  This was
a rather quick hack, but it does show what can be VERY EASILY done with even
the basic tools of Tcl/Tk.  If anyone is interested in this, you can get the
tcl script here:




  TCL TAR ARCHIVE VIEWER SOURCE
  



For those of you using Netscape, hold down the Shift button and single click
with the left mouse button on this link to save the file to disk.  Call it
whatever you'd like, and then set the permissions to something like:


    % chmod 755 tclvu.tcl





I've got mine symlinked to 'tclvu' to make it easier to remember.




In all honesty, there are LOTS of things that could be done to make this more
useful or efficient.  Just a couple TODO's that come to mind include:

     * Allow viewing of regular files in a directory
     * Allow unarchiving a tar archive to a selected directory
     * Allow archiving of selected files to an archive
     * Add online help
   



The thing is, there are all kinds of fun things that can be done.  This simple
tcl/tk wrapper for tar just lets you view, edit, and print files at the
moment.  The tar manual page can give you further ideas about what could be
done.




For those of you needing a "real" tar utility, I'd strongly suggest
using Miguel de Icaza's GREAT program Midnight Commander.  You
can pick up the sources at any ftp site which mirrors the GNU utilities such
as:

  GA TECH'S FTP SERVER
  



Also, there's a program called xtar which is found at the
ftp.x.org ftp site.  I've honestly not seen this mentioned anywhere and
yet it's a VERY handy little program that allows you to browse and view the
contents of a tar archive.  You'll need the Motif development libraries to
compile this, however.




Well, as I said, this was a pretty quick tour.  Please feel free to hack away
at this and enjoy it.  I tried to comment the code, so you should have some
idea about my mental state when the thing was written.




Hope you enjoy!

[IMAGE] Closing Up Shop...




Well, I'd hoped to include a lot more stuff in this month's WM column, but
time has completely gotten away from me and it's already almost dinner time
(and no homework done yet... :-).  I must admit that I enjoy doing this a LOT
more than Linear Algebra (...sorry Dr. Powell, it's still a GREAT course :-)




So, what are the rest of you guys working on out there...?




I upgraded my home system over this past summer to a Cyrix P-166+ machine with
a Triton II MB, 32 MB EDO RAM, Diamond Stealth Video VRAM graphics card,
Toshiba 8X CDROM, and CTX 1765GME monitor.  I dropped in the old Maxtor 1.6
Gig drive from my previous machine and have just gotten a second Maxtor 2.0
drive (so Linux can finally have its own drive!).  I'll be installing this and
reinstalling much of the system over Christmas Break.  If this sounds like a
brewing "mail brown-out", you're probably right... :-)




I've also gotten pretty enamoured with Tcl/Tk as you might have noticed.  This
is a seriously fun programming environment.  Now, I know that this isn't for
everyone and there are folks who've tried tcl that just frankly didn't like
the language.  Still, there are a growing number of truly impressive add on's
including tclX, BLT, Tix, and [incr tcl] that add a lot of nice
features.  I'd especially commend to the Tix extension.  It provides a
set of meta-widgets such as directory browsers, tabbed windows, and the
like.  It precludes your having to code these types of windows and gives you
a higher level widget to work with.  If you're interested in this, then
definitely run the demo program as it give you a IMPRESSIVE tour of the widget
set.




Finally, I've just gotten a microphone for my sound card (SB Vibra 16 PnP) and
have been messing around with creating sound files.




Pretty cool :-)




I'm still not completely facile with all the basics, but I've gotten a few
snippets recorded, including a "Happy Birthday" rendition (my wife
and me) to our sister-in-law.  It'd curl 'ol Lawrence Welk's toes, I suspect,
but it was fun to send this rascal out via email.  You know... "reach out
and touch someone..."




Well, here's wishing you Happy Linux'ing!




Since I didn't have time this month do to a "Christmas Shopping
List" of Linux goodies, I'll try to get this in next month so that after
you return all those bottles of aftershave and the argyle socks, you'll know
what to do with the money... :-)




From our household to yours,




Wishing you a Merry and Joyous Christmas Season!





John

home-built ones.




    Larry Ayers
    Larry Ayers lives on a small farm
    in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
    timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
    does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
    prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
    struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.
    



    John M. Fisk
    John Fisk is most noteworthy as the former editor of the
Linux Gazette.
After three years as a General Surgery resident and
Research Fellow at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center,
John decided to "hang up the stethoscope", and pursue a
career in Medical Information Management. He's currently a full
time student at the Middle Tennessee State University and hopes
to complete a graduate degree in Computer Science before
entering a Medical Informatics Fellowship. In his dwindling
free time he and his wife Faith enjoy hiking and camping in
Tennessee's beautiful Great Smoky Mountains. He has been an avid Linux fan,
since his first Slackware 2.0.0 installation a year and a half
ago.




    Michael J. Hammel
    Michael J. Hammel,
    is a transient software engineer with a background in
    everything from data communications to GUI development to Interactive Cable
    systems--all based in Unix. His interests outside of computers
    include 5K/10K races, skiing, Thai food and gardening. He suggests if you
    have any serious interest in finding out more about him, you visit his home
    pages at http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel. You'll find out more
    there than you really wanted to know.
    



    Andy Kahn
    Andy Kahn is currently a graduate student in Computer Science at
    UCLA, praying to finish his Masters degree sometime in the foreseeable
    near future.  His primary research area is in parallel I/O.  On
    the side, Andy also does Unix System Administration at Activision,
    a well-known computer games company.  He also has had previous jobs,
    including system administration and programming by masquerading
    as a Software Engineer.  Andy has been an on and off Linux
    enthusiast since his first SLS v1.02 installation over 3 years ago.
    



    Jesper Pedersen
    Jesper Pedersen lives in Odense, Denmark, where he has studied computer
    science
    at Odense University since 1990. He expects to obtain his degree in a year
    and
    a half. He has a great job as a system manager at the
    university, and also teaches computer science two hours a week. He is very
    proud of his "child," The Dotfile Generator, which he wrote as part of his
    job at the university. The idea for it came a year and a half ago, when he
    had
    to learn how to configure Emacs by reading about 700 pages of the lisp
    manual.
    It started small, but as time went by, it expanded into a huge project.
    In his spare time, he does Yiu-Yitsu, listens to music, drinks beer and has
    fun with
    his girl friend. He loves pets, and has a 200 litre aquarium and two very
    cute
    rabbits.

  NOT LINUX 
  



  __________________________________________________________________________








Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.



Major "Not Linux" projects on my plate these days are the repair of a quilt
and Thanksgiving.



The "Sunbonnet Sue" quilt was
made for my sister Gaynell when she about 5, and is turning into more work than
I expected. But when I am finished, it will be beautiful again and
will make a good Christmas present for her.



Thanksgiving feels like an even
bigger project than the quilt repair--I get to host this year, which means
I do the major part of the cooking. I will be serving traditional Southern
fare, since I was raised in Texas. I feel like I should already be cooking
to be ready on time. At any rate, I am looking forward to visiting with
family, and eating too much. :-) I am also looking forward to the long
weekend--four days off from work feels like a vacation!



Have fun!
