<H2>NAME</H2>
       xmkmf - create a Makefile from an Imakefile

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
       <b>xmkmf</b> [ -a ] [ <i>topdir</i> [ <i>curdir</i> ] ]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       The  <i>xmkmf</i>  command is the normal way to create a <i>Makefile</i>
       from an <i>Imakefile</i> shipped with third-party software.

       When invoked with no arguments in a  directory  containing
       an  <i>Imakefile,</i>  the  <i>imake</i>  program  is run with arguments
       appropriate for your system (configured into <i>xmkmf</i> when   X
       was built) and generates a <i>Makefile.</i>

       When invoked with the <i>-a</i> option, <i>xmkmf</i> builds the <i>Makefile</i>
       in the current directory, and then automatically  executes
       ``make  Makefiles''  (in  case  there are subdirectories),
       ``make includes'', and ``make depend'' for you.   This  is
       the normal way to configure software that is outside the X
       Consortium build tree.

       If working inside the X Consortium  build  tree  (unlikely
       unless  you  are an X developer, and even then this option
       is never really used), the <i>topdir</i> argument should be spec-
       ified  as the relative pathname from the current directory
       to the top of the build tree.  Optionally, <i>curdir</i>  may  be
       specified as a relative pathname from the top of the build
       tree to the current directory.  It is necessary to  supply
       <i>curdir</i> if the current directory has subdirectories, or the
       <i>Makefile</i> will not be able to build the subdirectories.  If
       a  <i>topdir</i>  is given, <i>xmkmf</i> assumes nothing is installed on
       your system and looks for files in the build tree  instead
       of using the installed versions.
