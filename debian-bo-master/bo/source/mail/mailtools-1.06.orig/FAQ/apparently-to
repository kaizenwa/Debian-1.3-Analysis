unfortunately all that exists is in the pod's that are within the .pm files.

If they do not contain enough info for you, please feel free to mail
me your `quirks' and I will see what I can do.

The Mailtools dist is currently going under a re-write, well part of
it anyway, and part of that will include better docs -- keep watching.

Apparently there are some, very anoying, SMTP servers that do this. A
colleage here suffers with this problem on his home machine will all mail
that arrives via his IP.

I do not think it is a problem with Mail::Internet or Net::SMTP, nor
do I think it can be avoided. I take it you did have a To: line in
the original Mail::Internet object ?

I am afraid I cannot give any better advice
