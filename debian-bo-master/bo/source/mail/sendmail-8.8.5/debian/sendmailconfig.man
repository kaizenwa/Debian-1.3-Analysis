.TH SENDMAILCONFIG 8 21-Jan-1997
.SH NAME
sendmailconfig \- configure sendmail for Debian systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
sendmailconfig [--no-reload]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sendmailconfig
is used to simplify the configuration of sendmail(8) for use on Debian
systems.
.PP
In the simplest case, you may run this program to (re)configure sendmail for
your Debian system at any time. It will modify the file /etc/mail/sendmail.mc
in order to create a working sendmail configuration which will be written to
the file /etc/mail/sendmail.cf.
.PP
For advanced configurations, you can modify the sendmail.mc file before
generating sendmail.cf. Future invokations of
.B sendmailconfig
will preserve these changes provided they are made at the end of the file.
.PP
Normally
.B sendmailconfig
will ask if you want to reload sendmail after making changes to its
configuration. The --no-reload option will avoid this question.
