# Generic default make file containing settings that relate to the OS or
# to selectable features within the OS. The configuration options for Exim
# itself live in Local/Makefile, which is constructed by editing src/EDITME.

# These settings are basic defaults which may be overridden, either by the
# generic OS-specific files, or by site-specific files. Do not edit this file.
# Instead, edit or create suitable OS-specific and/or site specific files.
# See the manual for details.


# BASENAME_COMMAND contains the path to the "basename" command, which varies
# from OS to OS. This is used when building the Exim monitor script only. (See
# also HOSTNAME_COMMAND.)

BASENAME_COMMAND=/usr/bin/basename


# CC contains the name of the C compiler to be used.

CC=gcc


# CFLAGS contains flags to be passed to the compiler.

CFLAGS=-O


# Some systems require a separate library to be supplied when linking programs
# that make use of DBM library calls. This can be set in DBMLIB, which is left
# unset here, but is set in some of the OS-specific Makefiles.

# The error name for quota exceeded varies among operating systems, and
# even, unfortunately, in different versions of the same operating system.
# EDQUOT was not in Sys V, but is in SPEC 1170, apparently. It was used
# in SunOS4, but got taken out for SunOS5, where ENOSPC was given if a quota
# was exceeded. However, it got put back into SunOS5 with a patch to 5.4 in
# order to comply with SPEC 1170. Thus even different patch levels of the same
# system (SunOS5) may use different numbers.
#
# If you don't have quotas or are not interested in handling quota errors
# specially, just set this variable to 0. If it is not set, it defaults to
# EDQUOT if that is defined for the OS; otherwise it defaults to ENOSPC.

# ERRNO_QUOTA=EDQUOT


# The exiwhat utility script calls the ps command and egreps the output in
# order to find all the processes running Exim. Then it sends each of them a
# SIGUSR1 signal. The arguments for the various commands needed to do this
# vary from OS to OS. These defaults work on Solaris 2, HPUX, and IRIX.
# The OS-specific Makefiles have different versions for other systems, and you
# can override with your own requirements in your private Makefiles in the
# Local directory. The most commonly found alternatives are -ax instead of -e
# for the ps argument, and / instead of a blank before the name exim for the
# egrep argument on systems whose ps output shows the full path name.

EXIWHAT_PS_ARG=-e
EXIWHAT_KILL_ARG=-USR1
EXIWHAT_EGREP_ARG=' exim( |$$)'


# IPv6 is coming. One of these days Exim will have support for it. In
# preparation, there is some configuration structure here to enable people
# who are developing IPv6 stuff to experiment. Do not set this option unless
# you are working on IPv6 and know what you are doing. As well as the basic
# enabling option, there are parameters for include and library directories
# that may be needed for IPv6.

# HAVE_IPV6=YES
# IPV6_INCLUDE=/usr/ipv6/include
# IPV6_LIBS=-L/usr/ipv6/libs -linet6


# Not all operating systems have NIS. Exim does not necessarily make use of
# it - depending on its configuration - but if it is to include the relevant
# code in the binary, HAVE_NIS must be set to YES. This is the default, because
# most OS seem to have it, but some of the OS-specific files turn it off.

HAVE_NIS=YES


# Not all operating systems have NIS+. Exim does not necessarily make use of
# it - depending on its configuration - but if it is to include the relevant
# code in the binary, HAVE_NISPLUS must be set to YES. This is not the default,
# because NIS+ doesn't seem that widespread at present.

# HAVE_NISPLUS=YES


# Not all operating systems have the seteuid() function. Exim does not
# necessarily make use of it - depending on its configuration - but if
# it is to use it at all, HAVE_SETEUID must be set to YES.

HAVE_SETEUID=YES


# Some operating systems (well, one) have the setresuid() function instead
# of the seteuid() function. Setting HAVE_SETRESUID=YES causes the definition
# of a macro to turn calls to seteuid() into calls to setresuid().

# HAVE_SETRESUID=YES


# HOSTNAME_COMMAND contains the path to the "hostname" command, which varies
# from OS to OS. This is used when building the Exim monitor script only. (See
# also BASENAME_COMMAND.)

HOSTNAME_COMMAND=/bin/hostname


# LIBIDENTCFLAGS contains additional flags to be passed to the compiler when
# compiling the libident routines. Most systems are assumed to have ANSI
# headers, so the default is set that way.

LIBIDENTCFLAGS=-DHAVE_ANSIHEADERS


# LIBIDENTNAME contains the name of the target as used by the Makefile for the
# libident routines; "libident.a" works for most systems.

LIBIDENTNAME=libident.a


# Some OS require a separate library to be quoted when linking programs that
# call name resolver functions. This can be set in LIBRESOLV, which is left
# unset here, but is set is some of the OS-specific Makefiles.

# LIBRESOLV=


# RANLIB should be set to something that does nothing on systems that do not
# have the ranlib command or do not need to run it on library files.

RANLIB=ranlib


# By default, Exim uses traditional dbm function calls to handle its indexed
# hints databases. On systems that have Berkeley db installed, this still
# works via the compatibility interface. However, by defining USE_DB you can
# make it use native db functions calls.

# USE_DB=YES

# The following definitions are relevant only when compiling the Exim monitor
# program, which requires an X11 display. See the varible EXIM_MONITOR in
# src/EDITME for how to suppress this compilation.

# X11 contains the location of the X11 libraries and include files.

X11=/usr/X11R5

# XINCLUDE contains options for header inclusion when compiling functions
# that call X11 functions.

XINCLUDE=-I$(X11)/include

# XLFLAGS contains flags to be passed to the linker when linking the monitor.

XLFLAGS=-L$(X11)/lib

# A modified version of the Athena TextPop module is supplied with Exim. The
# modification is to remove the "replace" part of the "search and replace"
# operation because it isn't wanted. TextPop is only one of a number of
# modules that make up the Text widget. Some antique link editors cannot handle
# the case of a replacement module for one of a set of modules. To allow
# the monitor to be linked in such cases, set the value of EXIMON_TEXTPOP
# to be empty. The search operations will then contain a useless "replace"
# option, which is untidy, but does no harm.

EXIMON_TEXTPOP=em_TextPop.o
