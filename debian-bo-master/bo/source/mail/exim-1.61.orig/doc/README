Exim Documentation
------------------

This directory should contain the following files:

  README        this document
  ChangeLog     most recent log of all changes to Exim
  NewStuff      features that haven't made it to the manual yet,
                and/or a list of newly-added functions
  filter.txt    specification of filter file contents
  spec.txt      main specification of Exim
  oview.txt     an overview of Exim

The .txt files are straight ASCII text with change bars on the right for
changes from the previous editions.

PostScript
----------

The Exim specifications are also available in PostScript. This is not included
in the main distribution because not everyone wants it and it doesn't diff
well, causing patches to be very much larger than necessary.

Wherever you got this distribution from should also have carried another file
called exim-postscript-<version>.tar.gz which contains the PostScript
documentation. When de-tarred it creates a directory called
exim-postscript-<version> into which it places the files doc/filter.ps and
doc/spec.ps.

Texinfo & HTML
--------------

A version of the documentation that has been converted to Texinfo format is
also available in the distribution file exim-texinfo-<version>.gz. When
de-tarred it creates a directory called exim-texinfo-<version> into which it
places the files doc/spec.texinfo, doc/filter.texinfo, and doc/oview.texinfo.

The conversion process is automatic (a Perl script) so the result isn't as nice
as hand-maintained Texinfo files would be. However, some information is lost;
for example, Texinfo does not support the use of change bars.

There is cgi-bin perl script called info2www which converts info files to
html on the fly so that the same info files can be read using the "info"
program, or from emacs, or from your favourite browser. This is available from
