What is tm-gnus?
****************

tm-gnus is a MIME extender for GNUS using tm.

Note: tm-gnus is for only GNUS. Please use gnus-mime for Gnus.
      (*Note (gnus-mime_en.info)::)

tm-gnus decodes RFC 1522 MIME encoded-word in summary buffer and article
buffer, and adds a command to preview MIME message using tm-view in
summary mode.

In GNUS 3.15 or later and Gnus, tm-gnus can display MIME preview buffer
instead of article buffer. It is useful for heavy MIME user.

Summary buffer decoding
***********************

tm-gnus decodes MIME encoded-word in summary buffer using tm-view
functions. (*Note (tm-en.info)encoded-word decoding::) However if an
encoded-word has unsupported charset, it is not decoded.

Extension to Summary mode
*************************

[M-t] toggle about MIME processing (*1)

[key{v}] Enter `mime/viewer-mode' to view a message

(*1) If running automatic MIME preview support version (namely for
     GNUS 3.15 or later), it is a toggle about automatic MIME
     preview. Otherwise, it is a toggle about decoding of RFC 1522
     MIME encoded-word.

`mime/viewer-mode' is a major-mode to view and navigate MIME message. In
this mode, you can move in a message or play a content,
interactively. (*Note (tm_en.info)MIME navigation::)

Inline display for MIME message
*******************************

"Automatic MIME preview" feature is available for GNUS 3.15 or later. In
automatic MIME preview mode, when reading an article in summary mode,
tm-gnus displays preview buffer processed by tm-view instead of raw
article buffer. (*Note (tm_en.info)tm-view::)

Therefore if an article is encoded by Quoted-Printable or Base64, a
decoded article is displayed. Or rich text article is automatic
formated. Of course, multipart article is dealt with correctly.

Different from using metamail, speaker does not roar just then read an
article includes audio content, video player does not play just then
read an article includes video content, it does not do anonymous ftp or
send mail when read an article includes external-message. These contents
are played when you do decoding command in preview buffer.

In addition, in XEmacs, images are displayed in preview buffer as same
as text.

However if you use a slow machine, or are just really impatient, you can
stop automatic MIME preview.

 -- Variable: tm-gnus/automatic-mime-preview

     If it is not-nil, tm-mh-e is in automatic MIME preview mode.  It is
     used as initial value of `gnus-show-mime' and flag whether preview
     buffer is used or not.

Composing MIME message
**********************

If using mime-setup (*Note (tm_en.info)Setting::), you can edit MIME
message in mh-letter-mode using tm-edit. (*Note (tm_en.info)tm-edit::)

Note: Default setting of mime-setup avoids automatic inserting
      signature when sending a message. Its reason is described at
      *Note (tm_en.info)mime-setup::.
