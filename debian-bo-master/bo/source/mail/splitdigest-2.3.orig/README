Introduction
------------
Splitdigest undigests a file which may contain one or more digest files
concatenated together. The result is that each of digest files is extracted
into its own file and placed into a form suitable for reading with a mail
user agent (such as "mail" or "elm"). Splitdigest can be easily extended to
handle a variety of digest files simultaneously simply by modifying its
configuration file. No recompilation is required.


What's New in Version 2.3
-------------------------
Splitdigest now does not copy the "Content-Length: " mail header from the
digest when undigesting to a new folder. This is reported to cause confusion
to some mail user agents when reading the undigested file (since the file
has changed in length). The original behaviour of splitdigest can be
restored with a new option "-l" (which will leave the "Content-Length"
header intact).


Installation Instructions
-------------------------
The binaries are compiled for Linux. To install the binaries and the manual
page, simply type
	make install

This will install the pre-compiled binaries in /usr/local/bin, and the
manual page in /usr/man/man1. IMPORTANT: you will need the shared libraries
that come with libc 4.5.26 of Linux to use the binaries.

To compile from the sources, just
	make clean
	make all

and when you are satisfied, install the new binaries and the manual page
with
	make install

You can modify a number of things in the Makefile itself (see below),
including the path of the default configuration file.
For example, to make splitdigest use a default configuration file
/usr/lib/splitdigest.config, you can simply
	make clean
	make DEFCONFIG=/usr/lib/splitdigest.config LIBDIR=/usr/lib all
	make install

The definitions in the Makefile supercedes those in the splitdigest.h file.
And of course, those on the command line takes precedence over all.


Configuration
-------------
The following can be changed/configured from the Makefile

DEFCONFIG	This specifies the default configuration file to use. You
                must specify a full path for this macro. This default file
                can be overridden at the command line with the -C option. If
                you change this value, you should also change the LIBDIR
                macro in order that the Makefile installs the configuration
                file into the correct directory. The default value for this
                macro is /usr/local/lib/splitdigest.config.
MAXCFTABLE	This macro specifies the maximum number of
		splitdigest.config records that splitdigest will be able to
		handle. The default value is 128.
SEPCHAR		Character which separates messages in a digest. Most
		digests use the '-' character.

Other configurable items in the Makefile:

BINDIR		The path to put the binary in. Default: /usr/local/bin.
MANDIR		The path to put the manual in. Default: /usr/man/man1.
LIBDIR		The path to put splitdigest.config in. (See DEFCONFIG above
		as well.) Default: /usr/local/lib.

The following configuration items are obsolete and will most likely be
removed in future versions (if any). They are carry-overs from version 1.XX
of splitdigest which had a different purpose. Please email me if you use any
of them. If I hear nothing from anyone, they will most likely go.

DEFTOCOMPRESS	If this is defined to 1, all digests output by
                splitdigest will be compressed by default by the utility
                defined by the DEFCOMPRESS option. The default is 0. You can
		still get compression by invoking splitdigest with the -c
		option. Changing this macro is disparaged. The manual page
		and usage help screen assumes that the default is not to
		compress (ie it assumes the default).
		But see the section Future Directions below.
DEFCOMPRESS	This defines the compression utility to invoke when the
		option -c is used. You should specify a full path for this
                macro. The compression option "-c" is a relic from the not
                so ancient days of version 1.X when I wrote splitdigest for
                a friend so that he could extract and compress digests from
                a mail folder for archiving purposes. The default is
                /usr/bin/gzip.
		But see the section Future Directions below.
COMPRESSARG	This defines the option(s) to pass the compression utility.
		The default is -9 which means compress as small as possible.
		But see the section Future Directions below.
OLDMETHOD	The new default behaviour for splitdigest is to undigest the
		file while separating out the different digests. If you wish
		splitdigest to retain its former behaviour of merely
		separating the digests, either supply the options "-s" on
		the command line (the preferred method), or if you want the
		old behaviour as the default if no arguments are given, define
		this to 1. Defining this to 1 is disparaged. The manual page
		assumes that the new method is used. If you used splitdigest
		in your scripts, you should supply the "-s" option to
		preserve the old behaviour instead of defining OLDMETHOD.
