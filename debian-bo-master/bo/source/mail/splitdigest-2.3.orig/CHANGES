Major Changes in version 2.3
----------------------------
1. splitdigest now does not copy the "Content-Length:" header from a
digest into the output file since it was reported (by Andreas Koppenhoefer
<koppenas@koppenas.infomatik.uni-stuttgart.de>) that some mail user
agents get confused by the changed length of the undigested folder.
2. Added a new option, -l, which allows splitdigest to revert to the
old behaviour of preserving the "Content-Length:" header (just in case).
3. Updated the documentation for version 2.3. Hopefully everything is
now in sync.


Major Changes in version 2.2
----------------------------
1. Fixed a bug when -o was used together with a digest not specified with a
full pathname. splitdigest would originally lose track of the digest file
and complain that it could not open the digest file. It now builds the full
pathname where needed.
2. Updated documentation for version 2.2.
3. Added the linux-kernel-digest type from vger.rutgers.edu to the
configuration file.
4. Changed my email address in the various documentation.


Major Changes in version 2.1
----------------------------
1. Added option to specify a directory for the undigested files. The
directory is created if it does not exist.
2. Added the following mailing digest formats to splitdigest.config:
	i)	The GCC and KERNEL digests from Linux Activists.
	ii)	Garbo Announce Channel.
3. Minor bug fixes and improvements.


Major Changes in version 2.0
----------------------------
Added undigestion capability and made it the default. Modified the
documentation. Extended the facilities available in the configuration file.


Major Changes in version 1.3.1 (internal version)
-------------------------------------------------
Fixed man page to reflect extended command line options.


Major Changes in version 1.3
----------------------------
(Note: version 1.2 was never released. It was an internal version only.)

Completely rewritten (well, almost) to support easy addition of digest types
as well as output filenames in a configuration file that is read at runtime.
You now need not recompile when you find new digest types that you want
splitdigest to operate on.

Support for more digest types from news-digest.mit.edu.


Major Changes in version 1.1
----------------------------
Added compression capabilities to splitdigest.


Version 1.0
-----------
First version released designed to separate digests from a mail folder.
