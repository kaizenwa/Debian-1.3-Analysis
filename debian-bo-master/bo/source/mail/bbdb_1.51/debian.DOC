                    ----------------------------------------

   BBDB is a rolodex-like database program for GNU Emacs.  BBDB stands
for Insidious Big Brother Database, and is not, repeat, *not* an
obscure reference to the Buck Rogers TV series.

   It provides the following features:

   * Tight integration with mail and news readers, with little or no
     interaction by the user:

        * easy (or automatic) display of the record corresponding to
          the sender of the current message;

        * automatic creation of records based on the contents of the
          current message;

        * automatic addition of data to arbitrary fields of the record
          corresponding to the sender of the current message.

   * Listing all records which match a regular expression;

   * Listing all records which match a regular expression in a
     particular field (`company' or `notes,' for example);
