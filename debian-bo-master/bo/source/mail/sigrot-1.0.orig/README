If you like this program, and use it, PLEASE send me email! 
(cmorrone@udel.edu)  I put more time into this than it should take any 
normal program, so I'd like to hear what you think of it.

If you'd like to be entered in the sigrot mailing list, just tell me so 
in your email.  Don't worry, its a low-volume mailing list, I'll only use 
it to notify you of new version releases and such. (And I don't think new 
versions will be coming out all that often :) )
