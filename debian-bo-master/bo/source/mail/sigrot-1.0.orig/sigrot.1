.SH NAME
sigrot \- .signature file rotator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sigrot [-r | -on | -off] [[-w | -a] 
.IB filename ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sigrot
allows multiple
.I .signature
files to be stored in one "archive" file.  Each time
.B sigrot
is called, it gets the next signature from the "archive" file and copies it
into the
.IR .signature .
.P
The first time you use sigrot, you will need a file containing multiple 
signatures.  Each signature should be seperated by a single blank line. 
Only a linefeed character, and no other white space charaters may be on 
this line. (If you should like to have a blank line appear in a 
signature, you could add a white space character to the line so sigrot 
knows that the following lines are part of the same signature.)
Just type: 
.P
.B sigrot -w 
.I filename
.P
Now type 
.B sigrot
and check the
.I .signature
file to see if
.B sigrot 
successfully copied the first signature from the archive file.
.P 
You may delete 
.I filename 
later, or move it, it is longer needed by sigrot.  Sigrot makes its own 
copy of the file.
.P
You may find it annoying to constantly have to type
.B sigrot
to get the next signature.  You may prefer to have it run automatically 
each time you run your mail program.  To do this you can write a simple 
script file.  For instance, I use
.B pine
to read my mail, so I would make a script called 
.B pine
in my home dir. (Or anywhere in my path before the actual location of the 
.B pine
program.)  Such as:
.P
.RE
.B		#!/bin/sh
.RE
.B		sigrot
.RE
.B		/usr/bin/pine
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-o filename"
Overwrite signature archive with
.IR filename .
.IP "-a filename"
Append
.I filename
to the end of the signature archive.
.IP -r
Restores the previous signature archive.
.IP -off
Turns off the use of the signature archive file. (
.I preffix
and
.I suffix
files, if they exist, will still be written to the 
.I .signature
file.)  Be careful with this command.  I added it at the last moment.  
While it works just fine, if you were to use the -w or -a parameters 
after -off, you will lose the previous signature archive.  So be sure to 
turn the signature archive -on before using -w or -a.
.IP -on
Turns use of the signature archive file back on. (-r parameter would 
perform the same function.)
.SH FILES
.I ~/.sigrot 
.RS
Per user directory conaining all of
.BR sigrot's
files.
.RE
.I ~/.sigrot/sig_archive
.RS
Archive file containing all of the signatures. (Each signature seperated 
by a BLANK line)
.RE
.I ~/.sigrot/next
.RS
File containing an integer, which is the number of the next signature 
to copy from the archive file.
.RE
.I ~/.sigrot/prefix
.RS
Optional file.  The contents of this file will appear at the beginning of 
every 
.I .signature
file that is written.
.RE
.I ~/.sigrot/suffix
.RS
Optional file.  The contents of this file will appear at the end of every
.I .signature
file that is written.
