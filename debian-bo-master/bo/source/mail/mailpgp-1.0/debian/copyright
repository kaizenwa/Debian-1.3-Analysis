 mailpgp  (Perl 5 script)
 -  MailPGP provides a simple, seamless (?) interface to use PGP
    encryption directly from with a UNIX mailer such
    as Elm (maybe Pine, although I've only tested it on Elm.)
 -  To recieve the functionality of automatic encryption in your
    mail program (read: Elm,) change your editor (from 'O'ptions) to
    /path/where/you/put/this/mailpgp
    Bingo. You're all set.
