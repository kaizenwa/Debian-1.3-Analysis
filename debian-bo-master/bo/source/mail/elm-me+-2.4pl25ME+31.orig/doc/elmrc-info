#
#$HDR - magic line to mark comments to put at top of user's elmrc file.
#
# For yes/no settings, ON means yes, OFF means no.
#
# Lines beginning with "#" (like this one!) are comments.
#
# The "###" lines mean that you do not have a value set and the system
# default will be used.  The value shown was the default at the time
# this file was created.  Yes...the default could have changed between
# then and now.
#

shell
# The shell to use for shell escapes
# If not set value from passwd is used

fullname
# The full user name for outbound mail

maildir
# where to save my mail to, default directory is "Mail"

resolve
# emulate the mailx message increment mode (only increment after
# something has been 'done' to a message, either saved or deleted,

weed
# enable the weedout list to be read?

metamail
# This tells path of metamail program
#
# That version (Elm 2.4ME+) does not use Metamail's companion programs 
# (suchs as mmencode) directly, but metamail package supposes that
# companion programs are installed to search path.
#
# Special values:   none		Don't call metamail
#		    metamail		Don't call metamail if environment
#						variable $NOMETAMAIL is defined

noencoding
# This control makes it possible to send raw 8bit or binary data when the MTA
# doesn't support 8BITMIME and the -B8BITMIME option or
# BINARYMIME and the -BBINARYMIME option
#
# Possible values:
#    0 : Always convert 8BIT and BINARY data to QUOTED-PRINTABLE if the MTA
#        doesn't support the -B8BITMIME and -BBINARYMIME options.
#    1 : Allow 8bit without -B8BITMIME, but binary data is encoded
#    2+: Allow binary without -BBINARYMIME and and 8bit without -B8BITMIME
#
# It is STRONGLY recommended that it be left set to 0 unless you know what
# you are doing!!
#
# Elm doesn't yet fully support BINARYMIME: it requires that text lines are
# terminated with \r\n, Unix's \n isn't sufficient!
# That is only partially implemented in this version of Elm.
#
# Quote from RFC 1830 (Experimental Protocol): 
#  SMTP Service Extensions for Transmission of Large and Binary MIME Messages
#
#      It is important to note that when using BINARYMIME, it is
#      especially important to ensure that the MIME message itself is
#      properly formed.  In particular, it is essential that text be
#      canonically encoded with each line properly terminated with <CR>
#      <LF>.  Any transformation of text into non-canonical MIME to
#      observe local storage conventions must be reversed before sending
#      as BINARYMIME.  The usual line-oriented shortcuts will break if
#      used with BINARYMIME.

nohdrencoding
# Don't do MIME part 2 (RFC 1522) encoding for 8-bit headers?
# Because 8-bit data is not allowed in headers, 
# it is STRONGLY recommended that this is left set to OFF

noheader
# when messages are copied into the outbound buffer, don't include headers?
# when replying

noheaderfwd
# when messages are copied into the outbound buffer, don't include headers?
# when forwarding 	
# (Notice that messages are not copiend to outbound buffer when
#  mimeworward = ON)


titles
# display message title when displaying pages of message?

savename
# save messages, incoming and outbound, by login name of sender/recipient?

forcename
# save outbound messages by login name of sender/recipient even if the
# associated folder doesn't already exist?

movepage
# when using the page commands (+ - <NEXT> <PREV>) change the current
# message pointer...?

pointnew
# start up by pointing to the first new message received, if possible?

signature
# ".signature" file to append to outbound messages...

localsignature
# local ".signature" file to append to appropriate messages...

remotesignature
# remote ".signature" file to append to appropriate messages...

sigdashes
# do we want dashes above signatures? (News 2.11 compatibility and convention)

alwayskeep
# should the default be to keep unread messages in the incoming mailbox?

alwaysstore
# should the default be to store read messages to the "received" folder?

alwaysdelete
# should the default be to delete messages we've marked for deletion?

pager
# program to use for displaying messages ('builtin' is recommended)

promptafter
# prompt for a command after the external pager exits?

builtinlines
# This is used to determine if the builtin pager should be used on some
# messages even if you would usually use an external pager program.
# There are two ways of determining whether the builtin pager should be
# used. If you want any message that is shorter than "n" lines to use the
# internal pager, set the parameter to "n".  If you want the builtin
# pager to be used if the message is "m" lines shorter than the number of
# lines on your screen set the parameter to be "-m".  Setting the
# parameter to zero will result in the message always being sent through
# your external pager.

keepempty
# should we keep folders from which all messages are deleted?

keypad
# are we running on an HP terminal and want HOME, PREV, NEXT, etc...?

softkeys
# are we running on an HP terminal and want softkeys available too?
# (this implies "keypad=ON" too)

alternatives

# forwarding mailbox) and don't want to have listed...

forms
# do we want to be able to mail out AT&T Mail Forms?

userlevel
# are we good at it?  0=beginner, 1=intermediate, 2+ = expert!

names
# just show the names when expanding aliases?

arrow
# should we use the "->" rather than the inverse video bar?

menu
# should we display the three-line 'mini' menu?

metoo
# would you like a copy of a message you send to an alias you are on?

ask
# should the message disposition questions be displayed(ON) or
# auto-answered(OFF) with the default answers when we resync or
# change folders?

askcc
# would you like to be asked for Carbon-Copies information each msg?

precedences
# list of delivery precedences allowed, or empty to allow anything
# precedence may be followed by optional ":priority" specification

charset
# name of Character Set used with MIME text/plain Content-type
# US-ASCII is default. Be aware that if you use a national charset
# elm probably needs metamail to display US-ASCII.

displaycharset
# name of Character Set which the display supports. This is independent
# of the above "charset". This is also copied to environment variable 
# MM_CHARSET when metamail is called.

compatcharsets
# list of Character Sets, which are more or less a superset of US-ASCII
# so we know that we can display messages with charset=US-ASCII without
# help of metamail

configoptions
# list of options that can be configured at the "o)ptions" screen

confirmappend
# Should elm always ask the user to confirm before it appends
# messages to any existing file?
# This is used for both folders in the user's mail directory
# and ordinary files.

confirmcreate
# Should elm always ask the user to confirm before it creates
# any new files?
# This is used for both folders in the user's mail directory
# and ordinary files.

confirmfiles
# Should elm ask for confirmation before it appends a message
# to an existing file that is not a folder in the user's Mail
# directory?
# This is used for ordinary files only and does not affect
# folders in the user's mail directory.

confirmfolders
# Should elm ask for confirmation before it creates a new folder
# in the user's Mail directory?
# This is used only for folders in the user's mail directory and
# does not affect ordinary files.

usetite
# would you like to use termcap/terminfo ti/te entries?

readmsginc
# Value by which message count is incremented while reading a new mailbox.
# Setting this value to a number larger than one will speed up the time it
# takes to read a large mailbox when using a slow terminal.

sleepmsg
# time in seconds which Elm will wait after displaying a transient message
# and before erasing it.  Can be 0 or positive integer.

textencoding
# Type of encoding to be put into the MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding header.
# Usual values are 7bit or 8bit.
#
# -- NOT Used in this version of elm (2.4 PL24 ME7) or ELM 2.4ME+ PLxx (25)
# Now elm analyzes mail when sending and does that encoding of quoted-printable
# when necessary.

showpgppreamble
# if this variable is ON, display text before PGP armor.

showto
# if this variable is ON, Elm will show who the message is to rather than
# who it is from in the headers display.

usepgppass
# If ON, Elm will prompt you for your PGP passphrase and use it whenever
# necessary to make it more convenient to hand PGP messages.

keeppassfor
# The number of seconds Elm should remember your passphrase.  -1 means never
# expire it.

askpgpsig
# If ON, Elm will prompt you for a username with which to sign the pgp
# message

pagemultipart
# Should Elm use "pager" to display MIME multipart messages
# with unknown subparts or with unknown subtype?

mimeforward
# This option controls how Elm will forward messages when MIME is defined.
#	ON: Causes Elm to send the message as a MIME attachment of type
#		MESSAGE/RFC822.  Highly recommended when forwarding MIME
#		messages so that the receiver can correctly view the message!
#	OFF: Elm will include the forwarded message in your editor instead
#		of making it an attachment.

quoteforward
# Forwarded messages are quoted like replies, rather than included
# with "Forwarded message" and "End of forwarded message" banners 
# above and below. This don't have effect if "mimeforward" is TRUE.

require-mime-version-for-hdr-encoding
# If set MIME Part 2 (RFC 1522) decoding is only done when MIME-version
# header is present. Default: False

require-mime-version-for-body-encoding
# If set MIME Part 1 (RFC 1521) decoding is only done when MIME-version
# header is present. Default: True
