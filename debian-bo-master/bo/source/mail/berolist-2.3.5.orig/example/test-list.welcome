Subject: welcome aboard

Hello, and welcome to the test-list, the greatest of all mailing lists.
Hasn't it always been your biggest wish to read tons of bright messages like
"test... test... test..." or "this is a test" or even "test, please ignore"?
Then you're just right here!

Again, welcome aboard. If you should ever wish to get off this great list (I
can't possibly understand why), send a message to test-list@localhost, with
"unsubscribe" in the subject.
