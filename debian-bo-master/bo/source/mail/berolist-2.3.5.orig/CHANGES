Bugfix - In previous releases, an e-mail address had to be specified

Bugfix - If sender was set to the listname, wrong addresses in the members
         list caused mail loops.

         systems with lists operated by different people...)
Change - Changed the format of logfiles. Looks better now. :)
New    - If HOST is not defined in the header file, BeroList automatically
         detects the hostname.

         to understand.

Bugfix - Fixed a bug mistaking "reply-to:" for "to:"
New    - Added a way for non-root users to create lists in the documentation

v1.0.4
------
Change - List filenames now have to be lowercase, to make the list program
         case insensitive.
Bugfix - Finally fixed the "signal 13" bug - it occured when the "To:" field
         didn't contain an @ sign.
New    - "make 586" option in Makefile.

v2.0.0
------
New    - Implemented a new way of sending messages, which doesn't require
         an external mailer and is significantly faster, especially for
         large messages.
Change - changed Makefile to generate smaller code. Also made the Makefile
         more portable.
Bugfix - fixed a bug that let users subscribe to newusers=no lists

         and their solutions.

         closed list

v2.1.3
------
Bugfix - Fixed a bug which prevented users from unsubscribing if they had
         changed their realname, or used a different type of addressing.

v2.1.4
------
Bugfix - Fixed a bug that prevented operators from (un)subscribing users if
         they had changed their realname or type of addressing
New    - Added a makefile for the Pentium GCC compiler
         (http://www.goof.com/pcg):  make pcg
Change - Portability and speed improvement:
         Optional workarounds for weird strcasecmp() and strlen()
         implementations. (Prior versions: strcasecmp() workaround compiled
         in, strlen() workaround not available.)
Change - Documentation updates.

v2.2.0
------
New    - Now adds a date- and timestamp to logfiles
New    - Configure script checks wheter you need WEIRD_STRCASECMP and/or
         WEIRD_STRLEN
Bugfix - Fixes a bug that prevented messages Cc'ed to the list or sent to
         "someone@somewhere,list@here" from being processed.
         WARNING: This requires a new way of calling list in your aliases
         or .forward file! Make sure you read the README file, and update
         your /etc/aliases accordingly.
Change - Moved system-related configuration options (WEIRD_STRCASECMP and
         WEIRD_STRLEN) to system.h, so the configuration program doesn't
         need to edit list.h
New    - Since some systems are (still) sending error messages from an
         address different from MAILER-DAEMON@there, it's now possible to
         prevent there users from posting to the list by setting the
         KILLFILE parameter in list.h
Bugfix - Fixed a bug that prevented BeroList from creating a .members file.

v2.2.1
------
