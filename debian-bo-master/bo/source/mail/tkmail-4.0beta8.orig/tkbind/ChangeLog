Sun Apr 21 19:06:53 1996  Paul E. Raines  <raines@unixhub.SLAC.Stanford.EDU>

	* bindxtnd.tcl (tkBindSource): new scheme for supporting bindings
	models. Moved actual bind commands out of text.tcl and entry.tcl 
	into text/{base,emacs}.tcl and entry/{base,emacs}.tcl and new 
	tkBind(model) settings says which model to use

Sun Feb 25 18:17:18 1996  Paul E. Raines  <raines@unixhub.SLAC.Stanford.EDU>

	* text.tcl (tkTextFormatRegion): small improvement to prevent stray
	spaces at beginning of line

Mon Feb 12 10:25:38 1996  Paul E. Raines  <raines@unixhub.SLAC.Stanford.EDU>

	RELEASE of TkMail 4.0 beta 4

	* bindxtnd.tcl: moved sourcing of ~/.tkbindrc to end of file

	* text.tcl (tkTextSetup): give tkText($w,fillWidth) a default large
	value to prevent error on destroy

Sat Feb 10 15:30:37 1996  Paul E. Raines  <raines@unixhub.SLAC.Stanford.EDU>

	RELEASE of TkMail 4.0 beta 3

Thu Feb  8 15:43:08 1996  Paul E. Raines  <raines@unixhub.SLAC.Stanford.EDU>

	* text.tcl: now use <Map> bind to try to get fillCol correctly
	if text not mapped
	(tkTextFormatRegion): preserves two spaces after period or colon
	and get true prefix from second line, not first. This will preserve
	first line indents.
	(tkTextCenterLine): new proc to center line on screen and
	bound to <Control-l>
	(tkTextKillLine): should be more emacs-like at end of buffer

Fri Feb  2 17:19:32 1996  Paul Raines  <raines@pascal.physics.wm.edu>

	RELEASE OF TKMAIL 4.0 beta 2
	
	* text.tcl (tkTextFormatRegion): fixed hang at end of text
	(I hope for good this time)

Sun Jan 21 13:53:28 1996  Paul Raines  <raines@curie.physics.wm.edu>

	RELEASED: v1.0 beta 1

	* entry.tcl (tkEntrySetup): now replace base Tk 'entry' procedure
	with wrap around to make sure tkEntrySetup is called on creation
	(tkEntrySetupPreExist): search for previously existing entries
	and tkEntrySetup them

	* text.tcl (tkTextSetup): now replace base Tk 'text' procedure
	with wrap around to make sure tkTextSetup is called on creation
	(tkTextSetupPreExist): search for previously existing texts
	and tkTextSetup them

Sat Dec  2 16:12:31 1995  Paul Raines  <praines@unixhub.SLAC.Stanford.EDU>

	* dsearch.tcl (tkTextDSearchStart): now recognizes turns of
 	replace options if text widget is not in normal state Toplevel is
 	now descended from . directly. Also did a bit of packing cleanup
	(tkTextDSearchAgain): new routine to repeat last search without
 	having to popup dialog
	
	* text.tcl (tkTextInsertChar): added clean option
	(tkTextReplace): now takes text & tag arguments like a regular
	'text insert' command (as tkTextInsert has for a while)
	(tkTextWordIndex): fixed loop bug at beginning of buffer

Mon Nov 27 16:28:11 1995  Paul E. Raines  <raines@unixhub.SLAC.Stanford.EDU>

	* text.tcl (tkTextDelete): changed tkTextInsert, tkTextDelete, and
	tkTextInsertTagBuffer to not manipulate the insert mark so they
	work more like the real text commands. I use the bindins mark 
	instead. The only marks the text.tcl file should create now is 
	emacs & bindins so hopefully this will not conflict with most apps.
	New tkTextTagAdd and tkTextTagRemove commands to interface just
	like the 'text tag' commands
	(tkTextReTag): rearranged arguments to be more consistant with
	text tag add/remove commands

	tkTextGetTagRange

	during a state key rebinding.

	RELEASED v0.9

	* prompt.tcl (tkBindPromptChar): new prompt procedure for
	single character queries as in (y/n)?

	* text.tcl (tkTextModified): new procedure to query or set
	if text has been modified

	* tkBindTest: added new procedures and bindings for saving
	and loading files so can actually be a useful editor

	* README: hopefully placed proper copyrights in all places so
	that everything is legal

	* bindxtnd.tcl (tkBindSetStateKey): moved BindState tag
	to beginning of bindtags so if an error occurs, the state
	is still canceled.

Sun Nov 12 18:05:31 1995  Paul Raines  <raines@moby.linux.org>

	* text.tcl (tkTextExchangeMark): changed to not produce an error
	if emacs mark does not exist

	non-whitespace prefix (ex: # >> tom: (roger)). Needs to be
	severly road tested.

	* rectangle.tcl: new rectangle package

	* text.tcl (tkTextDestroy): added C-z bindings

Sun Oct 22 07:03:12 1995  Paul E. Raines  <raines@phrixus.SLAC.Stanford.EDU>

	* dsearch.tcl: new package for search/replace in a dialog

	* bindxtnd.tcl (tkBindSetMesg): added ability to change the 
	variable a text/entry writes it messages to

Wed Jul 26 00:18:42 1995  Paul Raines  <raines@moby>

	RELEASED v0.7

	* text.tcl: Many fixes to "bbox" bug that gave errors
	on cursor movement outside viewable region

	* bindxtnd.tcl (tkBindRequire): new setting tkBind(required)
	keeps track of those packages already required so another
	require will not resource the package

Tue Jul 25 21:16:56 1995  Paul Raines  <raines@moby>

	* text.tcl (tkTextEvalSel): not evalutes at global level
	(tkTextGetParaBounds): added news proc to return the
	text indices of the bounds of a paragraph

OLD CHANGELOG:
  v0.1
     6/16/95	Initial release
  v0.2
     6/17/95    Added check for text widget being disabled
		Made tag list argument optional for tkTextInsert
		  and tkTextReplace
		Fixed bug where mouse insertion didn't get into
		  the undo ring
		Undo must be explicity turned on for each widget
		Added tkText(bindUndo) setting for making all 
		  text widget turn on undo tracking by default
		Added check for emacs mark existance
		Added tkText(bell) setting for those who want silence
		Changed name of distribution to tkTextEnhanced

  v0.3
     6/19/95    Fixed bug with text widget that don't have undo setup

  v0.4
     7/2/95	Removed bindtags command in setup.
		Use temporary bindtags override now to implement
		  "state" keys.
		New tkText(modKeys) variable to inform text.tcl of
		  which keys are modifier keys
		New tkText(delSel) variable to control whether a
		  character insertion should delete the selection first
		  and whether a character deletion should delete the
		  selection instead, if it exists
		Always exports top kill-ring text to Tk clipboard
		Added isearch add-on package
		New tkText(noCase) variable to control case sensitivity
		  of isearch
		Added hook possibilities to ~/.tkTextrc
     7/9/95	Fixed undo with tags bug
