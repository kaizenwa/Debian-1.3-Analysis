XMailTool is a grphic BSD style mail reader.  It essentially
provides the user with a point and click way of reading and manipulating
E-mail.  It supports most of the commonly used commands within mail as
well as a number of features that mail can't possibly support.

To this date XMailTool has been ported to the following platforms:

SGI - IRIX 4.0.1
CRAY - Unicos 6.0 and greater
SUN - 4.0.1 and greater (including Solaris)
Macintosh - AUX 2.0.1 and greater
Sequent - DYNIX 2.0v2
HP 9000/{3,4}00 - HPUX 8.05
DECstation 5000/125 - Ultrix 4.2
IBM RS/6000 - AIX
Intergraph - CLIX
IBM-compatable (386/486) - BSDi 1.1

To port XMailTool to an other platform, you shouldn't have to edit
any of the .c or .h files.  Hopefully ALL of the flags needed to port
XMailTool have been provided and are accessable from the Imakefile.
There are descriptions for each porting flag in the Imakefile.
You may have to check the man pages for library routines to determine
if they are supported in a way that XMailTool is expecting.  If you get
loader error messages about undefined externals, chances are you'll
need to change one of the flags in Imakefile.

In addition, there is currently HyperText help provided by connecting
to the following URL:

To build XMailTool using the Imakefile, you should type the following:

prompt>  xmkmf
propmt>  make Makefiles
prompt>  make all

 * * * * * * *  N  O  T  E  * * * * * * * * *
Depending on how picky your compiler is, you may see anywhere from three (3)
to eighty (80) warning messages about incompatible pointer types, prototype
inconsitancies, and several other things.  While I intend to fix these
problems, it isn't at the top of my priority list -- I have a real job too.
If, as a result of the make all command line above, you get an executable
file named xmailtool, you can trust that nothing unexpected happend durring
the build.

To install XMailTool you should type the following:

prompt>  make -k install

Where "prompt>  " is your shell prompt.

 * * * * * * *  N  O  T  E  * * * * * * * * *
Some implementations of mkdir complain if they are asked to make a
directory that exists.  The Imake.tmpl and Imake.rules files are
supposed to compensate for this.  However this isn't always the case.
Therefore, the -k option in the make-install command line is required.

 * * * * * * *  N  O  T  E  * * * * * * * * *
XMailTool depends heavily on its app-defaults file.  So much so that
I've put a flag in the app-defaults file so that if it isn't installed
correctly, XMailTool will print an error message and exit.  You will
not be able to run XMailTool without the app-defaults file that matches
this version of XMailTool.

 * * * * * * *  N  O  T  E  * * * * * * * * *
HP's proprietary X libraries appear to have a bug that causes them to be
incompatable with XMailTool.  If you are intending to use XMailTool on
an HP machine, you will need to compile it with the MIT X libraries
and include files.


Some of XMailTool's primary features are:

Work Reduction -- There are a number of pieces of XMailTool that shorten
the number of things the user needs to do to preform a task.  The
"State" radio buttons at the top of the tool allow the user to
perform a single task on a numer of messages by simply clicking on the
message header.  The visible file name and directory name fields allow
the user to save from one window.  Accelerator keys for most button
presses are available.  A user configurable number of accessed file
names is saved so the user can cycle through the most recently referenced
files.  

Switching EDITORS -- If you specify "none" as your editor, or if you
don't specify an editor using the EDITOR variable, you can switch
between the internal editor and the editor specified by the VISUAL
variable using the tilde-v command.

User configurable -- Most of XMailTools features are controlled by
either resources from the app-defaults file or through variables in
the users .mailrc file.  Users can modify the look-and-feel to some
degree by changeing these resources and variables.

Multi def buttons -- By pressing a modifyer key while in some buttons
the user changes the definition of that button.  In Mail(1) by typing
shift-r (R) you change the meaning of the "r" key.  XMailTool tries
to have the same "look and feel."

Auto Help -- a constanly changing text field that tells the user what
he is about to do as well as the available accelerator keys for that
action.

Mutliple Compose -- the user can be composing as many messages at one
time as he feels comfortable, or the machine will let him.
