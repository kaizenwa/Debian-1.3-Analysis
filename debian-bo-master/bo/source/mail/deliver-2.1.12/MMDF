		       USING DELIVER WITH MMDF


MMDF can be configured to use Deliver in two distinct ways.  The MMDF
administrator can set up an alias for each user.  Or, each user can
create a maildelivery file for herself.


To use the administrator alias approach, log in as `mmdf' and edit the
file `table/alias.user'.  For each user, add a line like

	user	"user|/usr/bin/deliver user"

where `user' is the name of the user to whom mail will be delivered.
Next, while still logged in as `mmdf', run `table/dbmbuild'.  Please
note that Deliver will execute in the user's context.  See the MMDF
administrators guide for more details.


The second possibility is for each user to decide for herself whether
to use Deliver.  Any user may create an MMDF maildelivery file in her
home directory.  This file is named $HOME/.maildelivery.

Each line of a user's maildelivery file describes how to handle some
or all messages addressed to that user.  To use Deliver for personal
mail delivery, a user's maildeliveryfile must include a line like:

	* - | A     /usr/bin/deliver user

The fields are white-space separated.  They tell MMDF to pass all
messages (*) without exception (-) via pipe (|) to the given program,
and to accept delivery (A).  Here again, Deliver will execute in the
user's context.


Note that in both cases, the MMDF modifies the From_ header line to
reflect the name of the user who effected delivery.
