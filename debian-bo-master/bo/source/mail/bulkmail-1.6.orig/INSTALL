To compile bulk_mailer

(1) Edit the Makefile and change the configuration parameters
as needed:

a. If your system has strdup() (it probably does), change the line 
that reads

	HASSTRDUP = # -DHAS_STRDUP

to read

	HASSTRDUP = -DHAS_STRDUP

b. If your system has strerror() (it probably does), change the line
that reads

	HASSTRERROR = # -DHAS_STRERROR

to read

	HASSTRERROR = -DHAS_STRERROR

c. If your system needs to link in a special library to get the DNS
resolver routines (Suns certainly do), change the line that reads

	LIBS = # -lresolv

to read

	LIBS = -lresolv


(2) type "make"
