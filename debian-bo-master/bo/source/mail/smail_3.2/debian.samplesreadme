These are the sample configurations distributed with the standard
Smail distribution.  The compiled-in configuration can be found in the
`generic' subdirectory.  The AUX-support and arcnet directories from
the source distribution's `samples' directory are not included here as
they almost certainly won't be useful to Linux users.

Full details of how to configure Smail can be found in smail(5).
