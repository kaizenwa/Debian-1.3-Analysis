Things to do before the next release:

- do something to make aliasfile parsing identical across lookup protos.

- investigate: ORIG-ID:<199604230758.AA13625@post.tandem.com\POS,$ZNET^U5>

- trundle through the smail-3-maintainers looking for missed patches....

- include send-pr code as smailbug (in bindir or libexecdir?)

- log SMTP VRFY's, EXPN's, and maybe even VERB's

- make the startup log message more verbose (version, build, build date,
release date, etc.)

- fix bug causing core dump if no owner-$user for lists/user.

- fix bug where qualify_domain() isn't called for addresses specified on
the command line (i.e. it only seems to be called when '-t' is used)

- add IsValid*() checking ala:
<ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.04.corrupt_info_from_servers>

- verify that it is indeed legal for a SMTP connection timeout error to
still result in forwarding what appears to be a complete message....

- fix directors "domains" handling v.s hash table

- look into crash with empty input file

- fix "from_field" to never allow "From:" to go missing and if it's nil....

- fix db lookup parser to allow '#' in left-hand side (if quoted?) [aliasfile]

- do something about the premature lower-casing of user names.  Users
with upper case characters may not be able to receive mail (or at least
read the stuff they've received....)  [this might be the same region of
code that's causing problems for "domains" handling in directors]
(perhaps also add a meta policy flag "allow-mixed-case-users")
[done?]

- fix aliasfile parser to allow case sensitive aliases (ala above?)

- test with sdbm

- HAVE_SETGROUPS on FreeBSD > 1.1.1.5 panics with NFS accesses (Jim Mercer)

- TEST_BASE causes it to still nuke OTHER_SMAILNAMES (jim Mercer)

- use ftruncate() to remove partially written messages in appendfile.c
if ERR_135

- a zero-byte retry file seems to be un-lockable....

- turn down the verbose logging of failed locks, if known other smail
process holds lock....  eg:

	02/28/96 12:07:36: open_spool: /local/var/spool/smail/input/0trpIB-00076nC: lock failed: Permission denied

- write a minimal mailstats replacement (new log file format only)

- implement 'mailq' option to read the "error" queue (mailq -e?)

- implement 'mailq' to follow through on '-t' option (i.e. read header)

- have 'mailq' print "Mail queue is empty' when it is (isatty()?) ala sendmail

- implement '-R'

     -Rstring       Go through the  queue  of  pending  mail  and
                    attempt  to  deliver any message with a reci-
                    pient containing the specified string.   This
                    is useful for clearing out mail directed to a
                    machine which has been down for awhile.

- add necessary hooks to allow smail to run from inetd with stdin/stdout
for the SMTP connection
