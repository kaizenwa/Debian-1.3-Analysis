# 16bit - architecture description for a standard 16-bit machine
#
# Smail has not been tested on any 16-bit architectures.  I do not
# know if the smail text segment can be made to fit in 64k, though it
# should not be difficult to fit the data for smail into an additional
# 64k segment.  Thus, split-I/D architectures may work.


# SMALL_MEMORY - does this system handle virtual memory efficiently
#
# If your system has a large amount of physical memory, or handles a
# moderate amount of VM space in a reasonable manner, do not define
# SMALL_MEMORY.  Otherwise set it to "yes".  This should always be
# defined for 8086 or 80286 where arrays larger than 64K cannot be
# managed efficiently.

SMALL_MEMORY=yes
#SMALL_MEMORY=


# POINTER_TYPE - what integral type has the same size as a pointer
#
# Define this to be either short, int or long, depending upon which
# type is equal to or greater than the size of a pointer on this
# machine.  Given the size of smail, it is unlikely that it will run
# on any machine where a pointer has the same size as a short with a
# short having the standard size of 16 bits.

POINTER_TYPE=long


# BITS_PER_CHAR - how many bits are there in a char
#
# If smail runs on any machine where BITS_PER_CHAR does not equal 8,
# let us know.

BITS_PER_CHAR=8


# BYTES_PER_ALIGN - what byte-resolution should be used for alignment
#
# Typically BYTES_PER_ALIGN is equal to the width of the path to
# memory for a machine, as this is the smallest alignment for which
# there does not exist a performance penalty in accessing an object of
# any size.

BYTES_PER_ALIGN=2


# ALIGNED_TYPE - what type can be put at the start of a block of
#		memory without upsetting the alignment
#
# xmalloc puts a signature at the start of a block of memory to
# show that it is in use.  The sig will be of this type to
# ensure that the alignment constraints work out OK.
#

ALIGNED_TYPE=int


# USE_ASCII - does this machine use the ASCII character set
#
# Set this variable to "yes" if the ASCII character set is used on this
# machine.  Otherwise do not define this.

USE_ASCII=yes
