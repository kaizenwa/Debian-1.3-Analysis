# This file lists the drivers used in a UNIX environment with
# BSD networking and the Berkeley Internet Name Domain server.

# to add a new driver, make a source file in the transports/, routers/, or
# directors/ directory, whichever is appropriate, using the template
# from that directory.  Then, add the name of the driver in this file
# as a line of the form:
#
#	director  name	[flags]
# or	router	  name	[flags]
# or	transport name	[flags]
#
# the following flags can follow name:
#
#	nocache		- signify that there is no routine to cache
#			  resources
#	nofinish	- signify that there is no routine to free
#			  resources
#	nobuilder	- signify that there is no routine to read entries
#			  from the section configuration file
#	nodumper	- signify that there is no routine to dump the current
#			  driver dependant config out to a file.
#	source=name	- specify the file containing the driver's source
#			  non-absolute names are relative to the appropriate
#			  source directory.  By default this is the
#			  name of the driver, with an extention of .c.
#	header=name	- specify the header file which contains the
#			  current version number.  By default this is
#			  the source file with an extension of .h rather
#			  than .c.
#
# ordering is not important, though it can make this file easier to read
#
# non-driver library routines for a particular driver library can be
# included using lines of the form:
#
#	director library  sourcefile...
# or	router library	  sourcefile...
# or	transport library sourcefile...
#
# where sourcefile can be a .c or .h file, whose source is in the
# appropriate driver source directory.  The objects are loaded into the
# library in the order specified, making the order important if library
# routines refer to each other.  Library source files are useful for
# creating common code that can be used by multiple drivers.
