This is the Smail Installation/Administration manual.  It is written
using the troff -ms macros.  Some System V sites do not have this
macro package, though many do.  It is unfortunate that there are no
reasonable macro packages for writing major documentation (other than
man pages) that exist accross all UN*X implementations.
