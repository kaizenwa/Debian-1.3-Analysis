.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I getmap
command reads the file
.I batch
to obtain a list of article files formatted in the style of USENET
.BR comp.mail.maps .
It then uses
.I unsharmap
to extract maps from these articles into the directory
.I mapdir.
These maps are intended to be used as input data to
.IR pathalias (X_MAN8_EXT_X).
The program
.IR uuwho (X_MAN1_EXT_X)
prints individual map entries from the extracted map files.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are recognized by
.IR getmap :
.TP
\fB\-m\fP \fImapdir\fP
Extracted map files will be placed in the directory \fImapdir\fP,
rather than the default directory
.IR "X_UNSHAR_MAP_DIR_X" .
.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIworkdir\fP
The directory \fIworkdir\fP will be used for working storage for
.I getmap .
The log and error log files
.IR getmap.log
and
.IR getmap.err
will also be placed in this directory.
.TP
\fB\-b\fP \fIbatch\fP
Use
.IR batch ,
rather than
.IR "X_UNSHAR_MAP_DIR_X/work/batch" ,
as the name of the file containing the list of new mail message files.
A
.I batch
file of
.B \-
implies that the list of articles is to be read from standard input.
If
.I batch
is not
.B \-
then
.I batch.work
is used as both the lock file and the work file.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP \fIaddress\fP
If
.I getmap
encounters an error, then the contents of the error log file
will be mailed to
.I address
rather than the default address of
.BR Postmaster .
If
.I address
is
.B \-
then the error log is written to standard error rather than
mailed to some user.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP \fInewsgroups\fP
Specifiy the list of allowed newsgroups for articles.  Multiple
newsgroups can be specified, separated by single colons.  The default
list is
``comp.mail.maps.''
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fInewsspooldir\fP
Specify the top-level directory of the news article hierarchy.  Batch
files created by C News contain pathnames that are relative to this
directory.  The default news spool directory is X_NEWS_SPOOL_DIR_X.
.PP
Even though the default values for
.I mapdir ,
.I workdir and
.I batch
are found in the same directory tree, the
options \fB\-m\fP, \fB\-w\fP and \fB\-b\fP
set locations independent of each other.
E.g., \fB\-m\fP does not change
.I workdir .
.PP
The following options are recognized by
.BR unsharmap :
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIdir\fP
Map files are extracted into
.I dir
rather than the current directory.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP \fInewsgroups\fP
Specifiy the list of allowed newsgroups for articles.  Multiple
newsgroups can be specified, separated by single colons.  The default
list is
``comp.mail.maps.''
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fInewsspooldir\fP
Specify the top-level directory of the news article hierarchy.  Batch
files created by C News contain pathnames that are relative to this
directory.  If this option is not specified, the batch file must
contain pathnames that begin with \fB/\fP.  However, if invoked from
\fIgetmap\fP, this defaults to X_NEWS_SPOOL_DIR_X.
.SH GETMAP OPERATION
The
.I batch
file contains a list of article filenames, one per line.
Article files are files formatted
in the style of articles received by the USENET news service
in the newsgroup
.BR comp.mail.maps .
The 
.I getmap
program uses
.I unsharmap
to extact a map file from each artcile named in the
.I batch
file.
All extacted map articles are placed in the directory
.IR mapdir .
A log of each article file is obtained from the standard output of
.I unsharmap
and appended to the file
.IR getmap.log
located in the
.I workdir
directory.
.PP
At invocation,
.I getmap
attemps to move
.I batch
to a file with a
.IR .work
suffix.  (i.e.,
.I batch
is moved to
.I batch.work .)
If
.I batch.work
already exists,
.I getmap
will abort.
In this way, the
.I batch.work
serves as a lock file.
If
.I batch
is
.BR \-
then
article file names are obtained form standard input.
In this case, the
.I batch.work
file is not formed.
.PP
The file
.IR getmap.log
in the directory
.I workdir
contains a history of
.I getmap
processing and errors.
At the start of a given
.I getmap
run, the error log file
.IR getmap.err
in the directory
.I workdir
is cleared.
During
.I getmap
execution, each line written to
the log file is also written to the error log file.
If any error conditions are encountered,
the error log is mailed to
.I address.
If
.I address
is
.BR \-
then the error log is written to standard error.
If no errors are encountered, the
error log is removed, otherwise it
is left behind until a future
.I getmap
run clears it.
.SH UNSHARMAP OPERATION
The
.I unsharmap
program is used by
.I getmap
to extract maps out of article files.
.PP
Article file names are read from standard input,
one file per line.
The map file name is obtained form the article file
and the map contents are written into the
.I dir
directory.
Old map files are overwritten.
.PP
For each map file,
.I unsharmap
writes the following information to standard output:
.PP
.RS
.nf
name of the article file
name of the extracted map file
Subject line
Message-ID line
article Date
Approved line
.fi
.RE
.PP
Each article file contains a news header, a blank line, and an article
body.  The header, which starts on the first line and continues until
a blank line is encountered, which separates the header from the body.
The header is expected to contain at least the following header fields:
.RS
.nf
Newsgroups: comp.mail.maps
Subject: UUCP ...
Message-ID: ...
Date: ...
Approved: ...
.fi
.RE
For any line above, containing `...', the `...' string can match any
sequence of characters within a field, where other characters in the
field must match exactly, independently of case.
.PP
The body for each article file is expected to begin with zero or more
lines beginning with the character `:', followed by the two lines:
.PP
.RS
.nf
echo shar: extracting \fImap-name\fP
cat << 'SHAR_EOF' > \fImap-name\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
where
.I map-name
is the map to be extracted.  What follows are the file contents to be
placed in the map file, followed by the three lines:
.PP
.RS
.nf
SHAR_EOF
:    End of shell archive
exit 0
.fi
.RE
.SH "INTERFACING GETMAP WITH NETNEWS"
To interface
.I getmap
with the netnews software, version 2.10 or 2.11, add a line to your
.I sys
file (see
.IR news (5))
containing:
.PP
.RS
.nf
maps:comp.mailmaps,world:F:\fIbatch\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
where
.I batch
is the full pathname to
.IR getmap 's
.I batch
file.
Normally
.I batch
is
.IR X_UNSHAR_MAP_DIR_X/work/batch .
.PP
The
.I getmap
program should be run on a periodic basis under a user and group ID
that can write to the map directory.
See
.IR smailcron (X_MAN8_EXT_X)
for details.
.SH FILES
.TP 1.5i
.I "X_NEWS_SPOOL_DIR_X"
The default top-level directory used for obtaining news articles.
.TP 1.5i
.I "X_UNSHAR_MAP_DIR_X"

.BR comp.mail.maps
begin with either ``u.'' or ``d.'' and have a name indicating which
region of the world they represent.
.TP 1.5i
.I "X_UNSHAR_MAP_DIR_X/work/batch"
The default work file used containing artcile filenames.
.TP 1.5i
.I "X_UNSHAR_MAP_DIR_X/work/batch.work"
The default work file copy created while processing the input
pathnames.
This file also serves as a lock file for similar
.I getmap
executions.
.TP 1.5i
.I "X_UNSHAR_MAP_DIR_X/work/getmap.log"
The default history log of
.I getmap
activity and errors.
.TP 1.5i
.I "X_UNSHAR_MAP_DIR_X/work/getmap.err"
The default error log of the previous
.I getmap
execution.
This is mailed to
.BR Postmaster
if an error occured, otherwise
it is removed.
.TP 1.5i
.I "X_UTIL_BIN_DIR_X/unsharmap"
The program that does the real work of extracting map files from
netnews articles.
.TP 1.5i
.I "X_SMAIL_NAME_X"
The program used in mailing the
.IR getmap.err
error log.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH BUGS
The format of USENET articles is subject to change at the whim of
a few USENET map people.
.PP
some articles may not be processed.
Most netnews software does an open, write and close for each
filename written to the
.I batch
file.
In rare cases, the
.I batch
file may be left opened when
.I getmap
moved it to
.IR batch.work .
In this case, the last article may be ignored.
