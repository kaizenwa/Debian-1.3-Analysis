.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mkdbm
takes lines as input and writes them to a set of files in the format
produced by the
.IR dbm (3X)
function library.  The key is formed from the characters up to, but
not including, a colon (``:'') or white space character.  The data
after the colon or white space character forms the value associated
with the key.  If
.B \-f
is given, the key is folded to lower case before being stored in the
database.
.PP
If no input files are specified, the standard input is read.  In
addition, if a filename of
.B \-
is given, the standard input is inserted at that point.
.PP
The
.B \-o
option sets the name for the DBM database.  If not specified
explicitly, the name of the database is taken from the first
.I file
argument.  If no
.I file
arguments are given, or the first file argument is
.BR \-
then a database is created in the current directory with the name
.IR dbm .
.PP
The
.I mkdbm
program can be used
to produce DBM files which can then be read by a
.IR smail (X_MAN8_EXT_X)
pathalias router or aliasfile director.
The router or directory should be configured to use the
.I dbm
file access protocol.  See
.IR smail (X_MAN5_EXT_X)
for more information on routers and directors.
For some databases,
.IR mkline (X_MAN8_EXT_X)
should be used to form single line records with comments and extra
white-space removed.
.PP
The generated database contains a single nul byte at the end of each
key and value.  Also a single record containing ``@'' as a key and
value is created for compatibility with the Berkeley
.IR sendmail (X_MAN8_EXT_X)
program's alias files.  The ending nul bytes can be suppressed with
the
.B \-n
option, and the extra ``@'' record can be suppressed with the
.B \-d
option.  Use of
.B \-n
is incompatible with the smail
.B dbm
file access method.
.PP
When creating the database, temporary DBM files are built in the same
directory as the eventual output files.  Then, when it is completed,
any DBM files currently existing under the target name are removed,
.I mkdbm
sleeps between one and two seconds, and then the temporary DBM files
are moved to the target names.  This database creation method is not
compatible with the locking method used by Berkeley
.IR sendmail .
.PP
If the
.B \-v
flags is specified
.I mkdbm
writes statistics to the standard output.
.PP
The
.B \-y
flag is used to create YP-compatible dbm files.  This obviates the
need for keeping sendmail around to recreate the YP alias database.
Calling \fImkdbm\fP with the arguments \fB\-ynd\fP generates dbm files
that are compatible with regular YP databases.  Using just the
argument \fB\-y\fP generates a database that is compatible with the YP
mail.alias database.
.SH EXAMPLE
As an example of the use of
.I mkdbm
consider a file,
.IR paths ,
containing the routing information:
.PP
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'Stargate.COM'u+3n
\&.COM	sun!%s
Stargate.COM	ames!cmcl2!uiucdcs!stargate!%s
ames	ames!%s
\&.ATT.COM	mtune!%s
mtune	mtune!%s
.DT
.fi
.RE
.PP
Given this file, the command
.I "mkdbm -f paths"
will produce a dbm database in the files
.I paths.pag
and
.I paths.dir
containing the above entries, with downcased keys.
For example, one entry will contain the key
.I stargate.com
with an associated value of
.IR ames!cmcl2!uiucdcs!stargate!%s .
