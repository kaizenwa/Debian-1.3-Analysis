.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mkpath
creates
.IR pathalias (X_MAN8_EXT_X)
output given a configuration file that describes the various sources
of input that will be used in generating this output, and how these
sources of input are to be used.  The name of this configuration file
is given as the
.I path_config
argument.
If
.I path_config
is
.BR \- ,
then a specification will be taken from the standard input.
If
.I path_config
is omitted, then the default specification
.I X_LIB_DIR_X/maps/mkpath.conf
is used.  Unless redirected in the configuration file, path data is
written to the standard output.
.PP
.I Dcasehost
converts the hostname in a stream of pathalias data to lower case.
Normally, dcasehost assumes that the hostname is in the first field in
each line, where a field is delimited by whitespace.  If the
.B \-c
option is specified, then the hostname is assumed to be in the second
field.  This is for compatibility with the
.B \-c
option to
.IR pathalias (8).
See the pathalias man page for more information.
.PP
The
.IR dcasehost
command is intended to be used only within the
.I mkpath
command.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
The format of the path configuration file is a set of lines containing
directives.  Blank lines are ignored and the character ``#'' begins a
comment which continues until the end of the line.
The various possible directives are described below.
.PP
In these directive descriptions, an argument of
.I arg
refers to one of the following types of arguments:
.nr pD \w'`\fIshell-command\fP`'u+2n
.TP \n(pDu
\&'\fIliteral\fP'
Literal data specified inline.  (single quotes)
.TP \n(pDu
`\fIshell-command\fP`
Take data from the standard output of this shell command.  (back quotes)
.TP \n(pDu
\fIfilename ...\fP
Take data from the named file or files.  Files may be specified using
shell globbing notation, with
.B "* ?"
and
.BR "[]" .
.PP
The `\fIshell-command\fP` form preserves newlines and whitespace and
is thus not entirely equivalent to usage in
.IR sh (1).
The following lines result in the same input to pathalias:
.pP
.in +.5i
.ta .6i 2i
.nf
map	`cat food`	# ackpft!
map	food	# oop ack!
.fi
.DT
.in -.5i
.pP
For the `\fIshell-command\fP` and '\fIliteral\fP' forms, the filename
used for error messages is
.IR [stdin] .
.TP
\fBmap\fP \fIarg\fP
Specify map data to be given as input to pathalias.  Each file is
preceded by a line containing:
.pP
.in +.5i
file { \fIpathname\fP }
.in -.5i
.pP
where
.I pathname
is the full pathname to the file.  This will cause error messages from
pathalias to refer to the correct file.  Each file is followed by the
line containing:
.pP
.in +.5i
private {}
.in -.5i
.pP
to force the end of scope for any
.B private
directives within the map files.
.TP
\fBsafemap\fP	\fIarg\fP
This is similar to the
.B map
directive, and can be used when you do not have sufficient control
over what the files contain.  If a map file contains the pathalias
directives
.B delete
and
.BR adjust ,
those directives are removed and flagged as errors, before the file is
passed to pathalias.  If a map file contains pathalias
.B file
directives, those directives are simply removed.  No error message is
produced in this case.
.TP
\fBdelete\fP \fIarg\fP
Specify hosts, links or networks which are to be deleted at this
point.  That is, all previous references to any of these items will be
forgotten.
.TP
\fBadjust\fP \fIarg\fP
Specify hosts or networks that add on a surcharge
to any route though them.
By default, this surcharge is 4000.
Costs can also be added to each site as with pathalias.
For example, the following is a valid adjust file:
.pP
.in +.5i
.ta \w'pathsort'u+2n +18n
.nf
walldrug glotz			# default surcharge of 4000 
kgbvax(1000), kremvax(DEAD)	# surcharge of 1000 & DEAD
nsavax(FAST)			# reduces cost, FAST < 0
.fi
.in -.5i
.pP
Be careful when using negative adjust surcharges.
The pathalias program will complain if a cost of a link drops
below zero.
.TP
\fBdead\fP \fIarg\fP
Specify hosts, links or networks which are to be assigned a cost of
DEAD.
.TP
\fBtext\fP \fIarg\fP
Within an execution block, described in a later section, the given
specified text is sent as the standard input to a pathalias command.
Otherwise, it is written to the standard output for the
.I mkpath
command.
.TP
\fBfile\fP \fIfilename\fP
Set the file to be used by pathalias for error
messages, starting on the next line of pathalias input.
The next line will be reported as if it came from
the first line of the file \fIfilename\fP.
The
.B file
command does
.I not
change where pathalias will read next,
only what pathalias calls the line should an error occur.
.TP
\fBcd\fP [ \fIdir\fP ]
By default,
the current directory used by
.I mkpath
begins in the directory of the configuration file, or in the current
directory if the configuration is read from the standard input.  The
.B cd
command without a
.I dir
argument changes to the directory from which
.I mkpath
was invoked.  A
.I dir
arg of
.B \-
changes the directory to the default directory based on the name of
the configuration file.
Otherwise,
.I dir
becomes the current directory for file and shell command references.
.TP
\fBsh\fP \fIcmd\fP
The given shell command is executed.
.TP
\fBpathalias\fP \fIflags\fP
Process the pathalias input directives that have been collected since
the last
.B pathalias
or
.B pathsort
directive and execute the
.IR pathalias (X_MAN8_EXT_X)
command with this input.
The specified
.I flags
are given as arguments to pathalias.  These flags can also contain i/o
redirection, or pipes to other shell commands.  For example, the
following is an acceptable use of the
.B pathalias
directive:
.in +.5i
.pP
pathalias -l hostname | mkdbm -o paths
.in -.5i
.TP
\fBpathsort\fP [ \fIflags\fP ]
This is equivalent to the following directive:
.pP
.in +.5i
pathalias \-i \-D | dcasehost | sort -T X_TMP_DIR_X \fIflags\fP ...
.in -.5i
.pP
An example of a potentially useful
.B pathsort
directive is:
.pP
.in +.5i
pathsort | sed 's/!foo!/!foobar!/'
.in -.5i
A
.B pathsort
directive is assumed to follow the end of a configuration file if an
execution block is not terminated prior to the end of file.
.SH "EXECUTION BLOCKS"
Directives are executed in blocks.
A
.BR map ,
.BR safemap ,
.BR delete ,
.BR adjust ,
.BR dead
or
.BR file
directive starts a block.
Successive directives continue it.
A
.B pathalias
or
.B pathsort
directive ends a block.  The end of a file can end a block, generating
an implicit
.B pathsort
directive.
.PP
Encountering the end of a block normally results in the execution of a
.IR pathalias (X_MAN8_EXT_X)
command.  The exception is when a end of block command is read when
no block was started.  In this case the block is ignored.
.PP
When the start of a block is seen, all directives up to the end of the
block are collected and fed into the resulting
.IR pathalias (X_MAN8_EXT_X)
command.  Directives such as
.BR cd ,
.B sh
or
.B text
within a block only effect that block.  Therefore, a
.B cd
directive within a block will only change the directory for the
remainder of that block, whereas a
.B cd
directive outside of a block has a global effect.
.PP
Additionally a
.B text
or
.B sh
directive will feed its standard output into the block's
pathalias command when it is inside a block, while a
.B text
or
.B sh
directive outside of a block will send its output direct to the standard
output of the
.I mkpath
command.  This later effect allows for the injection of literal
pathalias output into the output stream.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are recognized by
.IR mkpath :
.TP
.B \-v
The internal
.IR sh (1)
commands are executed with a
.B \-v
option, thus echoing the commands that are piped to the shell prior to
their being processed.
.TP
.B \-V
Tell any pathalias commands to produce verbose messages.
.TP
.B \-x
Pass the
.B \-x
flag to invocations of the shell, causing commands which are about to
execute to be echoed.
.TP
.B \-e
Pass the
.B \-e
flag to invocations of the shell, causing shells to exit whenever a
command returns a non-zero exit status.  In addition, the
.I mkpath
program will exit when it encounters a syntax error or unknown
directive.
.TP
.B \-n
Disable the execution of any shell commands that
.I mkpath
generates.  This is useful with the
.B \-v
option and disables the
.BR \-x ,
.B \-e
and
.B \-V
options.
.TP
.BI \-t " trace"
Cause the input to pathalias to be copied into the file
.IR trace .
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
Here is a simple example of a 
.I mkpath
configuration file:
.pP
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'pathsort'u+2n +18n
# world.conf - configure our map setup to build world.map

# get the usenet world maps
cd      /usr/spool/uumaps
safemap [ud].*

# merge in the new maps
cd      /usr/lib/smail/maps
safemap newmap/*.map

# delete our site and merge our private map data
delete  `uuname -l`
map     world.map private.map tweak.map
.fi
.RE
.pP
This configuration file can be used for a UUCP gateway host:
.pP
.RS
.ne 4v
.nf
# Pathalias database for a UUCP gateway

# map information is stored under this directory
cd /usr/lib/smail

# build paths to USENET hosts
map	usenet/[du].*	# grab all published maps, start of block
delete	`uuname \-l`	# delete published references to our site
dead	dead	# links and sites with cost of DEAD
map	ourmap	# add our up-to-date map file
pathsort	> paths.global	# end of block

# build paths for our local domain
map	local.map	# major domain info, start of block
cd	../uts	# cd only affects this block
map	domain.map	# map for uts.amdahl.com domain
adjust	'flaky'	# add 4000 to routes thru \fIflaky\fP
adjust	'flako(HOURLY)'	# add HOURLY to routes thru \fIflako\fP
pathsort	> paths.local	# end of block

# build a sorted forces file, from the source forces file
sh	mkline \-t forces | dcasehost | sort -u +0 -1 > forces.sort

# output paths and clean up
sh	pathmerge forces.sort paths.local paths.global
sh	rm \-f forces.sort paths.local paths.global  # cleanup
.fi

.SH BUGS
The first ``#'' character on a line begins a comment regardless of
whether or not it is within quotes.
.PP
The
.B \-e
option does not stop all execution, only command execution within an
instance of the shell created by
.IR mkpath .
.PP
Continuation lines are not currently allowed in the configuration
file.  Each command must be on a single line.
.PP
For errors reported by pathalias for input that came from the
configuration file itself, the line number reported is likely to be
incorrect, because the pathalias
.I file
cannot be used to set a line number within the file.
.PP
If both
.B \-V
and
.B \-t
are used, the
.B \-V
option must precede
.B \-t .
