What this program will do is simple.  It will take the smail3 logfile
information, and produce a fairly human-readable report.  For example, it
will take the smail3 logfile (/usr/spool/smail/log/logfile on my system)
that looks like:

	12/24/90 00:33:55: [m0innd5-000NXgC] received
	|	     from: root
	|	  program: sendmail
	|	     size: 1263 bytes
	12/24/90 00:33:56: [m0innd5-000NXgC] delivered
	|	       to: jeff
	|	  orig-to: real-jeff
	|	 director: user
	|	transport: local
	12/24/90 01:24:26: [m0io4L3-000NUrC] received
	|	     from: jeff@onion
	|	     host: onion
	|	 protocol: uucp
	|	  program: rmail
	|	  orig-id: <9208070242.AA0012r@onion.UUCP>
	|	     size: 2346 bytes
	12/24/90 01:24:29: [m0io4L3-000NUrC] delivered
	|	      via: uunet
	|	       to: bar.har.edu!foo
	|	  orig-to: <foo@bar.har.edu>
	|	   router: paths
	|	transport: uux

on stdin, and,  on stdout display:

	Processing 4 lines.  (Used 459 bytes.)
	00:33:56: root => jeff
	01:24:29: jeff@onion => uunet!bar.har.edu!foo

I use this as a part of my nightly system checker.  Anyway, it's something
that I originally wrote for sendmail.  I've changed the field definitions
to work with smail3.  Yea, this could be in AWK, but I was in a 'C' kinda
of mood at the time.

This is provided as-is, and you can use it at your own risk.  There's no man
page currently.  One of these days, I might even write one for it.
Until then, "Use the source."  I call it like:

% smaillog < /usr/spool/smail/log/OLD/logfile.0 | mail jeff

Have fun,
