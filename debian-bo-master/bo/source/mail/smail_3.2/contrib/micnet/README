This directory includes the following files:

config.eg - some example config file entries for micnet-only machines
		which direct mail for unknown users and unknown systems
		to a smarter micnet machine which is assumed to know
		these things

routers - this contains a router entry "micnet_neighbors" which will
		look up micnet neighbors via a program called "micname"
		(also in this directory) and delivery via the transport
		"remote"

transport - this contains the entry for the "remote" transport

micname - a shell script which will return a list of micnet neighbors, to be
		used by the "micnet_neighbors" router.  It should be put
		in a directory that will be in smail3's path.
