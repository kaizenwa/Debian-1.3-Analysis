Howdy, Ron.  Here's another goodie for Smail's "pd" directory.

The Xenix mail system is derived indirectly from Berkeley's.  Thus there
is a program like Mail (/usr/bin/mail) and a program like sendmail
(/usr/lib/mail/execmail).

The /usr/bin/mail program can be "persuaded" to use execmail for delivery of
all mail. (This is done by putting a command "set execmail" in the global
mail configuration file /usr/lib/mail/mailrc.)

When I first got Smail 2.5, I wrote a small program, "execm", that replaces
the standard Xenix execmail.  Execm parses execmail options and then runs
Smail.  When Smail 3.1 arrived, I modified execm to use Smail's new options.

Below, find a sharchive for execm:  one Makefile and one C source file.
These files should be all that a Xenix user needs to use Smail with the
standard Xenix mail program.
