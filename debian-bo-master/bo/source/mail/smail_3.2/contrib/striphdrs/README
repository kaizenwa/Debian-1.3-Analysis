Here's how I handle the problem on the smail3-users mailing list.

owner-smail3-users-redist:	postmaster
owner-smail3-users:		postmaster
owner-smail3-users-request:	postmaster
smail3-users-request:		postmaster
smail3-users:	"|/etc/local/smail/stripheaders|/usr/local/bin/smail -odq -oi -fsmail3-users-request smail3-users-redist daryl"
smail3-users-redist:	:include:/etc/local/smail/LISTS/smail3-users


Messages sent to smail3-users gets it's envelope return address changed
to <smail3-users-request> before being sent out to the list. Most mailers
use the envelope from address to send bounce notifications to. Local errors
in processing list messages go to postmaster via the owner-* entries. I
can't recall a bounce message ever getting past this system in two years
of use. It's also the system used by Brian Kantor at UCSD for several
*very* large mailing lists (i.e. I stole the idea from him :-)
