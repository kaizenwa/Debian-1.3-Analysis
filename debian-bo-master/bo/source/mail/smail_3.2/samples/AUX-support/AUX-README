This kit contains replacements and additions that you need to
successfully build and install smail 3.1.27 on A/UX 2.0.1.  Refer to
EDITME for hints at local configuration.  Sorry, but I have not yet
upgraded to A/UX V3.0.

Here is what comes with this kit (installed relative to samples/AUX-support)

AUX-README		This file
conf/EDITME		The build-time configuration for my system.
conf/os/aux2.0		The OS-dependent configuration stuff
guide/admin/Makefile	Modified guide makefile
man/auxman		Scripts for installing manpages on A/UX
man/linkman
man/rmvman
man/man1/Makefile	Modified Makefiles for man pages
man/man5/Makefile
man/man8/Makefile
rbd/config		Sample smail config file
rbd/mkpath.conf		Sample mkpath config file
rbd/procmaps		Handy cron script for building maps with Cnews

================
Pre-Installation:
================

Unsharing the kit causes the files to be placed into the ./samples/AUX-support
directory, where the stuff was put in the first place.

============
Installation:
============

(1) Log in as user root and change to the samples/AUX-support directory.

(2) Edit the ./conf/EDITME file. Your directory layout may differ, but
    I recommend that you use my directory layout.  Now copy the edited 
    file to the live conf directory.

(3) Edit the ./rbd/config file and copy it to LIBDIR (/usr/local/lib/smail).
    NOTE: I set HOSTNAMES and DOMAINS to 'notset' in EDITME. You could
    change them there, but I recommend that you set them in the config
    file. This permits you to experiment and test without recompiling
    everything.

(4) Edit the ./rbd/mkpath.conf file and copy it to LIBDIR/maps

(5) Copy the aux2.0 file into conf/os, replacing any old one that is there.

(6) Copy the Makefiles under ./man/man1 etc. to the live man/ subdirectories,
    and the ???man scripts to the live man/ directory.

(7) Copy the Makefile under ./guide to the live guide/ directory.

(8) Checklist:
       [ ]  Edited EDITME in the real conf/ directory
       [ ]  new aux2.0 file in the live conf/os directory
       [ ]  man and guide Makefiles replaced the old ones
       [ ]  auxman, linkman and rmvman in the live man/ directory?

(9) Build and install. Look at README for information. WARNING, you should
    do a 'make clobber' to get rid of all old stuff, then do a fresh make
    depend, and the make.

(10) Print the Guide: 
	Select a LaserWriter in the Chooser.
	# cd ./guide/admin 
	# make troff

(11) Print the manpages:
	# cd ../../man/man1
	# make psprint
	repeat for man5 and man8
	The resulting manpages will reflect the default configuration
	that I put into EDITME.

If you are using Cnews, the procmaps script will handle unbatching of
received map articles and rebuilding the paths and uuwho databases.
Run it from cron once a day or so. You can run it as user root.

Note that the EDITME definitions are set to build a very vanilla
configuration. All you need is a tiny config file like the sample
provided with this kit.  I also recommend the directory layout that I
supplied. It reflects my experiences in using this package for 9
months.

I set up smail to take the place of sendmail, which is a royal pain to
administer. smail is very powerful and flexible. The inittab entry for
sendmail can be used as is, smail also will run periodically and also
listen on socket 25 for incoming SMTP connections.

WARNING: The mkpath.conf file needs to be modified for your site. Note the
obscure trick for delete...

Man page handling is fixed to handle A/UX preformatted and packed system.
To install man pages, to a make installman. To build PostScript files
for the man pages, or to remove the manpages, you must run make in each
of the man subdirectories ./man/{man1 man5 man8} and say make ps or make
uninstallman, respectively. If you want to print the manpages on the 
LaserWriter selected in the chooser, again you must go to the individual
man? directories and say make psprint.

The guide printing procedure is changed. To print the admin guide on the
Chooser selected LaserWriter, go into the ./guide/admin directory and
say make troff.

I am very happy with smail, you will be too!
