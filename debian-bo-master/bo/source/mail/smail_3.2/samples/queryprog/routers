# This router file defines one router which calls upon a shell script to
# match remote hosts.  To use this router, insert it into a complete
# router file where appropriate and copy the file query.sh into the smail
# configuration file directory.

# use query.sh to match hosts
use_query:
	driver = queryprogram,		# query a program for route info
	transport = uux;		# use this as a default

	cmd = "/bin/sh $smail_lib_dir/query.sh ${lc:host}",
	domain = uucp, read_transport, read_path
