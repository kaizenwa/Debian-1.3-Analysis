# domain.map - information about sites in our local domain.
#
# The domain.map file is used to record information information about the
# connections within our domain.  This map is processed in a separate
# pathalias path run from the global.map file, so connection between
# the local site and its domain must be established.  For the case
# of bargw and the BAR.FOO.COM subdomain, one needs the line:
#
#	bargw	.bar.foo.com(LOCAL)
#
# Then any lines of the form:
#
#	bargw	bar(COST)
#
# will result in the following link from bargw:
#
#	bar	bar!%s
#
# as well as the implied link:
#
#	bar.uts.amdahl.com	bar!%s
#
# Sites in this file are assumed to be also site.DOMAIN, where
# DOMAIN is our local domain unless stated otherwise.
#
# See the file README for details.


# establish our subdomain connection from our host
#
bargw	.bar.foo.com(LOCAL)
bargw = bargw.bar.foo.com

# UUCP machines in the local network
bargw	bar3b2(DIRECT)
bar3b2	bar3b20(DIRECT)

# Other subdomain gateways
curdsgw	.curds.foo.com
wheygw	.whey.foo.com
cccgw	.ccc.foo.com

# Describe connections between the subdomain gateway machines
bargw	curdsgw(DIRECT), cccgw(DIRECT)
