#
# force - force paths over and above all other routers
#
# The force file is used to form the force.path file.  Any matches
# in this file will override all other map information.
#
# It is often much better to adjust routes via maps such as
# global.map or global.tweak than to place an explicit path
# in this file.
#
# Sites in this file are assumed to be also site.uucp unless stated
# otherwise.
#
# Dates indicate when the path was forced or last confirmed

# default gateways to top level domains
#
# If a path to site.foo.edu is known, then we will use that path,
# otherwise the .edu force line below will send it on to a default
# route site that hopefully does know a path.
#
# The d.Top Usenet map file is not optimal for our site.  We
# force this information based on local experience.
