# NOTE:	 Smail handles an alias of the form "user: user@foobar" in
#	 a way that allows such an alias to be used even on the host
#	 "foobar".  Essentially, this becomes a pass-through alias on
#	 that machine, allowing other methods of resolving "user" to
#	 be used.

# redirect mail for usrs to their "home" machines
