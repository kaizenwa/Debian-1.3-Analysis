# private.map - stuff that would go in global.map if it were not private
#
# Published info about this site should be placed in global.map.
# Tweaks on global info should be placed in tweak.map.  Details
# about sites within our local domain should go in domain.map.
# 
# The private.map file holds information thart normally would go into
# global.map, but for some reason it needs to be kept private.
# 
# Note that private connections to sites that do not have published
# maps should ONLY be placed as comments in this file.  Allow
# the uuname.path file to do the routing for them.
#
# Sites in this file are assumed to be also site.uucp unless stated
# otherwise.
#
# See the file README for details.

# we are our own .uucp server
