This directory contains scripts and a transport file entry that can be
used for transmitting mail over arcnet between Fortune 32:16 computer
systems.  This makes use of a /net filesystem which allows the local
host to gain access to the complete tree of a remote host.  By writing
files into a subdirectory of a remote host, mail is transmitted.  This
requires a program to submit mail to the remote host (in send.sh) and
a daemon to pick up mail sent by a remote host (recvd.sh).

The same idea could be used to transmit mail over, say, NFS or other
shared filesystems, though in most cases direct use of SMTP over
TCP/IP is preferable.
