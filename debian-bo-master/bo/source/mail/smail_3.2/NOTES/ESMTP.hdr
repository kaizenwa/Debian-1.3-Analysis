Subject: contrib/FAQs/ESMTP

I would like start the creation of the contrib/FAQs directory.  This
directory would contain helpful answers to the common and not so 
common questions.  I put the following information together when I
first started to play with the ESMTP features of smail.  Therefore,
this file should probably be stored as contrib/FAQs/ESMTP.

What is this?

This is my first attempt at putting together a Smail FAQ.  If you have
any additions/deletions/changes, please email them to diekema@cideas.com.
