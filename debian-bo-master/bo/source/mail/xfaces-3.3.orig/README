What is XFaces?

       XFaces is a program that will display an image for each
    piece of mail in your mail box.  This lets you know at a
    glance who you have mail from.  XFaces starts out (when you
    have no mail) looking like a color xbiff.  As you receive
    mail XFaces becomes a column of mail images.  Some of XFaces
    features:

      - Both mono and color images.

      - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm.

      - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server 
        currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2),
	SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later.

      - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only
        show up once on your display.  This way, if you receive 30 messages
        from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once.

      - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose
        images and sounds or ignore that mail message compleatly. This
	lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a
	mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but
	left in your system mailbox.

      - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This 
        includes the ability to run user command to generate the image
	list.

      - Support for POP mailboxes.

      - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox
	contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priorty
	item needs your attention.

      - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm
        so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can
	be used.

      - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname,
        count, user@host, the contents of any header.

       XFaces is based on the Xt Intrinsics (-lXt) and the Athena
    Widget set (-lXaw).  To build in Xpm support you need the
    xpm library (-lxpm) version 3.2 or later.  To build in the
    sound support you will need NetAudio 1.1 or later. Both the xpm
    and the NetAudio distributions and publicly available with anon
    ftp from ftp.x.org in the contrib directory.  If you want X-Face
    header support you will want James Ashton's compface library
    available from from ftp.clark.net in pub/liebman/compface.tar.Z.

Whats new in this version?

       See the CHANGES file for a descriptions of what has changed
    since the previous version.

What machines will XFaces run on?

       XFaces as been compiled and tested on the following
    machines/OS' (these are all that I have access to):

    	Sun Sparc 10	    SunOS 4.1.3	(MIT X11R5)
	Sun Sparc IPC	    SunOS 4.1.1	(MIT X11R5)

       It has also been reported to run on:

	DEC Alpha 3000      OSF 1.3
	DEC 5000	    Ultrix 4.2a	(X11R5)
	IBM RS/6000	    AIX 3.2.4	(X11R4)
	i486		    System VR4	(X11R4)
	Macintosh IIci	    A/UX 3.0	(X11R5)
	SG Indigos	    IRIX 4.05H
	Bull DPX/2	    68040 based, SV.3.1 POSIX/XPG3
	80386	    	    SCO UNIX 3.2.4 (ODT 2.0 with X11R4)
	hp700/800	    ???
	
       Please help me add to this list.  I am really interested to
    find out how well this works on other machines (SGI?, HP?, DEC?
    IBM?, etc).

Building and Installing XFaces

       If you do not have Imake I have supplied a Makefile.noimake
    that you can tailor to your site. The easiest method is to use
    Imake. You need to look at the Imakefile in this directory to see
    the definitions for USE_XPM, USE_SOUND, USE_BUCKETS , USE_XFACE,
    USE_SHAPE and USE_POP are what you want. By default All of these
    are compiled in.  If you do not want one of them, just comment out
    or delete the #define. Sound support has another option
    USE_BUCKETS.  If this is defined then XFaces will store the sounds
    for all active sounds in the audio server.  If you are using
    NetAudio 1.1 on a sparc then you will either neet to disable the
    BUCKET support or apply the included patch to ausun (the patch is
    in ausun.patch).  The bug in the sun NetAudio server causes a
    weird audio "glitch" that I noticed when playing from buckets.

    USE_XPM   - Requires the xpm library. This is available from
	        ftp.x.org in /contrib/xpm-3.3.tar.gz
    USE_SOUND - Requires the net audio client library and includes.
		NetAudio is available from ftp.x.org in
		/contrib/netaudio/netaudio-1.1.tar.Z
    USE_SHAPE - Requires the MIT SHAPE extension.
    USE_XFACE - Requires the compface library available from
	        cs.indiana.edu in /pub/faces/xfaces/compface.tar.Z
		or ftp.clark.net in /pub/liebman/compface.tar.Z
    USE_POP   - Requires BSD style sockets.

       Next to build the Makefile run:
	    xmkmf

       Then to build XFaces run:
    	    make
    
       To install XFaces type:
	    make install

How to set up XFaces

       I recomend the use of the facedb search to find the majority of
    the images and sounds.  A couple large databases of face images
    are available from cs.indiana.edu in the /pub/faces directory.

       Included in this release are a number of sample icons
    that I use.  Also the sample XFaces app defaults file
    contains examples of using the before bindings to show a
    particular image/sound for items from a mailing list.

       I will be glad to help anyone who is having problems
    setting up XFaces or anyone who has any questions about
    XFaces.

       The man page provides more detailed information than any normal
    human being can stand! :^)  Unfortunatly it is not very well
    written. :^( Does anyone care to take a stab at it?

Sample face images

       I have placed a number if images that we use for 
    XFaces in the images subdirectory.  You will want to copy
    them to your images directory.
