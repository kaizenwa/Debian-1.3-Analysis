Changes in version 3.3:		3/12/1994
   
   Fixed a large memory leak!
   
   Fixed a problem that was caused by elm setting the mod time of the
   mail spool file back.
   
   Fixed a problem with MMDF style mailboxes.
   
Changes in version 3.2:		3/7/1994

   A few bugs were fixed.

   Added a seperate set of annotation specifications for "unknown"
   faces.  As the TODO file notes this feature could stand to be
   generalized a little.

   If the binding field name starts with a '|' then all binding checks
   are case insensitive.

   If the "lookupHostname" resource is True then the host name part of
   the from address will be looked up and translated to the real
   hostname.

   Handle rfc822 routing address in a semi-sane manor.


Changes in version 3.1:		3/7/1994

    A few bug fixes. (one had caused a SEG Fault on many machines)

    User control of the mail annotatons.

    The default values for the imageTypes and imageSearch resources
    should reflect the options that the user compiled in.

Changes in version 3.0:		2/24/1994

       The major changes were to add compatibility support for
    Rich Burridge's "faces" program:

	- Per-face shell commands.
	
	- X-Face: header support.
	
	- facedb image/sound search. (the way faces finds
	  images)
	
	- User list commands.

	- Labling of images.  The user name and the number of messages
	  are displayed.

	- The following faces options are supported:
	      -f <facedbPath>
	      -e <listCommand>
	      -p <update time>
	      -c <# of columns>
	      -h <image height>
	      -w <image width>
	      -s <mail spool file>
	
	- POP mailbox support. (still primitive with respect to
	  user authentication but functional!)

	- A new Tiled widget so that the image list can be N 
	  columns and to allow for the "Rows=nnn Cols=nnn" line 
	  from a user command.

	- Full control of the order and imagetype/paths of searches.
	  The search types are:
	  
		- beforeImage,
		  afterImage,
		  beforeSound,
		  afterSound,
		  beforeCommand,
		  afterCommand:		These are regular expression searches
					on the mail headers.
		- resource:		Lookup image/sound in X resources.
		- facedb:		Lookup image/sound in "faces" style
					database.
		- x-face:		X-Face: style header.
	
	- Searchs are done for images, sounds and shell commands.
	
	- Much improved shape support.


Changes in version 2.3:		1/20/1994

       Compleatly rewrote the mail header parsing.  Now all headers
    are searched.

       Changed slightly the before/after image/sound bining format.
    Now you use three parts instead of to.  The new format is:
	    <header name> <whitespace> <pattern> <:> <image/sound file>

       Fixed a bug in the image code where a pixmap value was
    uninitialized and caused X error on some machines (machines where
    the unitialized value happened to be "None" worked!  others did
    not).

Changes in version 2.2:		1/14/1994

       Added new resource ignoreMessageBindings.  This allows you to
    have some messages ignored.

       Made the "Status:" header one of the headers that is searched
    with the bindings resources.  This allows people who like to keep
    200 to 300 messages in their system mailbox to only see/hear from
    messages that they have not seen yet.

       Made a small change to faces.h to allow for SystemV machines.
    I added macros for bcopy, bzero, index and rindex.

       Improved mail parsing. Before if there was no subject header
     xfaces could be fooled by a line in the body starting with Subject:.
