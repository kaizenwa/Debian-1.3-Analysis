This is a list of things that I would like to see done to xfaces.

This first list is what I consider of a high priority and would like to
see in the next release or two:

- Handle more image formats internally. Currently you can handle other
  image formats via external converters that convert the image to XPM.
  (GIF, FaceSaver, etc) Colormap reduction/dithering.
  We should be able to specify that only N color are to be used.  Then
  when color images are loaded we should convert/dither etc so thay don't
  use more colors.  We should also be able to specify the colormap.

- In version 3.2 I added seperate annotation specs for unknown faces.  This
  should really be turned into a more general facility.

- Use baseTranslations as well as translations so that with R5 and later
  the user can add to the translations.

- Strip trailing white space from facedbPath.
- Search performace.

The following are in no particular order:

- Use the domain name from the curent host when hostname value from a mail item
  or script is empty.

- Resource to raise the xfaces window on new mail.

- Allow the use of MAIL and FACEPATH environment variables for the mail spool
  file and facedb search path.

- Port to other machines (both with and without sound support).

- Have a popup that will show some mail headers associated with a face
  when selected with the pointer.

- Support for DEC AudioFile audio server.

- Invent X-Color-Face headers.(and X-Face-Shape header?)

- Attempt "finger" to retrieve image. (new search type)

- Support some kind of movie for an image. Play a movie (MPEG?) then
  use static image for face.

- Display postscript images and animations.

- NNTP support: show newsgroups + count, show single newsgroup contents

- Document how to add new image types and new search types.
