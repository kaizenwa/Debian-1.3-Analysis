	* Release 3.3

Sat Mar 12 16:03:20 1994  Frank Munkert <ln_fmu@pki-nbg.philips.de>

	* mail_check.c:
	Check the ctime field for changes also as the elm mailer uses
	utime() to set the mod time back to what it was before elm 
	modified it!

Sat Mar 12 15:18:12 1994  Martin Kraemer <Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de>

	* face_image_xpm.c: 
	XFreeColors() causes xfaces to exit with an XLib error on
	SIEMENS-NIXDORF X11R4 monochrome servers. This catches these
	errors and ignores them, handling other errors normally. This
	trick was copied from ghostscript 2.6.1, by
	Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de

Sat Mar 12 14:59:36 1994  Robert Broughton <bob@zadall.com>

	* faces.h:
	I have xfaces 3.1 working on SCO Unix with XFree86. I had to make
	one change: In faces.h, I had to change MAIL_SEP2 to
	"\001\001\001\001\n". [adding the newln - liebman]

Tue Mar  8 10:01:53 1994  Chris Liebman  (liebman@zod)

	* mail_items.c MailItemCreate():
	  If MailItemCreate() determined that this set of headers was
	  already attached to an item the "extra" copy of the headers were
	  never freed!

	* face_sound.c:
	  Fixed a memory bug!  If a full path was specified for a sound file
	  memory would be randonly steped on! (also the sound would not play)

	* face_binding.c:
	* faces.h:
	* xfaces.man:
	  Bindings are case insensitive if the field name specification
	  starts with a |. (eg. "|To:" or "|*")

	* Release 3.1

Sun Mar  6 09:43:32 1994  Chris Liebman  (liebman@zod)

	* main.c:
	  Attempt to create the currect defaults for imageTypes and
	  imageSearch depending upon which options are compiled in.

	* face_search_binding.c:
	  When a binding is matched and there is a label pass on the
	  annotation number to the item.

	* face_binding.c:
	  Added new field to the bindings to specify the annotation number
	  for the label.

	* mail_items.c:
	  Added user selection of annotations for mail using
	  XFaces.mail.annotation<n>: count|user|host|user@host|*<header>

	* face_annotate.c:
	  faceAnnotateWork() was being called with an "Annotation"
	  instead of an "Annotation*"!  This caused crashes on some
	  systems.

	* XFaces.ad: 
	  The resource to specify the image types is imageTypes, not
	  imageFormats as was previously specified.
	  Added defaults for mail annotation.

	* faces.h: 
	  Fixed the prototype for FaceImageColorize().  It was not using
	  the P_ macro and would generate an error with a non ansi
	  compiler. Added new field to the bindings to represent the 
	  annotation # that the label should use.

Sun Feb 20 11:56:59 1994  Chris Liebman  (liebman@zod)

	  independant.

Sat Feb 19 20:48:59 1994  Chris Liebman  (liebman@zod)

	* face_search_resource.c: 
	  Fixed my usage of the class name.  Also grab the name of the
	  top level shell widget and use it as app name. This fixed a
	  problem where you had to specify the images and sounds with the
	  application class (XFaces) name instead of the application name.

	* main.c: 
	  Added back old user@host search type.  This had been replaced
	  in the 3.0 beta distribution by the facedb search.  Now both
	  exist.

	* face_search_uh.c:
	  This file implements the old user@host file search.

	* Imakefile:
	  Added new file face_search_uh.c to implement the older XFaces 
	  user@host based file search.
