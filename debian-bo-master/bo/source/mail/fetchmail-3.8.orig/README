			 fetchmail README

fetchmail is a full-featured, robust, well-documented POP2, POP3, RPOP,
APOP, KPOP, and IMAP batch mail retrieval/forwarding utility intended to be
used over on-demand TCP/IP links (such as SLIP or PPP connections).
It retrieves mail from remote mail servers and forwards it to your
local (client) machine's delivery system, so it can then be be read by
normal mail user agents such as elm(1) or Mail(1).

The fetchmail code was developed under Linux, but has also been
extensively tested under 4.4BSD, Solaris and NEXTSTEP.  It should be
readily portable to other Unix variants (it uses GNU autoconf).  It
has also been ported to QNX; to build under QNX, see the header
comments in the Makefile.

Here are fetchmail's main features.  Those unique to fetchmail
(relative to fetchpop1.9, PopTart-0.9.3, get-mail, gwpop, pimp-1.0,
pop-perl5-1.2, popc, popmail-1.6 and upop) are marked with **.

Since 3.0:

	** Support for ESMTP 8BITMIME and SIZE options.

	** Support for ESMTP ETRN command.

	** The stripcr option to explicitly control carriage-return
	   stripping before mail forwarding.

Since 2.0:

	** Support for secure use with ssh.

	** Mailserver passwords can be parsed out of your .netrc file.

	** When forwarding mail via SMTP, fetchmail respects the 571
           "spam filter" response and discards any mail that triggers it.

	** Transaction and error logging may optionally be done via syslog.

	** (Linux only) Security option to permit fetchmail to poll a host 
	   only when a point-to-point link to a particular IP address is up.

	** RPOP support (restored; had been removed in 1.8).

2.0 and earlier versions:

	**  Support POP2, APOP, RPOP, IMAP2, IMAP2bis, IMAP3, IMAP4, IMAP4rev1.

	** Support for Kerberos user authentication (either MIT or Cygnus).

	** Host is auto-probed for a working server if no protocol is
	   specified for the connection.  Thus you don't need to know
	   what servers are running on your mail host in advance; the
	   verbose option will tell you which one succeeds.

	** Delivery via via SMTP to the client machine's port 25.  This
	   means the retrieved mail automatically goes to the system
	   default MDA as if it were normal sender-initiated SMTP mail.

	** Configurable timeout to detect if server connection is dropped.

	** Support for retrieving and forwarding from multi-drop mailboxes
	   that is guaranteed not to cause mail loops.

	* Support for POP3.

	*  Easy control via command line or free-format run control file.

	*  Daemon mode -- fetchmail can be run in background to poll
	   one or more hosts at a specified interval.

	*  From:, To:, Cc:, and Reply-To: headers are rewritten so that 
	   usernames relative to the fetchmail host become fully-qualified
	   Internet addresses.  This enables replies to work correctly.
	   (Would be unique to fetchmail if I hadn't added it to fetchpop.)

	*  Strict conformance to relevant RFCs and good debugging options.
	   You could use fetchmail to test and debug server implementatations.

	*  Message and header processing are 8-bit clean.

	*  Carefully written, comprehensive and up-to-date man page describing
	   not only modes of operation but also (**) how to diagnose the most
	   common kinds of problems and what to do about deficient servers

	*  Rugged, simple, and well-tested code -- the author relies on it
           every day and it has never lost mail, not even in experimental
	   versions.

	*  Large user community -- fetchmail has a large user base (the
	   author's beta list includes well over two hundred people).  This 
	   means feedback is rapid, bugs get found and fixed rapidly.

The fetchmail code appears to be stable and free of bugs affecting
normal operation (that is, retrieving from POP3 or IMAP in single-drop
mode and forwarding via SMTP to sendmail).  It will probably undergo
substantial change only if and when support for a new retrieval
protocol or authentication mode is added.  See the distribution files
NEWS for detailed information on recent changes and NOTES for design
notes.

You can easily fetch the latest version of fetchmail via FTP from the
following FTP directory:

Just chase the link to Eric's Freeware Collection.  Besides fetchmail, it
includes a tasty selection of Web authoring tools, programmer's aids,
graphics libraries, compilers for bizarre languages, games, and 
miscellaneous interesting hacks.  Enjoy!
