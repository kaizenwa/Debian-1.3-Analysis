This is the README file for the AKS procmail library.

See below for some information on procmail itself.


Here is a quick synopsis of the files:

Makefile	a Unix Makefile to help install these libary
		files in /usr/local, or another location.

README		This file.

ackmail.rc	a set of recipes which perfom auto-acknowledgement
		of incoming mail.  This file uses guess-mua.rc and
		unread-mh.rc.  See ackmail.3 for details.

commands.help	A file of information sent in response to a mail
		request of "Subject: help info".  See "commands.rc".
		
commands.rc	A set of recipes which recognize commands in the
		Subject: header and perform them.  A log is kept
		of all such commands.

dupcheck.rc	A recipe file which removes duplicate mail.

get-from.rc	A recipe file which extracts the "best" address,
		including personal information from the various
		originating address fields.

guess-mua.rc	A recipe file which attempts to guess the current
		MUA (Mail User Agent).  Not needed of MUA is 
		explicitly defined.

headers.rc	Defines some variables which can be used for matching
		against headers.
		

proclint	A Perl script which attempts to parse and pick "lints"
		from procmail scripts.

unread-mh.rc	A recipe file which attempts to compute how many unread
		messages there are for an MH user.
