# Just count how many messages in $DEFAULT


UNREAD=no			# default output

# There are two basic methods: a fast way and a slow way

# The fast way (loses sometimes -- but, really, who cares? we're
# just counting unread messages.)

* ? test -f $DEFAULT
{ UNREAD=`egrep -c '^From ' $DEFAULT` }

# The slow way, but, the "procmail" way :^)
