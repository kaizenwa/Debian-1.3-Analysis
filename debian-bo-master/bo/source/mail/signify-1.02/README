Signify is a neat little program that allows a random signature to be
generated from a set of rules.  Each section can be one of an unlimited
number of possibilities, each with its own weighting so those really cool
quotes can appear more often than others.  Sections can also be placed next
to each other vertically to create columns.  Each section can be formatted
independently as left/right/center and top/bottom/vcenter.

There is nothing to compile, just do

	# make install PREFIX=<prefix>

If not specified, the prefix will default to "/usr/local".

To see some example signatures, try the following:

	$ signify --input=examples/Simple
	$ signify --input=examples/Columned
	$ signify --input=examples/SimpleOrColumned
	$ signify --input=examples/Complex

Then copy one of these to your home directory under ".signify" and
make your own signatures for the world to see.
