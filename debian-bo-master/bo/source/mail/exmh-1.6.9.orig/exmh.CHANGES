1.5.2 12/21/94
    New FAQs
	15. How do I set up the templates for mail messages.
	16. How do I get a copy of mail I sent saved into a folder (easily).
    SEDIT
	If Attempt MHN is set, MIME headers are stripped out
	If 8-bit characters are detected, content-transfer-encoding
	    is either quoted-printable or 8bit
	8bit is no longer a character set choice in preferences
	Added kinput special case bindings as well as Hook_TextBind
	   bind Text <Control-backslash> {kinput_start %W over}
	   bind Text <Control-Kanji> {kinput_start %W over}
	   bind Text <Control-Shift_R> {kinput_start %W over}
	Fixed sedit($t,part) initialization bug
	Fixed ancient bug with Cancel on Insert Part
	Fixed abort problem after Mime Preview
    PGP

	"Print as text" option is only in the menu if there
	    is not already a mailcap rule that knows better.
    URI - from Martin Hamilton and friends:

	Uri_ => URI_
	more kinds of URI are recognised, e.g. HTML anchors

	URIs behave more like regular buttons
	copy/paste URIs without launching Internet infobrowser
	face canvas raised and clickable only if X-URI: header present

    Guard against bad value for ftextLines (scan listing lines)
    Fixed sizing of Color Legend.
*** Attempt to preallocate colors used for MIME display and URI buttons.

	c_uriAbg - active background. default is white. (when mouse is over it)
	c_uriAfg - active foreground. default is black.
    Changed faces foreground color to be set by the
	*Face*Canvas.foreground resource
	(you get a gold star if you figured out what the resource used to be.)
    Fixed O'reilly typo in the man page.

1.5.1 12/2/94  Bug fix/minor tweaks over 1.5
    Fixed cursor in message display area.

	same message and the right thing happens.
    Fixed drafts folder name used in bug report/registration mailings
	(REMEMBER TO REGISTER YOUR USERS with the item under Help... :-)

    Added confirmation dialog when there are pending changes
	and you need to commit (Ben Johnson).  The use of this dialog
	is controlled with the new commitDialog Scan Listing preference.
    Cleaned up window position saving to eliminate junk entries.
    Fixed Reply All to use -cc cc -cc to instead of -cc all

1.5 11/22/94
    Please register as an exmh user with the Register entry under Help.
    Fixed Entry class bindings to do word select and honor the
	type-kills-selection setting.
    Added
	Msg_LineDown, which is bound to the up arrow
	Msg_LineUp, which is bound to the down arrow
    Simplified error handler unique window name choice.
    SEDIT
	Added SeditMimeParse to read MIME structure in drafts messages.
	Fixed up detection of 8-bit typein.
	Moved X-Mailer header up to the top.
	Added 8-bit encoding in headers (=?iso-8859-1?Q?=C6?=)
	Fixed character set typing so 7-bit messages are us-ascii while
	    8-bit characters are the chosen iso encoding.  This is done
	    wholesale, so if a multipart message has any 8-bit characters,
	    then all the text/* types are promoted to the same 8-bit
	    character set.  Similarly, 8-bit info in the headers will
	    promote all the text parts to an 8-bit charset.
    Cleaned up new command binding interface so it really works.
    Changed MH Tweaks "Send in background" to default to OFF
	so that (new) users get error messages right when they send.
    Changed Send button so that in the Drafts folder you open the
	current message as the draft.
    Added Exwin_ToplevelFocus, ExwinSetFocus, and ExwinSaveFocus to
	cleanly handle the new focus policy, which honors the users
	main focus model.  Focus within an exmh window is still
	click to type, but you can shift focus among the various
	top-level exmh windows in your "normal" way 
	(i.e., focus-follows-mouse works ok)
    Added Pgp_ShowMessage as the handler for application/pgp MIME type
    Simple Edit bindings:
	Now Entry widgets drag-scroll with the same button as Text widgets.
    Fixed up bogus message in File Select dialog.
    More cleanup of PGP from Stefan Monnier.
    The PGP bin path is now part of the install process.
    Added Aliases_CheckPoint to send path so that you don't have to
	remember to save aliases before sending a message.

1.5minus 11/14/94
    Fixed Entry edit bindings for delbol, delwordback, transpose
    Added several convenience Tcl procedures to avoid specifying
	lots of parameters to the more general procedures
	Msg_First - go to first message in the folder
	Msg_Last - go to the last message in the folder
	Msg_CompUse - use current message as draft
	Msg_RemoveNoshow - remote, advance, but don't show next message
	Msg_MoveNoshow - refile, advance, but don't show next message
	Msg_PageOrNext - scroll or advance (space binding)
	Msg_PageDown
	Msg_PageUp
	Msg_CopySelection
	Folder_Unseen - change to next folder with unseen messages

	fileselect..  Added Exwin_ToplevelFocus procedure.
    Fixed Redistribute (again)
    SEDIT -
	Added Hook_SeditInit
	Added Compose Key sequences to generate 8-bit characters.
	    See the Compose Key menu entry under the main Bindings... menu
	Added automatic Quoted-Printable encoding (sedit only)
	Added automatic text/plain; charset=  MIME types for plain messages
	    Control these via Preference settings
		Quote Default: automatic always never
		Specify Charset: ON/OFF
		Default charset: us-ascii iso-8859-1 iso-8859-2 iso-2022-jp
	Reorganized buttons and menus a bit to save menubar space.
	Default send keybinding is <Control-c><Control-c>
	Added quoted-printable hack to Insert @ - it will decode
	    the message you are replying to so it inserts 8-bit characters.
    Bindings Dialog -
	Now only non-system-default settings are saved to ~/.exmhbindings
	Pressing Return in a keybinding entry changes the binding right away.
    Default Folder-Order is now
	inbox *
	so that inbox will appear first in your folder labels (by default)
    Pgp_Process is called on all out-going mail messages so any editor can
	insert the pgp-action: pseudo-header to get PGP wrapping
	    pgp-action: encrypt
	    pgp-action: signclear
	    pgp-action: signbinary
	    pgp-action: encryptsign

    Added Ftoc_NewFtoc and overhauled ftoc(lineset) management.
    Nuked *c_label resource - use *Label.foreground instead.
	If you don't like all the blue labels, set this to black.
    Changed Pick "New FTOC" checkbutton to a regular button.  It works at
	any time to replace the scan listing with only those messages
	that have been selected.
    Fixed old bug where pick "add to sel" didn't really work.
    Cleaned up color resources.  Now you can get reverse video in monochrome:
	*Background: black
	*Foreground: white
	*c_background: black
	*c_foreround: white
    Added watch cursor when displaying MIME messages
    Fixed glitches in multipart composition
    Fixed line breaking so it only happens on text/ parts,
	this should eliminate most needs to disable Format Mail
    MIME
	Switched to mime.types file (away from nametemplate)
	Fixed xterm use for metamail "needsterminal" rules.
	Fixed header looks when "Show Full Headers" is turned on.
	Fixed "hidden" header look.
	Handle empty body parts.
	Added new PrintBase64 routine (LoVerso)
    Added Text_CutRotate to guard against empty cutbuffer ring.
    Added <Tab> file completion to fileselection box (Christian Javet)
    Cleanup of PGP code:
	Prompts for pass phrase and runs PGP in batchmode.
	Can optionally remember your pass phrase, or you can type it in
	    each time.
	PGP in an xterm runs it interactively over a message, which is
	    useful to extract key blocks.
    All labels are blue.  Set
	*Label.foreground: black
	to restore old looks in dialogs, etc.
    Aliases:
	Handles : or ;
	- still broken with respect to commas inside quotes.
	<space> will define a new alias if what you have typed
	    does not match an existing alias.
	<Control-c> will delete the matching alias.

1.5omega 10/6/94	(definitely last development release before 1.5)
    Added install-time setting of the ps command used by BgLostPid so that
	routine doesn't have to heuristically determine the right incantation
	of ps that determines the existence of a process.
    Changed exmh-bg to use the same context as exmh so that
	private sequences work.
    Change /tmp/FACE to be /tmp/FACE.[pid] to avoid inter-user conflicts
    Fixed SeditID to work for folders with periods in their name
    Fixed Mh_MarkSeen and Mh_MarkUnseen to handle multiple unseen sequence names

    Fixed Aliases_CheckPoint so it doesn't always write the aliases file.
    Cleaned out most hardwired widget looks attributes and specify everything
	in app-defaults.  This allows users to override things via their
	own resources.  (Thanks to Jay Sekora)
    Made preferences panes resizable.
    Print out any exit-time errors.
    Fixes sedit abort dialog.
    Updated the interface to Msg_Reply, Msg_Compose, Msg_Forward, Msg_Dist
	so they take *either* the name of a Tcl command, or a set of
	arguments to be passed through to the underlying MH command.
	Now you can call Msg_Reply, for example, like this:
	Msg_Reply -nocc cc -nocc to -filter /tilde/welch/Mail/mhl.replbugfix
	Called with no arguments, these routines default to using the
	original Hook proc (Mh_CompSetup, Mh_ReplySetup, Mh_ForwSetup, etc.)
    Moved Reply buttons into a Reply menu so it is easier to add several
	variations on Reply to this menu.
    Added smarts about -anno -inplace to set mhinplace env-var (John Farrell)
    Fixed private sequences regexp to handle folders named c++ (John Farrell)
    Changed Pick dialog to use Widget_BeginEntries et. al.

	format files into MH folders.
    PGP:
	Includes fairly decent PGP code, thanks to Stefan Monnier, Anders
	    Kelmets, and William Sproule, who all enhanced the original
	    exmh PGP code contributed by Allen Downey.
	Message More... menu has
	    PGP Decrypt that replaces encrypted message with plaintext.
	    PGP View Message More... menu entry that decrypts a message but
		does not save the plaintext version in your mailbox.
	Sedit PGP menu has
	    Sign Text, Sign Binary, Sign & Encrypt, Encrypt options.
    Added "tkwait visibility" to tkerror dialog so it always manages to
	display itself.  (Vanishing dialog bug.)
    Support hacky Print command definitions that access exmh(folder) and msg(id)
	variables.  For example, you can have a print command like:
	show +$exmh(folder) $msd(id) | enscript
    Fixed handling of bogus Multipart (with no boundary line).
    Fixed handling of bogus MIME subpart with no headers and no header
	separator.
    Added aliases.tcl fix to support "< includefile" syntax (Axel Belinfante)
    Fixed installer so it really exits when you click Quit during Install.

1.5zeta 9/13/94

	and long lines continued with backslashes are handled properly.
    Added an Import button to aliases to import things from .mailrc files
    Added searching through alias lists by typing into the entry below the list
    Plugged a file descriptor leak in MimeDecode
    Fixed a typo in the man page.
    Added Default scan width to Scan Listing Preferences.
    Fixed Whom-after-Redistribute with external editor problem.
	(MH whom still barfs, but a subsequent send works ok.)
  * Using private contexts for exmh (.exmhcontext) and exmh-bg (.exmhbgcontext)
	This means that background inc should not interfere with tty MH
    Added private context for background Scan_AllFolders
  * Support MH environment variable to name alternate profile
    Fixed MimeMakeMenu so it is robust to font failures
    Fixed Preferences so it correctly saves items in entries.
    Added Prev button to preference section dialogs
    Added -sedit command line switch to override default editor

1.5epsilon 9/12/94
    Fixed Exmh_Status bug with number-like status messages
    Fixed Redistribute (really)
    Patched around auto-sign null command resource bug.
    Fixed default command bindings for PageDown and PageUp -

    Changed main buttons - introduced Help and Bindings as menus.
    Added Aliases button that brings up an interface that lets you
	edit your MH aliases file.  Thanks to Scott Stanton!

    Added sedit(colorize) preference item so you can enable/disable the
	colored backgrounds when composing MIME messages.

	Previously the bindings were just on the text.
    widgetText($t,geo) initialization patch from LoVerso
    Added Double-Tab binding in Sedit that takes you to the begining
	of the message body.
    Overall cleanup of MIME structure composition.
	If you have ----------- header/body separators, multipart
	structure will be created better.
    NOTE: Format Mail can still screw you over if you include files with
	delicate formatting.  Remember to disable it from the Sedit More...
	menu if you have important formatting.
    Tweaked popup menu placement to avoid Tk text tag binding bug. (LoVerso)

1.5delta 8/30/94
    Patches for tk-jp extension and JIS code (k. furukawa)

    Added Msg_MarkUnseen and More... menu entry for it (Fred Douglis)
    Added Folder_Purge and Folder_PurgeAll
    Fixed bogus use of Mh_Path where 'file isdirectory' would do, which caused
	bugs if you had subfolders named "new", "cur", "last", etc.
    Fixed signature file to handle blank prefernece entry for default.
    Added Mh_Sequence to read files directly instead of running pick.
    Sped up Ftoc_MarkUnseen (Catch-up Unseen bottleneck)
    Trimmed extra Folder_Summary call out of Folder_Change path.
    Tweaked labels in pick interface.
    Added Find_Reset to Msg_Show (Fred Douglis)

1.5beta 8/10/94
    Fixed management of unvisited folder list

	"new", "last", "cur", or other special MH message number ids.
    Fixed curLine == 0 problem in ftoc.tcl
    Fixed "Print via mailcap" menu entry
    Added executable signature file hack.  If the .signature file is
	executable then it is run instead of read in order to get the sig.

1.5alpha 8/8/94
    Last minor release (modulo bug fixes) before massive changes.
    New features:
    Sped up fast path of message display.  text/plain message display is
	now just about as fast as it was in 1.3.  For the last ounce of
	speed, disable the Graphic Part Separator under MIME preferences.
    Unseen Folders preferences section.  "Cycle back to first" controls
	what happens when you get to the end of the last folder and you
	type next.  If set, you go to the first folder in Folder-Order.
    Added Flist_NextUnseen which returns the next folder that has unseen
	messages in it.  At the same time, there is a small amount of
	memory about what folders you have visited in the unseen set so
	that you won't automatically revisit a folder even if it had
	unseen messages when you left.  The memory is reset after
	an Flist_FindUnseen, which happens after an Inc_Presort.
	This is not perfect, however, as it should really reset only
	when new messages have arrived in a particular folder.  This requires
	deeper changes that will appear in 1.5*.
    The keystroke capital F will take you to the next folder with unseen
	messages in it.
    Added a user interface to the various accelerator keystrokes so you
	can see what is defined, change the key bindings, and even add new
	commands with keybinding equivalents.  Type ? or click Bind.
    Changed Commit binding to <Control-Return> instead of <Return>, which
	can be dangerous if you accidentally type into exmh.
    Added Folder-Unseen to .mh_profile that defines a set of patterns (glob)
	for folders to check for new mail.  Use this to trim down the search
	through your folders for new mail.
    Changed the Folder Cache size to be line-oriented so that there are
	never phantom cached folders that are displayed off screen.
    Added Sticky folders to Folder Cache preferences so you can lock down
	folders into the cache line.
    Nuked the EDIT button - now when you are in the drafts folder you
	can just Use Message as Draft under the message More... menu.
    Bug Fixes:
    Fixed Re-edit of WhatNowDialog so the dialog box stays up and
	you can actually send/abort after re-editing.
    Nuked the Msg_ShowCurrent call from Folder_Commit to avoid an extra
	message display after a commit.
    Added a Hook_SeditSave hook point after the buffer is saved to disk
	but before it has been sent.
    Fixed annotation setup so annotations are not always made.  Now you really
	need to have -annotate in your .mh_profile entries for repl and forw.
    Added the -zero flag to the MH call that defines the current sequence to
	avoid multiple current messages.
    Changed default Folder-Ignore pattern to {.* */.* */*/.* */*/*/.*}
    Fixed Folder New dialog to reset its message about what @ maps to.
    Dinked with colors in FTOC so that current red foreground mixes with
	range, deleted, and moved looks better.
    Changed SeditFormatMail to not reformat lines that have been included
	from other message bodies using Insert @.  (Irving Reid)

1.4.1 7/21/94
    This is a bug-fix release, plus I added some more hooks (see below).
    Fixed Burst Digest so it works with auto commit.
    Fixed preferences to watch for window deletion.
    Fixed apply-to-message to honor Cancel button.
    Changed default print command from "enscript" to "lpr"
    Added Face_FlushCache for use with Tk send when you change
	your faces database.
    Fixed -iconic startup.
    Added autoPack on folder change (but its too slow to be useful)
    Fixed default signature file handling for autoSign.
    Added confirmation box for Abort on modified drafts.
    Fixed abort so it marks draft clean so they are not auto saved later.
    Nuked error message that is triggered by user-defined menus.
    Fixed background Count so it might actually work.
    Moved skipMarked into Scan Listing Preferences.
    Fixed "Unmarked -1 messages" status report.
    Added hooks that are called if you have defined them.
    See the man page for more details.
	Hook_FolderChange $folder
	Hook_CheckPoint		(called at quit time)
	Hook_SeditSend $draft
	Hook_MsgShow $pathname mimeHdr
    Fixed promotion of MIME parts to multiparts.
    Fixed typo in mimeNoteSize preferences.

1.4 6/24/94
    While the change log is still long, I've decided this is good
	enough for a stable release.  I've swept my mail log for easy
	feature requests and simple bug fixes.
	Internal guinea pigs have been testing this.
    New feature - Next changes to the first folder in your Folder-Order
	if you are at the end of the current folder and there are no
	folders with unseen messages in them.  You might want to ensure
	that your .mh_profile has at least the following:
	Folder-Order: inbox *
    Added Print Postscript menu entry and associated Postscript Print
	command to Preferences.  This is for when you receive a non-MIME
	message that contains a postscript file.
    Added more general Apply to body & Apply to message commands that will run
	a UNIX command on the message or on a temp file containing 
	the message body.
    Cleaned up scan listing scroll behavior during background incs.
    ftocShowNew resource controls whether the scan listing is scrolled
	automatically when new messages arrive.
    Added optional-advance Preference item for Link operation.  That is,
	if you link a message to another folder you can set a preference
	option to control whether or not you automatically go to next msg.
    Fixed Edit Message if you have exmh-async editor command with clever
	{-geometry 80x50} options.
    Updated the Help text.
    Added an FAQ button that displays the exmh.FAQ file.
    Added catches to background Update Scan Cache script.
    Fixed startup of TK-aware editors.  They get two arguments, the name
	 of the exmh interpreter and the name of the draft file.
    Clicking on a folder label deiconifies the main window if you
	have a detached folder display and iconified main window.
    Quit button catches errors.
    Sedit resets default signature file used with auto-signature.
    Sedit catches errors from Attempt Mhn.
    Fixed color specification of nested folder popup for monochrome displays.
    Fixed focus for Find popup.
    Fixed focus for New Folder popup.
    Cleaned up conflict between current looks and moved/deleted looks.
    Added -width 100 to inc calls.
    Changed Presort Inc to remove messages from temporary folder as
	they are refiled instead of once at the very end.  This has
	better fail-stop semantics (no duplicates later on.)
    Fixed focusing in pick window
    Added Sequence entry to Pick to add results to a sequence.
    Added fontSize, titleSize, and noteSize MIME preferences to control
	font sizes.  
    Fixed display of message parts with no headers.
    Fixed bugs with other borderline message formats.
    (Look for a pre-release version of PGP support in misc/exmh_pgp.tcl)

1.4zeta 6/10/94
    This should be quite close to the "stable" 1.4 release, but
	enough code changed to keep me from taking that leap.
    Added a call to User_Init to exmh-bg so that users can tweak
	the behavior of the background process, which does incs.
    Fixed Edit message so that it doesn't invoke the What Now dialog
	if you have an external editor.  It still isn't perfect because
	the message display is not updated after the edit is complete.
    Added support for an editor command of "emacsclient &", which will get
	transformed into "emacsclient $filename &". exmh assumes
	that you can send the message directly from your emacsclient
	and you avoid the WhatNow dialog.
    Fixed ancient bug with Exmh_Status call for POP .xmhcheck entries.
    Fixed interaction between unseen and delete/moved looks in
	the ftoc display.
    MIME:
	Made the direct showing of images a settable option in Preferences.
	Fixed the "view via mailcap command" menu entry.
	Added catches against errors that happen when you close the
	    pipeline from an exmhshowproc
	Added support for ----- header/body separators
	Handle empty body parts and non-existent messges.
	Handle lack of headers in message parts.
    Changed "textKillsSel" behavior so that setting the insert point
	clears the current selection.  This seems safer, but I'm open
	to feedback.
    Tweaked the color current message FTOC highlight to have a white background
	(c_currentBg default value)

1.4epsilon 6/7/94
    Added Msg_UUdecode that simply runs uudecode over the message.
	(This is a stop-gap and is still rather lame.)
    Fixed a bug in Preferences that would forget the color Xresources
	after a save, resulting in a mixture of colored windows.
    Fixed Preferences to better handle deletion of its windows.
    Added support for TK-aware editors.
	Specify your editor command with a trailing & and it will get
	invoked in the background with two arguments:
	the first is the name of the exmh interpreter,
	the second is the name of the draft message file.
    Fixed to handle -mono correctly and ignore other -arguments
    Added autoSign option for the built-in editor.
    Added default signature file preferences entry.
    SeditSign will append a part to a multipart message, if appropriate.
    Added error checking to button and menu creation.
    Added catch around Find regexp call.
    Added more Xresources to help folks with greylevel displays
    The following are honored in the scan listing (folder display not done yet)
	c_currentBg
	c_unseenBg
	c_deletedFg
	c_movedFg
    Exposed the time period used when dragging a selection off the screen
	as a Preference item under the Text Widget section.
    Fixed handling of header lines that were continued on multiple lines.
    Added showSeparator MIME preference entry.
    Added mailcap_checkrule
    Changed default Part type to: "text/plain; name=\"[file tail $name]\""
    Nuked uuencode encoding option.
    Updated app-defaults to properly disable things in the More... menu
    Changed the Copy button to Link to better reflect its function.
    Fixed the "unknown command "blue"" bug with First Unseen.
    Nuked hardwired -bg white from install entries

1.4delta 6/3/94
    Added Msg_Send to use the current message as a draft template.
    Added Msg_Edit to edit the current message.
    scan.tcl will use the mh_profile scan-proc, if it is defined (else scan)
    Added Send_Error to deal with Mh_Send erorrs (thanks to Jim Fulton)
    Added Copy - (refile -link).  <Shift-Button-3> on the folder label
	or use the Copy button.
    Tweaked sedit for use on non-drafts folder messages.
    Added two MH preferences
	asyncSend - by default this is enabled and is the old behavior.
	    If you disable asyncSend, then MH send is done in the foreground
	    and errors are trapped, giving you a chance to re-edit the draft.
	scan-proc - set here or in your .mh_profile - oriented towards
	    a new threaded scan (tscan) by Jim Fulton
    Added Mh_CompUseSetup and Mh_Copy
    Fixed handling of duplicate header lines.
    Fixed text/plain in multiparts.
    Added Mime_ShowImage for image/gif in order to optimize dilbert newsgroup.
    Fixed Rich_TagClear bug

1.4gamma 6/2/94
    Fixed scan caching after Rescan Folder (old bug)
    Fixed editor What Now dialog if you have multiple ones up (LoVerso)

	parts of a multipart message.
    Changed preferences help text for ftextLines
    Fixed plain iso-8859 font family in app-defaults
    Restored inline header display (scroll-off-top)
    Optimize font choice for vanilla messages to be whatever the
	Xresource setting for the message display text widget is.
    Nuked white background of rim in fileselect box
    Tweaked Entry foreground and background in app-defaults-color
    Added cursor changing to popup menus (Josh Littlefield)

1.4beta 6/2/94
    Split app-defaults-color out of main app-defaults.
    Also support ~/.exmh-defaults-color and ~/.exmh-defaults-mono
    Fixed fdispPopup bug with folder names that were numbers
    Added $env(METAMAIL_HOME)/mailcap to set of files
    MIME:
	Fixed header look tags
	Fixed external-body accessMethods
	Fixed display of drafts with ---- header separator
	Added fastpath for text/plain to ParseSingle
    Improved Insert File multipart dialog message
    Eliminated stray "Multidrop needs .xmhcheck mapping file" message.

1.4alpha 5/26/94
    New mime.tcl and msgShow.tcl thanks to Chris Garrigues (cwg@mcc.com)
    mailcap.tcl thanks to Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>
    Updated editor.tcl to deal with mxedit 2.4
    Ignore folders -fast -recurse error output.
    Force cache rescan after Pack and Sort

    Added use of env(LOGNAME) along with env(USER) for sys V folks
    Fixed busy.tcl cursor and bitmap specifications

1.3 4/7/94

    Fixed infinite recursion bug related to auto-commit.
    Fixed undefined ftoc(pickend) bug caused by unexpected event ordering.
    Fixed color parsing bug in MIME color shading.
    Fixed ftp message bug after MIME file transfer.
    Fixed regsub bug due to TCL 7.0
    Improved handling of default text and multipart MIME types - Chris Garrigues

1.3delta 3/31/94
    Beefed up initial rendez-vous between front and back-end.
    MIME User Interface Change:
	In-line text buttons have been replaced with a popup menu
	that is obtained with the right mouse button (Chris Garrigues).
	In fact, all MIME messages have a menu defined, and you'll get
	it by clicking anywhere on a message.  The menu changes with
	multi-part messages, allowing to you save or process different
	parts of the message.
    Fixed $ (last) and ^ (first) keystroke bindings.
    Clear message display if you select a message without displaying it
	(right mouse button, typing a number, or $ or ^)
    Fixed typo in error handler that botched scrolling in error popup.
    Added synchronization to folder-change in order to preserve scan caching.
	Background folder operations are nice, but they were resulting in
	scan cache invalidations.  This is a quick and sure fix pending
	a more complete rewrite of folder operation handling in 1.4
    Added User_Bindings hook to user.tcl. (John LoVerso)
    Added scroll acceleration preferences (John LoVerso)
    Fixed folder delete of just "@"
    Added folder push and pop to Inc_Presort in order to preserve
	the current folder context.
    Added Search: field to Pick dialog.
    Added synchronization to "New FTOC" feature of Pick so pending folder
	operations are not lost.
    Added Busy Inidicator preference item so you can dink the cursor or
	choose to display a bitmap in the logo area instead. (John LoVerso)
    Changed font sizes in richtext from pixels to points (Sjoerd Mullender)

1.3gamma 3/18/94
    Added warning against versions of TK earlier than 3.3
    Updated the exmh.FAQ
    exmh-async - added extra eval so you can pass arguments through wish:
	exmh-async xterm {-geo +0+0} -e {vi -horrible pattern}
    Added Msg_ShowWhat, and ~ (first) and $ (last) keybindings
    Fixed booleans to allow True, TRUE, or true Xresource values.
	(ditto for False, FALSE, false)
    Update Folder summary info after scans better.
    Fixed typo that broke srolling in error dialog stack traceback
    Added per-draft WhatNowDialog
    Moved X-Face up to highest priority face display.
    Nuked Fdisp_ClearHighlights so blue labels don't blink.
    Added inc-on-map (open icon)
    Auto-commit now occurs when you iconify (unmap).
    Added Sedit_CheckPoint to save dirty drafts when you quit exmh.
    Added delbol to delete-to-beginning-of-line.
    Added "Attempt mhn" option under the sedit More.. menu so you
    can run your message through mhn to expand MIME directives.
    Added preferences to control the default values for Format Mail and
	Attempt mhn check menu items.
    Nuked MAILDROP warning.
    Beefed up error handling during startup.
    Added BgAction to run things in the background interpreter (Flist)
    Added various Simple Editor preferences for the built-in editor.
    Added scrollSpeed and placeToplevel preferences.
    Fixed size problem with WhatNowDialog and Whom.
    Save detached folder display width and height.
    Nuked drop-shadow and folder labels in the cache line.
    Fixed Find.
    Disallow spaces in folder name.
    Fixed reordering bug in bulk refiles
    Added push/pop to eliminate MyIncTmp as current folder (Inc_Presort)
    Added (optional) feedback to Inc_Presort.
    Added -list to pick calls
    Moved MIME handler definitions into app-defaults
    Tweaked Header-Display and Header-Supress handling.  The algorithm is
	show by default
	if header matches a pattern in Header-Supress - don't show.
	    Default pattern is .* (everything)
	if header matches a pattern in Header-Display - show it.
	    Default pattern is {subject from date to cc}
    Added <Key-Left> <Key-Right> <Key-Up> <Key-Down> bindings
    Allow empty bindings (disables feature)
    Correctly handle prefix bindings - <Control-x><Key-Delete>, etc.
	I have to make <Control-x> harmless because of the way TK works.
    Re-enabled 8-bit character input
    Fixed Plain look in Text... menu
    Properly support RFC822 types (and multipart/digest)
    Added ISO font Preference option, and automatically use this

    Run metamail handler in the background.
    Disable input to status entry widget.
    Fixed fileselection to restore the cwd of the exmh process after
	the selection is made.  You can no longer select directories, either.

1.3beta 2/17/94
    Update face search path to look for
	1: first non-unknown face
	2: X-Face header
	3: first unknown face
    Added Fdisp_ClearHighlights to Flist_FindUnseen
    Added Widget_TextInitText to SimpleText widgets (e.g., color key)
    Added check for env(MAILDROP)
    Fixed BgLostPid to handle Sys V ps.
	Tested on IRIX, OSF/1, SunOS
    Fixed Folder Delete
    Changed Inc_Presort to handle variants of inc that exit non-zero
	when they have actually done some useful work.
    Fixed Pick dialog - extra Dismiss button, botched Clear.
    Added MIME Preferences: enabled, showType, showPrelude
    Display Content-Description for multiparts.
    Fixed space/quote problem on Content-Type parameters (e.g., boundary)
    Built-in editor, sedit
	Moved Sign button/menu back to be next to the Send button.
	Clear Whom display after Dismiss
	Added <Tab> binding that moves through mail headers.

1.3alpha 2/10/94
    Mainly due to the use of [pwd], exmh requires TCL 7.0 or greater.
    The installation procedure has the notion of different configurations.
	Upon startup in a fresh directory, it will look for ../*/.exmhinstall
	so you should be able to latch onto your 1.2 config info.  There is
	also a Conf button that lets you manage .exmhinstall.* if you
	need to configure exmh differently for different architectures,
	for example.
    Added startup dialog for new users that have no MH environment.
    Added message annotation for Replied:, Forwarded:, Resent:
	You enable these by -annotate flags in your ~/.mh_profile
    Added pid-based error checking between front-end and background process.
    Changed to two-level Preferences scheme so each module has its own
	sub-dialog for its own settings.  This is done to get more screen
	real-estate so I can expose more knobs and dials.
    New preference items exposed:
	autoCommit, impliedDirection, nextGuard, constraintedTextScroll
	constrainFtoc, scrollContext
    Added Scan_AllFolders, which  forks a wish process to rescan all folders,
	or just folders that are out-of-date.
    Added "uname -a" output to error report.
    Added synchronization between background rmm/refile and
	folder operations like sort, pack, and quit. (Background_Wait)
    Introduced Xresources for more colors:
	c_label - for main, folder, and message labels.
	c_st_normal - color of normal status messages.
	c_st_error - color of error status messages.
	c_st_warn - color of warning status messages.
	c_st_background - color of status messages from background process.
	    CHANGE - this used to be bgMsgColor.
    Introduced ubuttonlist and umenulist Xresources to make it easier
	to add buttons to the default set.
    Sedit - reorganized buttons.  Insert file uses file selection box.
	Improved keystroke bindings and selection handling thanks to
	some code from Dave Nichols.  You can choose what button, if any,
	to use for drag-scrolling, and can use <Button-2> for selpaste.
    Switched from FSBox to fileselect, based on something from Mario Silva.
    Added sound(multifile) option in case your play command can handle
	multiple sound files.  Results in one exec done in the background.
    Added Fdisp_ResetHighlights so the Flist button should reset all highlights
	in case things have changed out from under it.
    Added Exwin_Toplevel so that toplevel windows can have their locations
	remembered between exmh sessions.  There is no need to adjust
	the *position resources by hand.
    Added support for --- header separator for viewing draft messges.


1.2 1/14/94
    This release includes changes to the installation procedure to make testing
	simpler.  The Test button automatically takes care of setting the
	Script library to ./lib.  The Save button has been removed, and
	the save is done for you automatically when you Patch the script.
    New features:
	Save to file - save the selected message(s) to a file - dead simple.
	Spell... and Find SEL in the built-in editor.  Also rather simple.
	    Spell runs the UNIX spell program and displays the output in
	    a second pane (like the Whom output).  You can select words
	    here and then use the Find SEL operation to locate them.
	    There are obvious deficiencies like to keybindings for this
	    search and no integration with the Find popup - this is due
	    to structural deficiencies that will be fixed in 1.3
    Bug fixes:
	MIME FTP access.  I'm taking a multi-pronged approach.  In Preferences
	you can select four different ways to try this:
	    expect: use the ftp.expect script - best, but requires expect
	    ftp -n: use ftp with the no-auto-login flag
	    ftp: use ftp and pipe the user and password info at it.
	    metamail: let metamail try to handle it.
	You can also set the name of the ftp command in Preferences if it
	    needs to be something other than "ftp".
	Metamail windows - I let metamail pop up xterm on its own, and this
	    behaves better - the window stays there so you can see its contents
	Fixed SeditMsg to use an entry widget, not a label, so I do not have
	    to call "update" to get the change to display in a timely way.
	    The update call is dangerous and led to some errors when folks
	    clicked twice on the Send button.
	Fixed Mh_Rmm and Mh_Refile to make multiple calls to exec with
	    a limited number of message numbers so as not to overwhelm
	    the argc, argv array of the invoked program.  This should
	    fix bugs reported when refiling and deleting large numbers of msgs.
	Added bombproofing against folders with + in their name.
	Guard against missing scan listing entries in MarkSeen.
	Fixed use of mh_profile Inbox: entry
	Fixed up optimization of text/plain MIME display.
	For MIME multipart/alternative, display all choices if exmh
	    cannot directly handle any of them.
	Added support for message/rfc822 - treat like text/plain for now.
	Trimmed .signature*~ out of the signature set

1.2delta 1/6/94
    This release is several minor bug fixes, and a few minor feature additions:
    Set Xresource *autoCommit to get Exmh to commit changes as needed.
    Added binding for <minus> that will show the previous message
	even if it is marked for move or delete.
    Added "Catchup Unseen" menu item to mark all unseen messages in a
	folder as seen.
    Added support for @-relative names in folder create/delete dialogs.
    Bug fixes:
    Added MISC to faces search path so root and deamon look cuter.
    Fixed X-Face handling so these compressed faces to not "stick".  This only
	happened if you did not have a facesaver database.
    Beefed up Folder_Summary and Folder_Change to handle non-existent dirs.
    Fixed class definitions for some frames to not be "Entry".
    Fixed Mh_Unseen to split things so the return value doesn't
	have newlines, this broke "Mark Seen".
    Guard against folks that have directories named "@"
    Beefed up Mh_Cur against folders that have + in them,
	falling back to Mh_CurSafe if needed.
    Guard against folks that have empty Mh-Sequences: profile entires.
    For procmail users: added Inc_PresortFinish to background flist so that
	scan listing is updated, as well as folder labels getting highlighted.
    Added -nocase to message body search.
    Allow deleting non-existing folders so the display gets cleaned up.
    Decoupled Help and Color Code display.
    Added support for mhProfile(inbox) specifications.
    Added [string trim] to remove blanks from Content-Type specifications.
    Optimized MIME text/plain display.
    Fixed initialization state of the icont flag.
    Added Widget_TextLineDown and Widget_TextLineUp, but there are still
	no keybindings for those yet.
    Patched around fdisp(maxy,canvas) undefined bug.
    Fixed a typo in the MIME FTP transfer.
    Catch the Password prompt from some FTPs that TCL thinks is an error msg.
    Fixed header mark that separates body and header in sedit so you can
	create text/enriched as you expect.
    Fixed Exwin_IconPosition to properly handle "-0" coordinates

1.2gamma 12/21/93
    Install tweaks suffix of man page file to match directory.
    INCOMPATIBILITY - changed button and menu definitions to be completely
	driven by Xresource specifications in app-defaults.
    Added folder and message selection via type-in:
	+ changes focus to the status entry (a hack)
	Subsequent +'s toggle you between choosing Target and Change folder.
	<space> does folder name completion.  Keep hitting space to get more.
	<Return> sets the folder choice.
	<Control-u> clears your type-in.
	<Control-c> bails out of the operation
	For message selection, just typing digits warps focus to the
	    status entry and selects message
	Hit <Return> to view the selected message.
    Find over FTOC and Message body warns you when it will wrap.
    Fixed Folder_Summary, the replacement for running the MH folder command.
    Added header mark so seditMime can disallow enriched text in headers.
    Fixed bug in the abort button of sedit's buffer-dirty dialog.
    Eliminated fcache enabled toggle switch.  Just set the folder cache
	size to 0 to eliminate the folder cache display.  Works dynamically
	when you change the size in Preferences.
    Guard against ++ files in presort inc.

1.2alpha 12/2/93
    MIME support!
	Simple composition support in sedit.  There are some looks bugs in
	the composition window, but the outgoing message is formatted ok.
	Doesn't generate multipart messages, either nothing or text/enriched.
	Viewing MIME: richtext and enriched (subsets, but with x-color!)
	Multipart bodies (recursively) supported.
	application/octet-stream maps to a FSBox file transfer.
	Everthing else is punted to metamail.
    Added -mono to force startup in monochrome color model (for 8bit gray folks)
    Tweaked <space> binding to go to the next message if at end of current one.
    Fixed hidden/unhidden display of long header lines.
    Warning - MIME message display may invoke the metamail programs
	mimencode and metamail.  I forgot to put in something to disable MIME.
    Default installation paths are now /usr/local oriented (not PARC'ish)

1.1 11/29/93
    Bug fixes only - no new features over 1.0
    editor.tcl checks against no drafts folder before starting editor.
    faces.tcl checks against no face(path) better.
    flist.tcl uses $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) instead of "unseen" when looking
	at private sequence information (in the context file).
    Fixed typo in mh.tcl that kicks in during an error condition.
    Ftoc_FindMsg guards against {} msgid that lead to
	ftoc(curLine) getting set to 0, which leads to a later error
	about bad text index "0.end".
    Pick dialog "Mark Unseen" doesn't die if there is nothing selected.
    Added Exmh_Debug message when running exmhshowproc (msgShow.tcl)

1.0 11/23/93
    Key bindings for Text and Entry widgets are now global and not
	buried inside the built-in editor.  This is manifest as a "Bind"
	button between Preferences and Color/B&W. It also means your
	keystrokes are understood in the error dialog box.
    PageUp <Meta-v> and PageDown <Control-v> added to bindings.
    Changed the "Key" button name to "Color" or "B&W" depending on colormodel.
    Added "Burst Digest" to the messages More... menu.  If you know MH burst,
	the default is not to burst -inplace, but you can get that behavior
	with an mh_profile entry (burst: -inplace).
    Changed "Next Unseen" menu entry to "First Unseen" to match its behavior.
    Built in editor, sedit:
	Changed "FileMenu" to "More..."
	Changed its "Prefs" button to "Bind"
	Nuked replPrefix from that dialog.  Instead you have to set an
	    Xresource, *replPrefix, in your ~/.exmh-defaults.
	    Trailing spaces in the prefix are ok, leading are impossible.
	    The replPrefix is used with "Insert @", by the way.
	Split binding stuff out into seditBind.tcl
    Fixed code that writes .mh_sequences to use rename (mv) in order
	to avoid trashed sequences files.
    Fixed mis-feature that changed your folder to one with unseen messages
	if you right click on a folder label (to choose a target) and
	there is no current message.
    Auto bug reports now include TCL and TK version numbers
    Nuked hardwired position for WhatNow dialog, which now has the
	Xresource class WhatNow.  Ditto for New folder dialog.
    Added support for Fltop.iconposition resource.
    Fixed -iconic command line arg so that Fltop starts iconic to.
    Added "bad key" binding to undefined keys in message window.
    Added *position and *Pick.position definitions to app-defaults.
    Fixed sound preferences so you can override sound files and command.
    Added Flist_MsgSeen call during Commit do deleting unseen messages
	still lets the flist module (and folder display) keep up to date

1.0epsilon 11/19/93
    Forward now handles multiple messages (just like MH forw)
    Folder Rescan now checks against pending changes before going for it.
    "no messages" error is no longer inserted into the scan listing.
    faces.tcl overhauled to support FACEPATH, people.tab, and machine.tab
    Added ability to delete folders.
    In sedit:
	Changed "Keys" to "Prefs" because you can now set the prefix
	used when inserting @, the message to which you are replying.
	Inserting @ also strips the headers.
    Changes to the Folder More... menu:
	Added Msg_ShowSomething to Rescan, Pack, and Sort folder menu commands.
	For Pack and Sort this results in the last message of the folder being
	displayed.  For Rescan it results in either the first unseen message
	or the current message being displayed.
	Added "Delete folder" menu entry
    Subtle change to highlighting current and target nested folders:
	These highlights no longer propogate up the hierachy like the
	unseen highlights do.  This is to avoid a highlighting bug when
	in the "redisplay" mode (as opposed to using pop-ups).
    Bug fix for the undefined "leaf" variable.
    Fixed bug with ftoc(curLine) after you remove everything from a folder.
    Fixed the no-highlight-of-unseen message bug.
    Fixed sound feedback on inbox and multidrop incs.
    app-defaults no longer specifies iconpositions

    I fixed two bugs this morning and reinstalled the tar file.)
    Fixed the -iconic and iconic: Xresource specification.

	a pick completes the same day you make the pick O(N^2) => O(N)
1.0delta - 11/16/93
    Added Msg_Seen to return list of seen messages in the current folder
    Moved MsgParseFrom to msgShow.tcl
    Fixed MsgShowInText to pass complete (continued) from line to MsgParseFrom

	m_tagnames correspond to mail headers (m_subject, m_to, etc.)
    Fixed Scan_ProjectSelection to set up display state correctly.
    Added ftoc(displayDirty) to optimize cache saving.
    Restored ExmhDone for compatibility with mxedit

	are managed and generalized them to support menu entries too.
    Added More... menus for extra Fops and Mops buttons
    Optimized Mh_SetCur so it doesn't exec mark if the current message
	has not changed.
    Fixed nested folder unseen highlight/unhighlight problems.
    Added Ftoc_Init
    Moved Msg_UnSeen call to commit-time from mark time.
    Added support for exmhshowproc mh_profile entry.
    Generalized x-face header stuff so that all header lines, including
	their continuations, and stored into the msgHdr array.  For example,
	msgHdr(subject) has the subject, msgHdr(x-face) has the X-Face.
	msgHdrs is a list of all headers found.
    Realized that Text widgets do not grok geometry resources, so app-defaults
	now has entries for width and height.
    Added support for iconic Xresource (plus *Fltop.iconic resource)
    Added support for the cutbuffer command.  Paste will try and fall back
	to cutbuffer get.  The precedence is X PRIMARY selection, cutbuffer,
	and then $sedit(killbuf), which is set by deletions.
    Added <Key-U> binding to Msg_ShowUnseen to see the next unseen message

    Added headertags Xresource to support futher tweaking of the appearance
	of header lines in the message display
    Rewrote Mh_Cur to read the context files directly to eliminate the side
	effect of changing the folder context that using MH pick had done.
    Added Scan_ProjectSelection to allow pick results to replace scan output.
    Added Scan_Iterate to iterate over inc output
    Moved ScanShowUnseen to Ftoc_ShowUnseen
    Added Flist_UnseenMsgs, Flist_NumUnseen, and Flist_UnseenFolders to avoid
	accessing the flist array outside of flist.tcl
    Changed FlistAddUnseen to Flist_AddUnseen because it gets exported.
    Pack and Sort now clear the current message.
    Stubbed out all calls to Flist_Update.
    Added Sign... menu to Sedit if you have multiple ~/.signature* files
    Added "Format Mail" checkbox to the FileMenu to enable formatting.
    Clicking on Whom toggles the whom display.
    Added support for ----- headers/body separator in SeditFormatMail

    Moved text bindings into bindings.tcl
    Added <Control-w> binding to msg body that copies selection

    Re-wrote the way fdisp labels are highlighted.  All the looks definitions
	are extracted into fdispColor.tcl
    Added Preferences toggle for detached top-level fdisp display.
    Added notion of a current direction to ftoc, so after Move or Delete you
	keep going the same direction as the last Next or Prev

	when you select a deleted or moved message
    Moved ftoc color configuration into ftocColor.tcl

    Inc_Inbox no longer calls Flist_FindUnseen
    Pick dialog has "New FTOC" to results in result replacing scan display.
    Pick "Mark Seen" message now works *after* you make a selection,
	and this properly updates the highlight;s and state about unseen msgs.
    Added FdispPopupResetView from Loverso, that unshifts the fdisp canvas
	 after a popup goes down.

1.0beta - 11/4/93	(last beta, really)
    Moved MsgShowIn text into msgShow.tcl
    Add message header highlighting, controlled by exmh.headerfont resource

    Added Background_Refile and Background_Rmm so these operations can
	by the background interpreter.
    Folder display changes: allow for iconic labels.  Popdown displays now
	go away more readily.  See user.tcl for the way to define icons.
    The find popup remembers its geometry when you dismiss it.
    New folder operation will create intermediate directories if needed.
    Added Ftoc_LinesHighlight to support pick'ed ranges
    Pick dialog vastly improved (Loverso)

    Tweak icon bitmap when you read the last unseen message
    Tweak folder display when you read the last unseen message in a folder.

    Added cache of face path lookup.
    Added hook to uncompress X-face headers.
    Fixed flist row reconfiguration from Preferences.
    Added FlistAllLabels so parents of highlighted nested folders

    messages in a folder.  (This had broken Next and Prev in some cases.)
    Unbroke regexp expressions that had \t - need a real tab instead.
    Added catch against unwritable .xmhcache file.
    Beefed up sound command invocation.  Now you can define a command

    Removed update idletasks from Exmh proc.
    Fixed exmh.install to patch the wish line of exmh-async as it is installed.
    Added catch against mal-formed print command, plus a little notifier.
    Added mkdir of the drafts directory if it doesn't exist upon startup.
	(Our site initialization sets the profile entry, but doesn't make
	the folder directory.)
    Fixed Preferences to properly save entries that have multiword values.
    Fixed background msgchk so it actually works.
    More flist hacking, primarily due to John LoVerso:
	(Optional) popdown display of nested folders.
	Performace improvements in basic display.
	(Optional) top-level display as opposed to embedded frame.
	Note - button assignments are temporarily out of the preference
	    items to save space and until a better Xresources/Preferences
	    arrangement is worked out.  You can manually set
	    flist(curbutton), flist(navbutton), flist(tarbutton) in
	    the initial section of your .exmh file.
    Added Msg_CheckPoint calls to Folder_IncInbox and Folder_IncAll so
	that unseen sequence is properly updated.
    Fixed message range selection.
    Fixed ScanMerge to deal with no new messages to scan in.
    I believe this caused aborted Folder_Changes, that in turn
    caused corrupted scan caches.
    In Sedit, protect [selection get] with catch phrases.

1.0b7 - 9/17/93
    Added highlighting support for B&W displays
    Moved ExmhFolderBindings to Folder_Bindings
    Changed Tear button to "Clip"
    Change Exmh_Status to use an entry widget (not message), and changed

	Added support for private sequences (not really tested here)
	No longer rely on external flist program - all in TCL now.
	Added B&W highlighting.
	Added flistSetCache and flistParents that cache the results
	    of figuring out what folders have nested children.
	If you recompute the .folders file , the flist will be updated.
    Added Range selections to folder display.
    Fixed bug in management of unseen sequence that was tickled by deletes.
    Folder_Change no longer changes to first unseen message.
    @ file is removed after you finish your reply.
    Move and Remove operate on ranges of messages.
    Changed number of sounds for new messages to O(log4) from O(log2)
    sedit catches errors from non-existant selections.

    Fixed initial call to mhpath to use exec.
    Fixed toplevel windows so resizing doesn't obscure menubar.
    Made .* the default header-suppress pattern.
    Make what-now dialog pop up in the same place.
    Fixed flist:
	No resizing upon startup
	Proper LRU management of cached folder labels
    Added batch refile commands.  Refiles also are done in the right
    order (used to be done in reverse order.)
    Added Scan_Move that updates scan cache of refile target.
    Simple editor changes:
	Text bindings are (mostly) reflected into Entry bindings.
	Unused drafts are aborted so you don't pollute your drafts folder.

1.0b5 - 9/9/93
    Converted all the Widget_foo procedures that guard against font failures.
    First they try without an explicit font spec so that Xresources can
    take effect, but they trap errors and then supply -font fixed.
    Fixed log so it can be turned on an off after startup.
    Added app-defaults file
    Added traces to ftextLines and mtextLines so preference size changes
    happen right away without a restart.
    Added Msg_Tear button that puts the current message in a toplevel.
    Added Lefty scrollbar placement option (still requires restart)
    Reordered startup so Inc (or Flist) is done after folder change.
    Added Widget_FrameNew that defines frame class (for option stuff)
    Support mh_profile entries Header-Suppress and Header-Display that
    control which headers are shown in message display.  Suppressed
    headers are scrolled off the top.
    Preferences fixed to pick up entry values at Save and Dismiss.
    Changed default editor to sedit (or mxedit) instead of mh_profile
    value, which is almost always wrong.  You can still set your editor cmd.
    More flist overhaul.  Fixed display routines to handle re-entry that
    occurs because of nested <Configure> events.  Nuked old code.
    Added flist(font) preference option.
    Trace ftextLines, flistFont and cacheSize and redisplay when they change.
    Fixed Flist_Direct so folders with unread msgs are highlighted.
    Pack the folder labels a little tighter to save screen space (gap = 8)
    Moved .exmhflistcache to $mhProfile(path) directory from homedir.
    Added Msg_CheckPoint calls to Folder_Sort and Folder_Pack to
    preserve message sequence info.
    Fixed scan update at inc-time:
	Added use of Scan_Inc to optimize Folder_IncInbox and scan update.
	Dinked with Scan_Folder call in Folder_IncAll and Folder_IncNew.
    Introduced MsgShowInText that implements Header-Suppress and Header-Display.
    Added support for "@" symlink during replies.
    Improved error messages for Move errors (no target selected)
    Improved error messages from Msg_Find.
    Changed sound preference item to the whole sound command.
    Beefed up error checking against no sound program.
    Fixed up built-in editor:
	<Control-Return> sends the current draft.
	Window is reused, if possible.
	Button with @ label inserts current message (during replies only)
	Added feedback in title bar.
    Changed "Dismiss" button in preferences to "OK for now"


1.0b4 - 9/3/93
    Added Flist_SetLabels and nuked Flist_Display call from exmh_main.tcl.
    More fixing to the flist display.
	Middle button is the only thing that changes view.  The
	Left and Right buttons only set the current and target buttons,
	respectively.  The display can be resized and it will lay itself out.
    Added Msg_CheckPoint call to the Folder Inc routines so you don't
    loose your updates to the unseen sequence.
    Changed ScanHighlightUnseen to use MsgNumber.
    Added Msg_ShowCurrent to the Folder Inc routines so the current
    message is properly highlighted after an Inc.  Also fixed a
    bug in Msg_CheckPoint in which it didn't clear msg(seen)
1.0b3 - 9/3/93
    Major cleanup of the nested folder display impl:
	Middle click navigates without changing folders.
	Things are properly highlighted in the folder cache.
	The folder display stays at a fixed size.
	(Still not constraining the scrolling.)
    Ensure that all widgets with fonts use the Widget_Font proc to
    choose the font using the TCL option command.
    Down-cased the .mh_profile keys so that Draft-Folder and draft-folder
    are both ok.  Affects code that references the mhProfile array.
    Fixed a bug when MsgNumber returned 0.
    Fixed a bug in ScanMerge if the .xmhcache file didn't exist.
    Added a popup when running folders -fast -recurse, but
    haven't yet replaced that with something faster.
    Fixed Flist so if you don't have the flist C program it
    properly uses the Flist_Direct impl.
    Now can deal with absolute pathnames for the current folder
    (the result of running xmh.)
    Folder_IncAll (multidrop mode) now rescans the current folder.
    Nuked MsgNumber error message.
    Took Msg_Show out of the Scan procedures and moved it into
    Folder_Change so that the above change doesn't gobble unseen messages.
1.0b2 9/2/93
    This has my first attempt at displaying nested folders.
    Fixed Exmh_Status so it can be called before windows are created.
    In that case, things just go do stderr.
    Made things more robust with respect to the drafts folder.  One
    will be created if you don't already have one.  Understands syntax:
    Draft-Folder: +drafts
    Relaxed requirement dependency on the MAIL envar, and supplies
    a default (/usr/spool/mail/$env(USER)) if it isn't there.
    Will create an Unseen-Sequence mh_profile entry for you via
    a dialog at startup.
    Added more keybindings to the built-in editor, sedit.
    Fixed inbox-style incing so vanilla inc users should be ok.
    Changed over to .xmhcheck (from .exmhdrop).  Also souped that up
    so it understand either pathnames or POP hostnames.  Fixed
    Folder_IncAll accordingly, but haven't tested it.
    Right click on the folder listing selects msg, doesn't display it.
    Added Xresource option support for fonts.  Grep calls to Widget_Font
    to see what resources are queried.  Defaults to fixed.
    Changed Msg_Show to select the last message in a folder if there
    is no unseen and no cur.
    Fixed to use Unseen-Sequence value instead of hardwired "unseen".
    Fixed the repacking redisplay bug.
1.0b1 8/31/93
    Fixed a bug with the unseen message sequence.  If you visited
    a message multiple times it might get erroneously stuck onto
    the unseen sequence (by the mark command, thanks.)
1.0b 8/31/93
    Added preference items for Editor and Print commands.
    Added log to record status and debug messages.
    Guard against glob failures.
    Added Save button to exmh.install so you can save settings.
    Split exmh.install into two windows.
    Turned off incOnStartup as the default.
    Added support for .xmhcheck (it is the same as .exmhdrop)
    exmh.install guards against {cp -p} and {ps -axwww} errors
