-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Is it possible to get the cursor keys working in the editor?

    Use the Bind dialog to set additional keystroke bindings for various
    editing functions.  For cursor keys, you first need to figure out
    what their X Keysyms are.  I use the "xev" program for this.  Assuming
    the keysyms are Up, Down, Left, and Right, then you'd add
    <Key-Up> to the up1line function, etc.  The Bind dialog lets you
    have multiple sequences for a function - just space separate them.
    You may have to drag the entry widget with the middle mouse button
    to make room to add stuff to the end.

1b. Can I paste with the middle mouse button?

    This is now the default after versions 1.5.1

    Answer for older versions:
    Select Simple Edit from the Bindings menu and do two things.
    First, use the "Scroll Button" setting to change the drag scrolling
    binding from Middle to one of the other choices:
    ShiftMiddle, Right, or None.  This binding lets you "drag" a text
    window around without having to hit the scrollbar.

    Second, change  the selpaste binding to <Button-2> so you can paste
    with middle click.

2. How do I display ISO-8859 fonts so that my special characters show up?

    Put an Xresource specification into your ~/.exmh-defaults file:
    *Text*font: -*-courier-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-*
    *Ftoc*Text*font: -*-courier-*-*-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-*

2b. How do I insert special (8-bit) characters?

    There are many Compose key sequences that are defined to let you
    do this.  Your X environment may also specially map some keys.
    For a list of the Compose key sequences, select the
    Compose Key menu entry under Bindings.  Press the Compose key
    and then the two characters in the left list in order to
    get the special character on the right hand side.  You can redefine
    what the Compose key is mapped to in the Simple Edit Bindings... dialog.

3. I can't get background incorporate to work. What am I doing wrong?

    The most likely cause is that the TK send facility does not work for you
    because of Xauthority issues.  See FAQ 4a & 4b.  If you cannot get send
    working, you have two options.  First, disable the background process
    so that all periodic activity is done in the front-end.  Do this via
    the preferences entry for Background Processing.

    Another cause that might disable inc completely is lack of the MAILDROP
    environment variable.  This should be set to the name of the spool
    file that contains incoming mail (unless you are using POP).  The
    latest Exmh will warn you about this and try to choose a default
    value, but to be safe you should set this up properly.

4a. How do I get Tk send to work?

    Tk "send" lets two TCL interpreters issue commands to each other,
    and it uses the X server for communication.  Beginning with
    TK 3.3, this also honors the Xauthority protocol, unless you compile
    TK with -DTK_NO_SECURITY.  You can test this by running "wish" and
    trying out the following command:
	    send exmh {Exmh_Status "Hello, world!"}
    If this fails you need to recompile or learn how
    to start your X server so that it does Xauthority right.

    Note that even if you set up Xauthority right, you need to
    make sure the old-fashioned xhost list is empty.  Do this:
    xhost -

4b. How do I start my X server so it does Xauthority right?

    The general picture of whats going on is this:
    1) some program generates a magic cookie (arbitrary string) and writes
    this to a file.
    2) The name of this file (often ~/.Xauthority) is passed to the X server
    3) The X server writes an entry for the DISPLAY into your ~/.Xauthority
    file.
    4) Xlib reads ~/.Xauthority when you create a window, and passes the
    cookie value back to the X server.
    
    The specific details vary from server to server.
    Keven Kenny offers this Web page with details about Ultrix,
    X servers, X session managers, etc:

    http://ce-toolkit.crd.ge.com/tkxauth/

    For SunOS and openwin, you should just be able to start up with:

    openwin -auth magic-cookie

    Another person had luck with:

    BTW, the Xauthority stuff seems to work now. All I did was declare
    and export XAUTHORITY from my .profile. I had't done it before since
    the value ($HOME/.Xauthority) is supposed to be the default. We're
    using XDM.


    In more detail, here is what happens under the covers...

    if [ ! \( -d $HOME -a -w $HOME \) ]; then
      echo "Warning: Can't write X authority file" 1>&2 ;
      auth_args=""
    else
      authfname=$HOME/.xnews.`uname -n`$DISPLAY
      ${OPENWINHOME}/lib/mkcookie $authfname -auth magic-cookie
      auth_args="-auth $authfname"
    fi ;
    ${OPENWINHOME}/bin/xnews $auth_args $server_args $xnews_config_args ;;
    
    There is a more lengthy example given in the misc/Xauthority file
    that comes with the exmh distribution.

5. Where do I find Faces and Metamail packages?

    There are pointers to these packages at the end of the man page.

6. How do you get an X-Face: line into your outgoing mail messages?

    The compface program that is part of the faces package will generate
    the X-Face hex string for you.  Check its man page for details.
    If you have a 48x48 X bitmap image in X bitmap .xbm format,
    then you can convert that into an ikon format using some programs
    from the pbmplus package.  The pipeline looks like

    xbmsize48 | xbm2ikon | compface

    If you put an X-Face header in your replcomps file (see FAQ #15)
    then you need to double any % and \ in the X-Face string.  For example,
    abc%def\efg  needs to be written as abc%%def\\xyz in the
    X-Face header of your replcomps files.


6b. How do you display an X-Face: header line?

    Under the Faces preferences, set the X-Face pipeline to be similar to:
    uncompface | ikon2xbm
    (You might need absolute pathnames if these programs are not
    otherwise on your PATH).
    uncompface comes with the faces package.
    ikon2xbm comes with exmh as misc/ikon2xbm.c
    Just compile it with
    cc -o ikon2xbm ikon2xbm.c

    Note, this is slower than I'd like, plus the results are not saved
    anywhere.  The intended use of the X-Face header was that the mail
    agent would update the facesaver database in the background using it.

6c. How do you create an X-Face: header line?

    The pbmplus package of image manipulation programs can do it.
    Martin Wunderli uses the following script
    (giftopnm instead of xpmtoppm should work for you):

    #!/bin/sh
    xpmtoppm $1 | pnmscale -xysize 48 48 | ppmtopgm | pgmtopbm | pbmtoxbm | \
    xbm2ikon | compface


7. Can I use EXMH as a news reader?

    Well, it actually works ok, but there are various things that would
    make it better at reading news.  To get started, just make a symbolic
    link from your ~/Mail directory into the news spool file system.
    This requires access (e.g., NFS) to the news spool file system, of course.
    You can do it for a single newsgroup, i.e. clari.feature.dilbert.
    My symlink looks like:
    Mail/dilbert -> /net/news/news-1/news/spool/clari/feature/dilbert
    Or, you can link into the interior of the news hierarchy.
    You might run into a problem from the MH folders command that
    limits it to about 300 folders.  Change the NFOLDERS constant in MH
    src/h/mh.h from 300 to 30,000 and you shouldn't have any more trouble ;-)

8. How do I change those default wheat-colors for the widgets in EXMH?

    (See also exmh.COLORS for more color schemes...)
    Here is a set of Xresources that I use to get a grey-family for
    my TK-based applications.  You can put this into your
    ~/.exmh-defaults, or into your ~/.Xdefaults.  This works ok
    on a monochrome screen, although buttons do not highlight
    when you pass the mouse over them.

*activeBackground:			#efefef
*activeForeground:			black
*selector:				black
*background:				#dfdfdf
*foreground:				black
*selectBackground:			#bfdfff
*Scale.activeForeground:		#efefef
*Scale.sliderForeground:		#dfdfdf
*Scrollbar.foreground:			#dfdfdf
*Scrollbar.activeForeground:		#efefef
*Button.disabledForeground:		#7f7f7f
*Checkbutton.disabledForeground:	#7f7f7f
*Radiobutton.disabledForeground:	#7f7f7f
*Menu.disabledForeground:		#7f7f7f

9a. How do I get POP to work with exmh?

    First, make sure that MH has been set up for POP.
    Type "inc -help" and look for the POP option.
    If MH doesn't use POP directly, there are several packages that can
    fetch mail from a POP server:
    popclient : <ftp://ftp.mal.com/pub/pop> but Archie will find many places.
    gwpop : <ftp://ftp.pasteur.fr/pub/Network/gwpop> or 
	    <ftp://ftp.std.com/pub/mal/gwpop>, thanks to 
                Mark Lamourine <mlamouri@bbn.com>
    popc : <ftp://ftp.imag.fr/pub/Linux/net>
    popmail : <ftp://ftp.cic.net/pub/Software/unix/mail>


    Second, you need to use "multidrop" or "presortmulti" Inc styles.
    For these you set up a .xmhcheck file that specifies all your
    "dropboxes" for mail.  These can be spool files or POP servers,
    or both.  Each line of your .xmhcheck file has two or three fields:

    folder dropname popname

    "folder" is the name of a folder, without the +.  (e.g., inbox)

    If "dropname" begins with a /, then it is assumed to be a filename
    for your spool file (e.g., /usr/spool/mail/welch), and the last
    field is ignored.

    Otherwise, "dropname" is assumed to be the hostname of the POP server,
    and "popname" is your user account name on that server.  You need to
    set up a .netrc file with the password for that account so that
    inc can run non-interactively.

    With "multidrop" inc style exmh will copy mail from the dropboxes
    into the corresponding folder.

    With "presortmulti" inc style, exmh will additionally sort anything
    that has been directed into the MyIncTmp folder.  This is a special
    temporary folder used by the "presort" inc style.  To do sorting,
    you need to set up a .maildelivery file.  See FAQ 9c.

9b. What's the difference between presort and multidrop inc-styles?

    The main difference between presort and multidrop is: with
    presort, you don't need a ~/.forward that pipes your messages to slocal
    because exmh will run slocal for you.  The second difference is that
    the presort scheme assumes that messages are completely routed into
    folders, either with the + syntax (slocal patch required) or by
    piping messages through rcvstore in the .maildelivery specification.
    The multidrop scheme assumes you append messages to dropbox files
    with the '>' or 'file' command in your .maildelivery file.

    Thus your options are:
    1. use slocal in your .forward, 
       pipe your messages to rcvstore in .maildelivery,
       and have exmh do background flist updates.
    2. use slocal in your .forward, 
       append messages to files in .maildelivery,
       specify files to folders mapping in .xmhcheck, 
       and have exmh do background multidrop.
    3. empty .forward, 
       pipe your messages to rcvstore in your .maildelivery, 
       and have exmh do background presort.
    4. Note that the following DOES NOT WORK
       empty .forward,
       append messages to files in .maildelivery,
       specify file to folder mapping in .xmhcheck, 
       and have exmh do background presort.
       WON'T WORK

9c. How do I set up my .maildelivery file to filter mail?

    You need to choose "presort" or "presortmulti" inc styles,
    and then set up a .maildelivery file.  Alternatively, you
    can use "none" inc style and pipe things into slocal (or procmail)
    in your .forward file as discussed in FAQ 9b.

    Your .maildelivery file cannot be group or world writable,
    otherwise slocal just ignores it.
	chmod 644 ~/.maildelivery

    Here is a fragment of a .maildelivery file as an example:

to		b29@		+ ?	sunlabs
cc		b29@		+ ?	sunlabs
to		mtv29@		+ ?	sunlabs
cc		mtv29@		+ ?	sunlabs
subject	"Re: Register exmh user" + ?	exmh/responses
subject	"register exmh"		+ ?	exmh/register
to	exmh-users 	+	?	exmh/users
to	exmh-announce	 +	?	exmh/announce
to	exmh-workers	 +	?	exmh/workers
subject book		+	?	book
from	prenhall.com	+	?	book
default		-		+ ?	inbox

	The first column is a field name.  It can be anything, such as
	x-mailer or x-phase-of-moon

	The second field is a case-insensitive substring that has to
	appear in the field value to match.

	The third field is an operator.  The "+" is a new operator added
	to slocal by a patch that is distributed with exmh.  Look for
	misc/slocal.patch.  The + operator says "refile into a folder".
	There is another way to specify this given below.

	The fourth field is a sort of conditional.  "?" says
	"do this if the message hasn't already matched, and mark
	the message as matching after you do this."
	"A" says "do this even if the message has matchs, and mark
	the message as matching"
	"R" says "do this even if the message has matched, and don't
	even mark it as matching"

	The last field is a arguments to the operator.  If the case
	of "+", it is just a folder name.

	If you have not patched slocal, then you need to use the pipe
	operator and pipe the message into the MH rcvstore program.
	Unfortunately this is in the MH library directory that is
	never on the slocal PATH.  You need to have lines like this:

to		b29@		| ?	"/some/where/lib/rcvstore +sunlabs"
default		-		| ?	"/some/where/lib/rcvstore +inbox"


10. How do I fix the "exmh-bg lost UI {process XXXX}" message?

    First - see FAQ # 4 about Tk send and Xauthority.
    is most like a problem with the Tk send command.

    Second - if Tk send works for you, then perhaps it is a problem with
    the ps command setting for exmh(psCmd).  This is set up when
    exmh is installed and is used to query the existence of other
    processes.  On Berkeley-style systems you can just do
    /bin/ps $pid
    While on SysV-style systems you need the -p flag
    /bin/ps -p $pid

10b. What does "exmh-bg cannot rendez-vous with UI - exiting" mean?
    This is a related problem.  Tk send is not working so the
    background process cannot hook up with the user interface.
    See FAQ #4

11. How come messages are not really removed when I delete them?

    By default, MH only renames a message when you delete it.  It is either
    named ,N or #N, depending on how your system is configured.  You can
    take a few different approaches to cleaning up these files.
    1) Set up a cron job to periodically remove them.
    2) Remove them by hand, or add a Purge menu entry to do it.
    3) In your ~/.mh_profile, add a line like:
	rmmproc: /bin/rm
	This causes the MH rmm command to invoke /bin/rm to nuke the message

12. Why doesn't the flag go up when there is new mail in the spool file?

    The appearance of the exmh icon relates to the contents of your
    mail folders, not your spool file.  This reflects a bias towards
    background inc'ing, which periodically transfers (and maybe sorts)
    mail into your folders.  Check out flag.tcl for the details.

13. Why isn't there a Reply button, but only a menu?

    There are really lots of variations on reply, that's why.
    You should pick your favorite one and define a personal button
    for it so that *you* get what *you* want. You can define a repl
    button by putting these resources into your ~/.exmh-defaults file

    *Mops.ubuttonlist: myrepl
    *Mops.myrepl.text: Repl
    *Mops.myrepl.command: Msg_Reply {any valid repl arguments here}

    See the MH man page on repl for more details.  Common flags include
    -cc me -nocc me -cc all -nocc all -filter form

14. Are there newsgroups or mailing lists for discussion of exmh?

    There are three mailing lists, and an archive.

    First, and **this is important**, send subscription requests to the
    corresponding -request address, not the main lists.  Please.

    Second, subscribe to only one of the lists.  They are connected,
    so you will get duplicate mail if you join more than one.

    exmh-announce@parc.xerox.com - subscribe to this to receive announcements
	about new exmh releases.  To join, send a message to:
    exmh-announce-request@parc.xerox.com
	The body should have this format, exactly:
	subscribe exmh-announce you@your.host

    exmh-users@parc.xerox.com - subscribe to this to join a discussion of
	exmh.  This list also gets announcement messages.
	To join, send a message to:
    exmh-users-request@parc.xerox.com
	The body should have this format, exactly:
	subscribe exmh-users you@your.host

    exmh-workers@parc.xerox.com - subscribe to this to join a discussion
	among hackers that are interested in programming new stuff for exmh.
	This gets all the exmh-user and exmh-announce traffic.
	To join, send a message to:
    exmh-workers-request@parc.xerox.com
	The body should have this format, exactly:
	subscribe exmh-workers you@your.host

    The comp.mail.mh newsgroup has more information about basic MH stuff.

    The directory, parcftp.xerox.com:/pub/exmh/archive has some of the
    list messages archived.  These are files created with the packf
    program, and they are compressed.

15. How do I set up the templates for mail messages.

    MH uses 4 template files depending on the operation.  Default versions
    of the files are in the MH library directory.  Copy these defaults
    into your ~/Mail directory so you can customize them.  The files are:

    components - used when you send a new message.  Put the headers and
	any text you want in your message.  Remember to leave either a blank
	line between the headers and the body, or a line of all dashes.

    replcomps - used when you reply to a message.  This file is complex
	because it contains directives that indicate how to fill in the headers
	based on the content of the mail you are replying to.  See the repl
	man page for details.  If you want to put literal values in the headers,
	you have to double any occurences of % or \ because these are special
	characters in the formatting commands.  If you want plain text in the
	body, you have to begin these lines with a colon.  Otherwise the
	lines after the header are discarded.  The same rules about separating
	the headers and the body apply.  If you want to add comments to the
	template, start the line with a semi-colon.

    reply filters - the -filter argument to repl specifies a filter that
	inserts and formats the body of the message to which you are replying.
	See the repl man page for details.

    forwcomps -- used when forwarding a message.  This is more like the
	components file than the replcomps file.

    forward filters -- these control what headers are retained in the
	forwarded messages, and how those messages are forwarded.

16. How do I get a copy of mail I sent saved into a folder (easily).

    Use the Fcc: header, which puts a copy of your out-going mail into
    a folder.

    1) add the Fcc: header to the various component files described in FAQ #15.

    2) For replies only, you can also add a "-fcc sent-mail"
    argument to your MH profile entries for repl.

17. What is a good alternate Print command to get good formatting?

    <Ethan Miller says:>
    I use the mp package to print mail (and other files as well).
    Mailp (one of the commands in mp) prints mail nicely.
    My print command is:
    mailp -landscape -twosided -bsdprinter $file

    <Anne Possoz adds:>
    But without metamail piped to mp, in certain circumstances like
    mail coming from MacIntosh (is0-8859, quote-printable) the accents
    do not come right. That is why we use:

    metamail $file | mp -l | lp

    You can get mp at ftp.x.org in contrib/utilities.

18. How do I change the folder table of contents listing?

    This is a feature of the scan and inc MH programs.
    They take a macro file that describes how to generate this display.
    The default is buried in your MH lib directory as
    scan.form, or scan.default

    Here is what I have for the default:

%; NOTE: This file is supplied for reference only; it shows the default
%;      format string (for non-UK sites) which was compiled into "scan".
%;      See the source file "h/scansbr.h" for details.
%4(msg)%<(cur)+%| %>%<{replied}-%?{encrypted}E%| %>\
%02(mon{date})/%02(mday{date})%<{date} %|*%>\
%<(mymbox{from})%<{to}To:%14(friendly{to})%>%>%<(zero)%17(friendly{from})%>  \

    Copy this into ~/Mail/scan.form
    Add
    scan: -form scan.form
    inc: -form scan.form
    to your .mh_profile

    NOTE: Exmh depends on the output of the scan form to have the message
    number come first, followed by a character that can be either
    a space or a plus '+' to mark the current message
    So - leave this magic at the front (you can change the 4 as noted below)

    %4(msg)%<(cur)+%| %>

    Now edit the form as described below.

18a. Remove the leading words of the message

    Remove the trailing "%<{body}<<%{body}>>%>" from the scan.form

18b. Handle message numbers > 9999

    Change the leading "%4(msg)" to "%5(msg)" (or %6 to allow > 99999

18c. Add annotations to messages that have been replied to.

    MH provides an annotation facility that will cause new message headers
    to be added to a message when you reply to or forward the message.
    In addition, the default scan.form adds a dash (-) to the scan listing
    for annotated messages so you can see their status in the folder
    table of contents.

    To get annotations you must add to your .mh_profile.

    repl: -annotate

    If you have other profile options for repl, just add -annotate.
    Note: it won't work to abbreviate it as -anno.

18d. Colorize message headers.

    Did you know you can colorize rfc822 headers in the message display
    by setting *m_tagnames and related X resources?  This feature has been
    around for some time, but seems to be little-known.  Here's what I
    have in my ~/.exmh-defaults-color file.

*m_tagnames:    hidden subject from x-filters-matched content-type x-mailer repl
ied replied-to

    m_tagnames lists headers that have display resources associated with them.
    There are two special ones, "hidden" applies to the headers that are
    scrolled off the top of the display.  "general" applies to the ones that
    are visible by default.  The rest are just literal names of headers.

    The display resources are anything that is valid for the Tk text widget
    tag facility.  The most useful ones are font and foreground, but you
    can check out the Tk text widget man page for all the possibilities.
    Here is what I use:

*m_hidden:      -font 6x10
*m_subject:     -foreground blue
*m_x-filters-matched:   -foreground "medium sea green"
*m_content-type:        -foreground "medium sea green"
*m_x-mailer:    -foreground "medium sea green"
*m_from:        -foreground blue
*m_replied:     -foreground "violet red"
