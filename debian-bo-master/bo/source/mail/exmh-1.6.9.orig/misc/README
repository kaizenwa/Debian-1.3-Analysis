README for exmh/misc

Xauthority - some explaination about Xauthority and TK send.
clink.au - the error sound file
drop.au - the new message sound file
emacsclient.README - this has notes on using emacsclient.
    I now think the explanation is more complex than needed.
exmh.setup
    An ancient hack I used to set up folks to use MH for the first time.
    No guarantees about this one.
flist.1
    Man page for the flist program
flist.c
    An MH program to list folders with unseen messages.  This is not
    used by exmh (see instead flist.tcl), but you might find it handy.
    It logically belongs in mh/src/uip
folder.patch
    A patch to mh/src/uip/folder.c that speeds up the -recurse option.
ikon2xbm.c
    Use this like "uncompface | ikon2xbm" to map from a compressed X-face
    to an X bitmap.  This is ideal for the "X-Face command" in the
    Preferences dialog.
maildelivery.template
    An example that goes with exmh.setup
mh_profile.template
    An example that goes with exmh.setup
slocal.patch
    A patch to mh/lib/slocal.c that adds support for the "+" syntax
    that results in a message being piped into rcvstore.
tkCutBuffer.c
    Add this to your wish if you want to define the "cutbuffer" command.
    exmh will use this (but it is optional) to improve your interaction
    with programs like xterm.
tkText.patch
    A patch to tkTextDisplay.c for a wish core dump that exmh is particularly
    good at causing.
