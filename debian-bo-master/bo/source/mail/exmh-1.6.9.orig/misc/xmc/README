XMC(1)                   USER COMMANDS                     XMC(1)



NAME
     xmc - X Mosaic remote-load client

SYNOPSIS
     xmc [ -_D | -_r | -_f <_f_i_l_e> ] <URL>

OPTIONS
     -D   Enable debugging output.

     -r   Reuse flag. If specified, the URL will be loaded in  an
          existing  Mosaic  window.  The default (unspecified) is
          to request Mosaic to open a new window with the URL.

     -f file
          Specifies an alternative xmcrc file.

     <URL>
          The URL to load.


DESCRIPTION
     xmc is intended to be used as a replacement for XMosaic. xmc
     is  analogous to emacsclient(1) for Mosaic.  If the user has
     already started Mosaic, xmc will instruct the running Mosaic
     program  to  display  the  specified  URL.   If no Mosaic is
     presently running, xmc will start one. Xmc has been designed
     to  work  in  a  multi-host environment where Mosaic may not
     have been started on the server that xmc was  invoked  from.
     If  the  Mosaic  isn't  on  the same server as xmc, xmc will
     check the list of hosts  in  /usr/local/lib/mosaic/xmc_hosts
     or the user's .xmcrc to find try and find Mosaic.

     The format of the xmc_hosts and ~/.xmcrc  is  simple.   Each
     line  is  either  a comment (beginning with a #), or line of
     the format:

          _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e [_p_s_c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_p_s_a_r_g_s]]

     If pscommand isn't specified, then the default ps  is  used.
     The  hosts  will be queried in the order specified in by the
     file.


FILES
