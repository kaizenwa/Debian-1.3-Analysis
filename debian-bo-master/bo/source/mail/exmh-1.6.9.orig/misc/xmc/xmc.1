.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xmc
is intended to be used as a replacement for XMosaic. 
.B xmc
is analogous to
.B emacsclient(1)
for Mosaic.  If the user has already started Mosaic, xmc will instruct
the running Mosaic program to display the specified URL.  If no Mosaic
is presently running, xmc will start one. Xmc has been designed to
work in a multi-host environment where Mosaic may not have been
started on the server that xmc was invoked from.  If the Mosaic isn't
on the same server as xmc, xmc will check the list of hosts in
/usr/local/lib/mosaic/xmc_hosts or the user's .xmcrc to find try and
find Mosaic.

The format of the xmc_hosts and ~/.xmcrc is simple.  Each line is either
a comment (beginning with a #), or line of the format:
.IP
.IR hostname " [" pscommand " [" psargs]]
.LP
If pscommand isn't specified, then the default ps is used.  The hosts
will be queried in the order specified in by the file.
