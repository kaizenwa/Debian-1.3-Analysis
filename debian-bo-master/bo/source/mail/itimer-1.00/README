To install:

1. Byte-compile the file itimer.el and install it in a Lisp library
   somewhere in your load-path.

2. You can either compile itimer.c and use that executable or you
   can use the itimer.sh script.  Whichever you choose, install
   the result under the filename `itimer' somwhere in your search
   path.

A simple example of itimer usage appears in the file ntime.el,
which contains a no-frills rewrite of Emacs' time.el.  This is
just an example of how to use the itimer library, it is not needed
to make the itimer code work.
