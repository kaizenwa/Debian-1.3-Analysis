To use itimer with vm, check out the documentation for vm's
vm-auto-get-new-mail variable:

  *Non-nil value causes VM to automatically move mail from spool files
  to a mail folder when the folder is first visited.  Nil means you
  must always use vm-get-new-mail to pull in newly arrived messages.
  
  If the value is a number, then it specifies how often (in seconds)
  VM should check for new mail and try to retrieve it.  This is done
  asynchronously and may occur while you are editing other files.  It
  should not disturb your editing, except perhaps for a pause while
  the work is being done.  The `itimer' package must be installed for
  this to work.  Otherwise a numeric value is the same as a value of
  t.

...so to e.g. check for new mail every 20 seconds, add this to your
.emacs:

  (setq vm-auto-get-new-mail 20)
