.SH NAME
popauth - manipulate POP authorization DB
.SH SYNOPSIS
popauth
\%[\-init] \%[\-list] \%[\-delete\ name] \%[\-user\ name]
\%[\-help]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIpopauth\fR program allows a POP-subscriber to change the secret
value used to generate their authentication credentials.
In addition,
the super\-user or master POP user may use this program to either
add or remove a user, or to print public information from it.  Only the
super\-user may initialize the database.  \fIpopauth\fR is useful only when
the APOP configuration option is defined.  (This configuration option defines
the name of the POP authorization DB.)

Under normal usage,
\fIpopauth\fR prompts for a new secret,
just like the \fIpasswd\fR program.
It then updates the POP authorization DB accordingly.

With the `\-init' switch,
the super-user can create a new (or zero the existing) POP authorization DB.

With the `\-list' switch,
the super-user or master POP user can print out public information
about the named subscriber (or all subscribers).

With the `\-delete' switch, the super-user or master POP user can remove
a user entry from the authorization DB.
