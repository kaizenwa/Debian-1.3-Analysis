	This popper has been modified by many people.  Read the
    Release.Notes document in the doc directory for a complete
    history.  This popper can be anonymously retrieved from
    ftp.qualcomm.com under /quest/unix/servers/popper.

	The INSTALL file describes the simplified make and install
    procedure for the Qualcomm popper.

	The README.Berkeley goes into much more detail on how to
    install the popper if you are interested.

	Basically you enter "make" to view a list of ported platforms
    and then you enter "make <target>" for the OS that comes closest
    to what you want.
