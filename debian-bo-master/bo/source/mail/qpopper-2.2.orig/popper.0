     _P_o_p_p_e_r is an implementation  of  the  Post  Office  Protocol
     server  that  runs  on a variety of Unix computers to manage
     electronic mail for Macintosh  and  MS-DOS  computers.   The
     server  was  developed  at  the  University of California at
     Berkeley and conforms fully to  the  specifications  in  RFC
     1081 and RFC 1082.

     The ----dddd flag sets the socket to debugging and turns on debug-
     ging.   All  debugging information is saved using syslog(8).
     The ----tttt ttttrrrraaaacccceeee----ffffiiiilllleeee flag turns  on  debugging  and  saves  the
     trace information in _t_r_a_c_e-_f_i_l_e using fprintf(3V).

     The ----ssss flag turns on statistics logging using syslog(8).  At
     the end of each popper session, the following information is
     logged: username, number  of  messages  deleted,  number  of
     bytes  deleted,  number of message left on server, number of
     bytes left on server.

     The ----TTTT ttttiiiimmmmeeeeoooouuuutttt option changes  the  default  compiled  value
     POP_TIMEOUT  for  terminating  a  session with a pop client.
     When the server is waiting for a command to arrive from  the
     client,  it  times out after the specified number of seconds
     and terminates  the  session.   This  avoids  having  popper
     processes  hang  forever  waiting  for  command  input  from
     clients which have terminated abnormally.  A small value  is
     ok  for  small  to  medium  nets  where the network delay is
     within a few seconds.  In this case  15-30  seconds  is  not
     unreasonable.  Networks with large delays in sending packets
     (e.g., SLIP links) may require a larger value.  In this case
     300 seconds (5 minutes) is not unreasonable.

     The ----bbbb bbbbuuuullllllllddddiiiirrrr option turns  on  the  bulletin  feature  and
     specifies the bulletin directory path.

     The bulletin feature gives system administrators  a  way  to
     send important announcements to all POP users without having
     to do mass mailings.

     The bulletin directory contains one file per bulletin.  Each
     file  contains a single mail message with header and body in
     mailbox format. The first line of each such bulletin must be
     a "From " line. The easiest way for sysadmins to create such
     bulletins is to mail themselves a copy of the bulletin using

     the  account to which they want replies to be sent, then use
     their mail program to save the message to a file in the bul-
     letin  directory  in  mailbox format. The bulletin directory
     must be world readable.

     The name of each bulletin  file  begins  with  the  bulletin
     number,  and  may optionally continue with any other charac-
     ters. E.g., the file name of bulletin  number  23  might  be
     "23.pophost_down_sunday".

     Popper creates a file named .popbull in the  home  directory
     of each user. This file contains a single line recording the
     highest numbered bulletin received by the user.

     Each time a POP client connects to the server, any new  bul-
     letins  which  the  user  has  not  received  previously are
     automatically appended to the user's mail.

     When a bulletin is copied, the "To" header line is  replaced
     by  "To:  username@thishost", and any "Status:" header lines
     are deleted. Otherwise, the bulletin is copied as is.

     When a new user checks  for  mail  the  first  time,  popper
     creates  the  .popbull file in the user's home directory and
     seeds it with the current maximum bulletin number. Thus  new
     users do not get old bulletins.

     The Berkeley POP server is a single program (called  popper)
     that  is launched by inetd when it gets a service request on
     the POP TCP port.  (The official port  number  specified  in
     RFC  1081 for POP version 3 is port 110.  However, some POP3
     clients attempt to contact the server at port 109,  the  POP
     version  2  port.  Unless you are running both POP2 and POP3
     servers, you can simply define both ports  for  use  by  the
     POP3 server.  This is explained in the installation instruc-
     tions later on.)  The popper program initializes  and  veri-
     fies  that  the  peer  IP address is registered in the local
     domain, logging a warning message when a connection is  made
     to a client whose IP address does not have a canonical name.
     For systems using BSD 4.3 bind, it also checks to see  if  a
     cannonical  name lookup for the client returns the same peer
     IP address, logging a warning message if it does  not.   The
     the  server enters the authorization state, during which the
     client must correctly identify itself by providing  a  valid
     Unix  userid  and password on the server's host machine.  No
     other exchanges are allowed during this state (other than  a
     request  to  quit.)  If authentication fails, a warning mes-
     sage is logged and the session ends.  Once the user is iden-
     tified,  popper changes its user and group ids to match that
     of the user and enters the transaction  state.   The  server
     makes  a temporary copy of the user's maildrop which is used

     for all subsequent transactions.  These include the bulk  of
     POP  commands  to retrieve mail, delete mail, undelete mail,
     and so forth.  When the client quits, the server enters  the
     final  update  state  during which the network connection is
     terminated and the user's maildrop is updated with the (pos-
     sibly) modified temporary maildrop.

     The POP server uses syslog to keep a record of  its  activi-
     ties.   On  systems with BSD 4.3 syslogging, the server logs
     (by default) to the "local0" facility at  priority  "notice"
     for  all messages except debugging which is logged at prior-
     ity    "debug".      The     default     log     file     is
     /usr/spool/mqueue/POPlog.  These can be changed, if desired.
     On systems with 4.2 syslogging all messages  are  logged  to
     the local log file, usually /usr/spool/mqueue/syslog.

     The popper program will log debugging information  when  the
     -d  parameter  is  specified  after  its  invocation  in the
     inetd.conf file.  Care should be  exercised  in  using  this
     option  since it generates considerable output in the syslog
     file.  Alternatively, the "-t <file-name>" option will place
     debugging  information into file "<file-name>" using fprintf
     instead of syslog.

     For SunOS version 3.5, the popper  program  is  launched  by
     inetd  from  /etc/servers.   This file does not allow you to
     specify command line arguments.  Therefore, if you  want  to
     enable   debugging,  you  can  specify  a  shell  script  in
     /etc/servers to be launched instead of popper  and  in  this
     script call popper with the desired arguments.

     You can confirm that the POP server is running  on  Unix  by
     telneting  to  port  110 (or 109 if you set it up that way).
     For example:

     %telnet myhost 110
     Trying...
     Connected to myhost.berkeley.edu.
     Escape character is '^]'.
     +OK UCB Pop server (version 1.6) at myhost starting.
     quit
     Connection closed by foreign host.
