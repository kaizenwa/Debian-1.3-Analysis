.SH NAME
popper \- pop 3 server

[ -s ]

[ -T timeout]
[ -b bulldir]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Popper
is an implementation of the Post Office Protocol server that runs on a
variety of Unix computers to manage electronic mail for Macintosh
and MS-DOS computers.  The server was developed at the University of
California at Berkeley and conforms fully to the specifications in RFC
1081 and RFC 1082.
.PP
The 
.B \-d
flag sets the socket to debugging and turns on debugging.  All debugging
information is saved using syslog(8).  The 
.B \-t trace\-file
flag turns on debugging and saves the trace information in
.I trace\-file
using fprintf(3V).
.PP
The
.B \-k
flag enables kerberos authentication when popper has been compiled with
the KERBEROS define.  You must already have libraries that support Kerberos.
.PP
The
.B \-s
flag turns on statistics logging using syslog(8). At the end of each popper
session, the following information is logged: username, number of 
messages deleted, number of bytes deleted, number of message left on server,
number of bytes left on server.
.PP
The
.B \-T timeout
option changes the default compiled value POP_TIMEOUT for terminating a 
session with a pop client.  
When the server is waiting for a command to arrive from the client, it
times out after the specified number of seconds and terminates the session.
This avoids having popper processes hang forever waiting for command input
from clients which have terminated abnormally.
A small value is ok for small to medium nets where
the network delay is within a few seconds.  In this case 15-30 seconds is
not unreasonable.  Networks with large delays in sending packets (e.g., SLIP 
links) may require a larger value.  In this case 300 seconds (5 minutes) is not
unreasonable.  
.PP
The
.B \-b bulldir
option turns on the bulletin feature and specifies the bulletin directory path.
.SH BULLETINS
.PP
The bulletin feature gives system administrators a way to send important
announcements to all POP users without having to do mass mailings.
.PP
The bulletin directory contains one file per bulletin. Each file 
contains a single mail message with header and body in 
mailbox format. The first line of each such bulletin must be a "From " line. 
The easiest way for sysadmins to create such bulletins is to mail themselves 
a copy of the bulletin using the account to which they want replies to be sent,
then use their mail program to save the message to a file in the bulletin 
directory in mailbox format. The bulletin directory must be world readable.
.PP
The name of each bulletin file begins with the bulletin number, and may 
optionally continue with any other characters. E.g., the file name of 
bulletin number 23 might be "23.pophost_down_sunday".
.PP
Popper creates a file named .popbull 
in the home directory of each user. 
This file contains a single line recording the highest numbered bulletin 
received by the user. 
.PP
Each time a POP client connects to the server, any new bulletins which 
the user has not received previously are automatically appended to the
user's mail.
.PP
When a bulletin is copied, the "To" header line 
is replaced by "To: username@thishost", and any "Status:" header lines are 
deleted. Otherwise, the bulletin is copied as is.
.PP
When a new user checks for mail the first time, popper creates the .popbull 
file in the user's home directory and seeds it with the current maximum 
bulletin number. Thus new users do not get old bulletins.
.SH THE POP TRANSACTION CYCLE
.PP
The Berkeley POP server is a single program (called popper) that is
launched by inetd when it gets a service request on the POP TCP port.
(The official port number specified in RFC 1081 for POP version 3 is
port 110.  However, some POP3 clients attempt to contact the server at
port 109, the POP version 2 port.  Unless you are running both POP2 and
POP3 servers, you can simply define both ports for use by the POP3
server.  This is explained in the installation instructions later on.)
The popper program initializes and verifies that the peer IP address is
registered in the local domain, logging a warning message when a
connection is made to a client whose IP address does not have a
canonical name.  For systems using BSD 4.3 bind, it also checks to see
if a cannonical name lookup for the client returns the same peer IP
address, logging a warning message if it does not.  The the server
enters the authorization state, during which the client must correctly
identify itself by providing a valid Unix userid and password on the
server's host machine.  No other exchanges are allowed during this
state (other than a request to quit.)  If authentication fails, a
warning message is logged and the session ends.  Once the user is
identified, popper changes its user and group ids to match that of the
user and enters the transaction state.  The server makes a temporary
copy of the user's maildrop which is
used for all subsequent transactions.  These include the bulk of POP
commands to retrieve mail, delete mail, undelete mail, and so forth.
When the client quits, the server enters the final update state during which
the network connection is terminated and the user's maildrop is updated
with the (possibly) modified temporary maildrop.
.SH LOGGING
.PP
The POP server uses syslog to keep a record of its activities.  On
systems with BSD 4.3 syslogging, the server logs (by default) to the
"local0" facility at priority "notice" for all messages except
debugging which is logged at priority "debug".  The default log file is
/usr/spool/mqueue/POPlog.  These can be changed, if desired.  On
systems with 4.2 syslogging all messages are logged to the local log
file, usually /usr/spool/mqueue/syslog.
.SH DEBUGGING
.PP
The popper program will log debugging information when the -d parameter
is specified after its invocation in the inetd.conf file.  Care should
be exercised in using this option since it generates considerable
output in the syslog file.  Alternatively, the "-t <file-name>" option
will place debugging information into file "<file-name>" using fprintf
instead of syslog.
.PP
For SunOS version 3.5, the popper program is launched by inetd from
/etc/servers.  This file does not allow you to specify command line
arguments.  Therefore, if you want to enable debugging, you can specify
a shell script in /etc/servers to be launched instead of popper and in
this script call popper with the desired arguments.
.PP
You can confirm that the POP server is running on Unix by telneting to
port 110 (or 109 if you set it up that way).  For example:
.PP
.nf
%telnet myhost 110
Trying...
Connected to myhost.berkeley.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK UCB Pop server (version 1.6) at myhost starting.
quit
Connection closed by foreign host.
.fi
.SH EXTENSIONS
.PP
The server implements two extended commands.
.PP
XTND XMIT: Sends a mail message using /usr/lib/sendmail.
.PP
XTND XLIST header [num]: Extracts and returns the specified header line
for the specified message number. If the "num" parameter is missing, 
returns the header line for all the messages which are not currently
marked for deletion.
