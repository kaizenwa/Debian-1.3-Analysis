This is a snapshot of development sources of the IMAP4 version of the
IMAP toolkit.  It is updated frequently.

This version supports the RFC-1730 version of IMAP4.

Until the dust settles, I'm not keeping any revision histories.  I
plan on starting an RCS revision history after the IMAP4rev1 updates
are made.

This suggests that you shouldn't spend too much time working on your
own custom changes, otherwise, you'll have a devil's time keeping
merged.  Rather, you should concentrate on getting your mail program
to use the new interfaces.

The following are known problems/deficiencies:
 . No local file drivers for Mac, TOPS-20, or VMS.
 . OS/2 port isn't finished
 . search CHARSETs other than US-ASCII are not yet supported.
 . AUTHENTICATE command in IMAP server doesn't have any protection
    mechanisms yet.
 . Only Kerberos client support is there yet.
 . Sticky UIDs are not supported in the mh, mtx, or tenex drivers.
 . POP3 UIDs are only supported in the server, not in the client.
 . Only the mbx and mx drivers support creation of keywords.
 . No support for TCP open timeouts on Winsock, generic DOS, and VMS Multinet.
 . No support for any TCP timeouts on Waterloo DOS, TOPS-20, and VMS Netlib.
