			WN -- a server for HTTP
		Version 1.16.0  now available at
		ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/wn/wn-1.16.0.tar.gz


WN is an HTTP server that runs on most common UNIX platforms and is
available at no cost for any use under the terms of the GNU public
license.  There is extensive documentation available.  The primary
design goal of WN is security.

WN is especially well suited for servers that must also perform 
other tasks.  Both a standalone daemon and a version intended for
use under inetd are provided.  The inetd version is designed to 
minimize the use of system resources and it is appropriate for
moderate or lightly loaded servers which cannot be totally dedicated
to Web serving.

The design of WN emphasizes security and functionality.  It is based
on the use of a small flat database in each directory with information
about the files in that directory.  Fields associated with a file
include its title, and may include keywords, expiration date and any
user defined fields like author or document id.

WN's functionality was planned with a focus on serving HTML documents.
This means such things as enabling full text searching of a single
logical HTML document which may consist of many files on the server,
or allowing users users to search all titles on the server and obtain
a menu of matching items, or allowing users to download a total
logical document for printing even though the document consists of
many linked files on the server.  All of these are done in a way which
is transparent to the user (and largely transparent to the maintainer!)
The User's Guide at <URL:http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/manual.html>
provides a good example of both of these. But these are only examples of 
many new tools WN makes available to webmasters.
