<h2>How the Index to the User's Guide works</h2>

The file docindex.html was produced by the <i>WN</i> utility
<a href="utility.html#indexmaker">indexmaker.</a> Indexmaker produces a
collection of HTML unordered lists with entries like

<blockquote>
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="search=context?content-type"&gt;content-type&lt;/a&gt;
</blockquote> <p>

This is an anchor to a relative URL.  The complete URL would be

<blockquote>
     http://host/docs/search=context?content-type
</blockquote>

which asks the server to do a <a href="search.html#context>context
search</a> of the 15 files in the User's Guide with query term
"content-type".  When this is selected the server returns a list of
all files in the directory with matches, with a sublist for each list
consisting of the lines that contain a match.  Selecting one of the
highlighted search terms in a match line causes the server to return
document positioned at the location of the matched item.  This is part
of all context searches.  It is done by inserting an anchor on the fly
at the location of the match.
