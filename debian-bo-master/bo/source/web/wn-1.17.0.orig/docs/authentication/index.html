<h2>A password protected directory</h2>

This file is accessible only to user <i>santa</i> with password
<i>red-nosed</i> or user <i>rudolph</i> with password <i>NorthPole</i>
<p>

Here is what the <i>index</i> file for this directory looks like
<blockquote>
    Authorization-realm=myrealm@hopf.math.nwu.edu<br>
    Authorization-module=~/bin/authwn -D wnpasswd<br>
    Authorization-type=basic<br>
<br>
    File=index.html<br>
</blockquote>
<p>

The realm lets the client know that the same user/password pair is
valid for any other directory with the same realm. The
Authorization-module line specifies that we are using the module
<i>authwn</i> which comes as part of the <i>WN</i> package.  The -D
option indicates that we are using a DBM data base for storing user names
and passwords.  (A simple password file can also be used).
The <i>wnpasswd</i> argument is the name of the password file (actually
in this case since we are using DBM, the password data base consists of
two files: wnpasswd.dir and wnpasswd.pag).
<p>

You can look at the User's Guide <a href="../access.html#authenticate">
section on authentication.</a>
