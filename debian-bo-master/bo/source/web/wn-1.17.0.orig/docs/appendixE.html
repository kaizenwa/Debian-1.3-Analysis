<h2 align="center">Appendix E: Creating a Homepage -- a Document for Users</h2>
<hr size="4">


This document is for the ordinary user, not the system "webmaster".
It is intended as a short
description of how to use the WN Web server to set up your home page
(and related documents if you wish).  It is not a primer on writing
HTML, there are many of those -- some are listed below.  Instead it
deals with what to do with a homepage document after it is created to
put it "on the Web."  We assume that your system administrator has
already set up the WN server in such a way that users are permitted to
have homepages in their own directories.  If that isn't the case you
will have to persuade your local administrator to do so or read the
full <a href="manual.html">WN User's Guide</a> to learn how to do it
yourself.
<p>

But let's be optimistic and suppose everything is set up and
working properly.  If you haven't created a home page here is
a bare bones one you can copy to expand on later:
<blockquote>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;title&gt;John Doe's Homepage&lt;/title&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;h1&gt;John Doe's Homepage&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
<br>
This is the story of my life and manifold accomplishments...<br>
<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>

[<b>Note:</b> To find out more about composing HTML documents consult <a
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html"> A Beginner's
Guide to HTML</a> (at
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html) or see <a
href="http://home.netscape.com/home/how-to-create-web-services.html">
Creating Net Sites</a> (at
http://home.netscape.com/home/how-to-create-web-services.html).] <p>

Your home page and any other files you want to serve must be
located in a particular subdirectory of your home directory
(your home directory is where you are when you first login) on
the UNIX system which is running the WN server.  Usually this
subdirectory is called <i>public_html</i>,  but your system
webmaster may have chosen something different.  We'll assume
the name is public_html.
<p>

It probably doesn't yet exist in your home directory. If not
create it with the command
<blockquote>
     mkdir public_html&lt;ret&gt;
</blockquote>
<p>

The public_html directory also must have the correct "permissions"
so that the server can look inside it.  For security reasons the
WN server isn't very powerful and it can only access files and
directories which are not heavily protected.  Just to make sure
the server won't have trouble accessing your homepage run the
command
<blockquote>
     chmod 755 public_html&lt;ret&gt;
</blockquote>
<p>

You must place a copy of your homepage in this directory and
give it the name <i>index.html.</i>  One way to do this is
enter the public_html directory and use an editor to create the homepage
file there with the name index.html.  Alternatively, you could
create it elsewhere and copy it to the public_html directory.
If you need to rename it the proper UNIX command is "mv oldname newname".
<p>

Of course the server must also be able to read your homepage in order
to serve it.  If documents you create are automatically protected from
viewing by others you will have to change that for your homepage.  The
command
<blockquote>
     chmod 644 index.html&lt;ret&gt;
</blockquote>
gives anyone (including the server) permission to read but not
change your homepage.
<p>

There is one more step before your homepage is available to the world.
The WN server is very security conscious.  It is much more careful about
refusing to serve documents which users did not intend to be served.
This means that in addition to serving only documents in designated
directories (such as your "public_html") it will only serve documents
which have been explicitly designated for serving in some way.

Here are two different ways to grant the server permission to serve
your homepage.  You only need to do one of these.
<p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>A Lazy Way</b>
  <dd>
       Create a file in the <b>public_html</b> directory named <b>index</b>
       which contains the line
       <blockquote>
           Attribute=serveall
       </blockquote>
       Then execute the command
       <blockquote>
           wndex
       </blockquote>

       which will create the file "index.cache".
       It grants the server permission to serve anything
       in this directory.  If you put documents to be
       served in subdirectories of public_html, copy the file index to them
       also and rerun wndex in these subdirectories to grant permission
       to serve anything from them (actually the file "index" itself
       is excluded from being served as are files beginning with the '.'
       character).
       <p>

  <dt><b>A Better Way</b>
  <dd>
       Create a file in the <b>public_html</b> directory named <b>index</b>
       which contains the line
       <blockquote>
           File=index.html
       </blockquote>
       If you have other files you want to serve add additional lines
       like "File=foo.html" where foo.html is the name of the file
       you want to serve. Then execute the command
       <blockquote>
           wndex
       </blockquote>
       Files which are HTML files should have names which end with
       the suffix ".html".  Files which are ASCII text files should
       end with ".txt" and GIF image files should end with ".gif".
       Executing the "wndex" (pronounced "windex") command will
       create the file "index.cache" as before, but now the server
       will only have permission to serve those files whose names
       are listed explicitly in your index file.
       <p>
       If you put documents to be
       served in subdirectories of public_html, you must create an index
       file in each of them also which lists the files which can be
       served.
       <p>
</dl>

The "better way", in addition to providing better security, also enables
many of the advanced features of the WN server, such as searching
capabilities.  In the long run if you serve multiple documents
you will probably want to use it.  The trade off is that the "lazy"
way is easier since it only needs to be done once, while the "better"
way requires that you edit the index file and rerun "wndex" each
time you add a new file to public_html to be served.
<p>

<h2>What's your URL?</h2>
So once your homepage is functional, how do you access it?  Well, your
webpage address (called a URL which stands for "Uniform Resource Locator")
is made up from the name of your host and your user name.  For example,
if your user name is jdoe and the computer on which the server is
running is named www.school.edu then the URL for your homepage is
probably
<blockquote>
     http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/
</blockquote>

The "probably" refers to the fact that there are many possible variations
which may have been chosen by your webmaster.  For example, some people
don't like the '~' character in URL's so they might use
http://www.school.edu/homepages/jdoe/.  In any case there are a couple
of things to notice about your URL.
<p>

First it has a synonym
<blockquote>
     http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/index.html
</blockquote>
This is because whenever a URL ends in '/' the server knows it is referring
to a directory (in this case your public_html directory) and looks for
the default file "index.html" in that directory.  Thus if you want to
put some files in subdirectories of public_html that is fine.  But
keep in mind that if you create the directory "mydir" in public_html
then <i>http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/mydir/</i> will really refer to
<i>http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/mydir/index.html</i> and to refer to a file
"foo.gif" in mydir you should use
<i>http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/mydir/foo.gif</i>.  You should not use the
URL  <i>http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/mydir</i> referring to a directory but
with no '/' at the end.
<p>

<h2>Advanced Features</h2>
There are many advanced features you can use with the WN server.
To learn to use them you will need to read parts of the manual designed
for system administrators.  A good place to start is the
<a href="overview.html">overview chapter</a> of this manual.  It will
give you a good idea of some of the things the server can do.  Then you
will likely also want to consult the <a href="index_desc.html">
chapter on index files.</a> Neither of these chapters is too long.
