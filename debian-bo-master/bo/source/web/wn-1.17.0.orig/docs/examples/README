To use the image clicking capabilities involving "imagemap" you
must get this program from NCSA and compile it.  Instructions for
setting it up are at 

http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/admin/Imagemap.html

The compiled C program must be renamed imagemap.cgi (or at least
something with a suffix .cgi)
