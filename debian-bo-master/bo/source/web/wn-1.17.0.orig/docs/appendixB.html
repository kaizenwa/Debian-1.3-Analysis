<h2 align="center">Appendix B:  Index File directives</h2>
<hr size="4">

This is a list of the items which may be placed in an index file to be
processed by <i>wndex.</i> This file consists of a collection of
<i>records</i> each of which consists of a group of lines pertaining
to single file.  Each line of a record begins with a <i>directive</i>
like "Title=" which indicates that the remainder of that line is to be
take as the title of the document whose record contains this line.
The "File=" directive is special in that it indicates the beginning of
a new record.  The value of the "File=" directive is the name of the
file whose record will follow.  Lettercase is not significant in
directive keywords. <p>

When the character '#' is encountered in an index file it is assumed
to be the start of a comment and everything after it on that line is
ignored.  To include the '#' character in, for example, a document
title, it must be escaped with the '\' character.  I.e. when "\#" is
encountered it does not signify a comment and the character '#'
(without the backslash) is treated as a normal character.  In fact,
since all directives contain the character '=', all lines which do not
contain this character are silently ignored.  Also a single conceptual
line of an index file can be spread over several actual lines by
ending all but the last line with the '\' character.  I.e. if a line
ends with '\' that character is removed and the contents of the next
line is considered a continuation of the current line.  The maximum
total length of a line (including continuation) is 4096 characters.
<p>

The first record in an index file is special and is intended
to describe attributes of the entire directory rather than individual
files.  It contains lines with directives specifying attributes
of the directory as a whole or all the files in it.  Here is a
complete list of these directory directives:
<p>

<h3><a name="dirdirective">Directory directives</a></h3>
<dl>

<dt> <b><a name = "accessfile">Accessfile</a></b> -- Specify directory 
     access control file
<dd> 
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Accessfile=/dir/accessfile
     </blockquote>
     specifies that the file /dir/accessfile is to be used to
     determine access priviliges (by hostname or IP address) for
     this directory.  If this line is omitted access is allowed
     for everyone.  Both the path /dir/accessfile  and the
     path ~/dir/accessfile are taken relative to the WN root directory.
     In particular the accessfile must be in the WN hierarchy (unlike
     includes or filters, for example.) If the path does not begin with a
     '/' or a '~' then it is relative to the directory containing
     the index file.  (See the user's manual section:
     <a href="access.html">Limiting Access to Your WN Hierarchy.</a>)
     <p>
     
<dt> <b><a name = "accessdenied">Access-denied-URL</a></b> -- Set a
     substitute URL for requests for which access is denied due to
     an <a href="#accessfile">accessfile</a> restriction.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Access-denied-URL=http://host/dir/foo.html
     </blockquote>

     or the line
     <blockquote>
     Access-denied-URL=/dir/foo.html
     </blockquote>
     specifies that any request for a document in this directory which
     is denied because of an accessfile restriction 
     should be redirected to the given URL.  A default value for all
     directories can be set by uncommenting the "#define ACCESS_DENIED_URL"
     line in config.h and recompiling.   If you use this
     directive be sure that the file foo.html does not have restricted
     access or you can create an infinite loop.  This line has the 
     special feature that it can also be placed as the first line of the
     <a href="#accessfile">accessfile</a> controlling the directory.
     A line in the accessfile will override any value set in the index file.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="dattributes">Attributes</a></b> -- Set directory attributes
<dd>
     Currently there are only two directory attributes, viz. "nosearch"
     and "serveall."  Lettercase is not signficant in the attribute value.
     <p>

     The line
     <blockquote>
     Attributes=serveall
     </blockquote>
     specifies that any file, with a few exceptions,
     in this directory may be served
     not just those listed in the <i>index</i> file.  The server will
     attempt to set the content type correctly based on the file name suffix
     using the same default correspondences between type and suffix
     that <i>wndex</i> uses.  The exceptions are that files whose name
     starts with '.' or ends with '~' as well as the files "index" and
     "index.cache" will not be served.
     <p>

     The line
     <blockquote>
     Attributes=nosearch
     </blockquote>
     specifies that the index.cache databases in the current directory
     and its subdirectories should not be searched  when the server does
     a title, keyword or user defined field search.  Likewise context and
     grep searches will not be allowed in this directory.  In this case
     when an attempt is made to do so an error message is returned to the
     client.  It is also possible to exclude only some files from searching
     with the <a href="#attributes">Attributes= file directive.</a>
     <p>

<dt> <b>Authorization-Module, Authorization-Realm, Authorization-Type</b> --
     Specify program to be used as for authorization module.
<dd>
     Currently <i>WN</i> includes a "basic" authorization module called
     <i>authwn.</i>  Its use is described in the chapter on
     <a href="access.html#authenticate">limiting access</a> to your server.
     Alternatively you can make your own module to handle authorization.
     Data is placed in environment variables as with CGI.  <i>WN</i> expects
     this module to exit with status 0 if authorization is granted
     and with status 1 if access is  denied.
     <p>

     For security reasons when you use an Authorization-Module you
     are required to use either the <a href="appendixA.html#t_opt">
     -t or  -T option</a> or the <a href="appendixA.html#a_opt">
     -a or  -A option</a>and to have the index.cache file in the protected
     directory owned by the trusted user or group.  This is to guard
     against counterfeit authorization modules.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name = "authdenied">Auth-denied-file</a></b> -- Specify
     the name of an HTML file  to be used as the error message when
     an authentication attempt for a password protected directory fails.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Auth-denied-file=~/dir/foo.html
     </blockquote>
     specifies that any request for a document in this directory which
     is denied because of an authorization module restriction results
     in the file ~/dir/foo.html being sent instead.  A default value for all
     directories can be set by uncommenting the "#define AUTH_DENIED_FILE"
     line in config.h and recompiling.  Note that this is not a URL but
     the name of a file whose content is to be sent as error text when
     authentication is denied.  If the file name starts with '~/' as above
     it is assumed to be relative to the WN root directory.  
     Otherwise it is assumed to be a path relative to the directory
     containing the index file.  
     <p>

<dt> <b>Cache-Module</b> -- Specify program to be used as 
     interface to database for index.cache entries.
<dd>
     If this line specifies a program then instead of looking for file
     entries in the index.cache file this program is executed after putting
     the basename of the URL in the environment variable WN_KEY.  This
     provides a mechanism to use a real database rather than the file
     index.cache.  Note that the directory directives are still obtained
     from index.cache.  The output of this module must be in the format
     of an index.cache line.  Title, cache and grep searches are not
     supported since that would require reading the entire database.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="defatt">Default-Attributes</a></b> -- Specify the
     default <a href="#attributes">attributes record</a> for items
     in this directory.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Default-Attributes=parse,dynamic
     </blockquote>
     specifies that files in this directory should be parsed 
     and marked as dynamic documents (not to be cached) unless
     they have an attributes record specifying the contrary.
     <p>


<dt> <b><a name="defcon">Default-Content</a></b> -- Specify the
     default MIME content type for items in this directory.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Default-content=text/html
     </blockquote>
     specifies that files in this directory which do not end in a suffix
     recognizable to wndex should be given the type "text/html".  Any
     legitimate MIME type may be used as the value.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="defdoc">Default-Document</a></b> -- Specify the
     default document for this directory.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Default-Document=foo.html
     </blockquote>
     specifies that a URL pointing to this directory like
     "http://host/dir/"  will result in serving the document
     /WN_root/dir/foo.html instead of /WN_root/dir/index.html.
     Uses of this include making the default document a CGI script
     with "Default-Document=foo.cgi" or having a directory with
     HTML files all ending with the suffix ".htm" and using the
     directive "Default-Document=foo.htm".  This directive applies
     only to the directory containing the index file, not to any
     subdirectories.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="defincludes">Default-Includes</a></b> -- Specify a
     default includes line for documents in this directory.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Default-Includes=footer.html
     </blockquote>
     specifies that this line should be used as the 
     <a href="#includes">Includes=</a> directive for any
     document in this directory which does not have an Includes=
     directive explicitly set.  To override this default value
     simply specify an explicit Includes= directive or use
     Includes=<none> to have none.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="defmaxage">Default-Max-Age</a></b> -- Specify the
     default Max-Age for this directory.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Default-Max-Age=2 weeks
     </blockquote>
     specifies the Cache-Control and Expires headers of all
     documents served from this directory should be set to 
     expire the document 2 weeks after it is served.
     <p>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Default-Max-Age=2 weeks
     </blockquote>
     specifies the Cache-Control and Expires headers of all
     documents served from this directory should be set to 
     expire the document 2 weeks after the last-modified date of the
     document. For more details see the
     <a href="#maxage">Max-Age directive.</a>
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="defwrapper">Default-Wrappers</a></b> -- Specify a
     default Wrappers= directive for documents in this directory.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Default-Wrappers=wrapper.html
     </blockquote>
     specifies that this line should be used as the 
     <a href="#wrappers">Wrappers=</a> directive for any
     document in this directory which does not have a Wrappers=
     directive explicitly set.  To override this default value
     simply specify an explicit Wrappers= directive or use
     Wrappers=<none> to have none.
     <p>

<dt> <b>File-Module</b> -- Specify program to be used as 
     interface to database for obtaining files.
<dd>
     If this line specifies a program then instead of looking for a file
     in the current directory this program is executed after putting
     the basename of the URL in the environment variable WN_KEY.  The
     output of this is served as if it were a file. This
     provides a mechanism to use a real database rather than the file
     index.cache.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name = "dnomatch">Nomatchsub</a></b> -- Set substitute file
     for searches on this directory which result in no matches.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Nomatchsub=foo.html
     </blockquote>
     specifies that the HTML file foo.html in the current directory
     should be used for the output of all searches (title, keyword, context,
     grep, etc.) on this directory which return no matches.  It can
     only be used in conjunction with the <a href="#dwrapper">Searchwrapper</a>
     directive.  See also  <a href="#fnomatch">Nomatchsub for files.</a>
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name = "nosuch">No-Such-File-URL</a></b> -- Set substitute URL
     for requests for non-existent files
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     No-Such-File-URL=http://host/dir/foo.html
     </blockquote>

     or the line
     <blockquote>
     No-Such-File-URL=/dir/foo.html
     </blockquote>
     specifies that any request in this directory for a non-existent file
     should be redirected to the given URL.  A default value for all
     directories and non-existent directories can be set by 
     uncommenting the "#define NO_SUCH_FILE_URL"
     line in config.h and recompiling.  The value set here will also 
     be used if an index.cache file does not exist.  If you use this
     directive be sure that the file foo.html <b>does exist</b> or you
     can create an infinite loop.
     <p>

<dt> <b>Owner</b> -- Specify owner of directory items
<dd>
     This should be a line like
     <blockquote>
     Owner=mailto:maintainer@host
     </blockquote>
     The mailto:e-mail_address may be replaced with a URL referring
     to the indvidual who is responsible for the documents in this
     directory.  This information is used in an HTTP header.  It is
     not possible to designate the owner of a single file in an
     index directive.  However, if the file is an HTML file this can
     be done with a "link" tag in the header of that document.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="dwrapper">Searchwrapper</a></b> -- Set wrapper file for searches on this directory.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Searchwrapper=swrap.html
     </blockquote>
     specifies that the HTML file swrap.html in the current directory
     should be used as a wrapper for the output of all searches on this
     directory.
     <p>

<dt> <b>Subdirs</b> -- Specify subdirectories for searching and
     recursive use of wndex
<dd>
     When you run the <a href="index_desc.html#wndex">wndex</a> utility
     with the -r option (for recursive), it must know in which subdirectories
     it should descend to create a new index.cache database file.
     Likewise when the server does a title, keyword or user defined field
     search, it recursively descends the data hierarchy and must know for
     each directory which subdirectories are part of the hierarchy.

     The maintainer provides this information in a line like
     <blockquote>
     Subdirs=subdir1,subdir2,subdir3
     </blockquote>

     in the directory directives giving a comma separated list of
     subdirectories of the directory containing the current index file.
     <p>


</dl>
     
<h3><a name="filedirective">File directives</a></h3>

A collection of lines in the index file containing information about
a single file in the directory of the index file is called a file
record.  A new file record begins with a line starting with <i>File=</i>
and ends with the start of a new file record.
Each line in a record begins with a
<i>file directive.</i>  Here is the complete list:

<dl>
<dt> <b><a name="attributes">Attributes</a></b> -- Set file attributes
<dd>
     Currently several possible attributes are possible including
      nosearch, parse, noparse, dynamic and cgi.  Multiple values,
     separated by commas can be put on a single 
     Attributes line, as in "Attributes=parse, dynamic, nosearch".
     Lettercase is not significant in the attribute value.  Also
     "Attribute=" (without the 's') is synonymous with "Attributes=".
     <p>

     The line
     <blockquote>
     Attributes=parse
     </blockquote>
     indicates that the file referenced by this directive should be parsed
     for conditional text or server-side includes.  This line is not necessary
     if there is also a Wrappers= line or an Includes= line since in that
     case the parse attribute is assumed.  If you do not wish a document
     to be parsed when it otherwise would be the Attribute=noparse can
     be used.  This might be done to improve efficiency when, for example,
     a document has a wrapper but nothing is included in it.  Since it has
     a wrapper parsing will be turned on by default, but it is not necessary
     since nothing is actually included.
     <p>

     The line
     <blockquote>
     Attributes=cgi
     </blockquote>
     indicates that the standard CGI environment variables should be set
     up before processing this request.  This is may be useful if there is a
     <a href="#filter">Filter=</a> directive for this document or if the
     document has a <a href="#include">server-side include</a> which is
     the output of a script or program.  In these cases the filter program
     or include script can access the CGI environment variables.
     This line is not necessary if the document it refers to is actually
     a CGI script since in that case this attribute is automatically set.
     <p>

     The line
     <blockquote>
     Attributes=dynamic
     </blockquote>
     indicates that the server should send headers attempting to encourage
     clients and proxies not to cache this document. This is done by
     setting the Expires: date to Jan 1, 1970 (if it is not otherwise set),
     omitting a Last-Modified header and sending a Pragma: no-cache header.
     It is not necessary to set this for CGI scripts which have no dependence
     on a QUERY_STRING or POST data as it is set by default for them.  If 
     you do not wish this done for a CGI script then use the line

     <blockquote>
     Attributes=non-dynamic
     </blockquote>
     If this is done the Last-Modified date will be that of the script.
     <p>


     The line
     <blockquote>
     Attributes=nosearch
     </blockquote>
     indicates that the file referenced by this directive should not be
     searched when the server does a context or grep search of the
     current directory.
     <p>

     See also the <a href="#dattributes">directory Attributes</a> directive.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="encoding">Content-encoding</a></b> -- Specify the content
     encoding for a file
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Content-encoding=x-gzip
     </blockquote>
     specifies "x-gzip" as the content encoding for the file described
     by this record.  Only two types of content encoding are supported
     by common browsers.  They are "x-gzip" and "x-compress".  They
     indicate that the file has been compressed with the GNU gzip utility
     or the UNIX compress utility.  The file is then sent by the server
     in the compressed format and will be decompressed automatically
     by the browser, if it supports this functionality.
     <p>
     In many cases this is unnecessary to specify this explicitly as the
     <i>wndex</i> program will automatically assign the the content-encoding
     x-gzip to a file whose name ends with ".gz" and the content-encoding
     x-compress to a file whose name ends in ".Z".  Supplying the value
     "none" for the content-encoding will prevent the server from making
     this automatic assignment.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="content">Content-type</a></b> -- Specify the MIME content
     type for a file
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Content-type=audio/basic
     </blockquote>
     specifies "audio/basic" as the MIME type for the file described
     by this record.  In many cases this is unnecessary as the
     <i>wndex</i> program will automatically assign the MIME type
     if the file name ends in a suffix listed in the file
     /lib/mime.types with a corresponding type.  If this line
     is supplied it will override the default value of the content type
     determined by the suffix.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="expires">Expires</a></b> -- Specify the expiration
     date of a document or file
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Expires=Mon, 01 Sep 1997 14:11:01 GMT
     </blockquote><p>
     specifies date and time which a document expires.  Current practice
     is to use the format specified by RFC850 and illustrated above.
     In particular, GMT should be used.  More information about HTTP date
     formats can be found
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP1.0/HTTP1.0-ID_15.html">here</a>.
     For HTML documents the this information is automatically extracted from
     the document by <i>wndex</i>.  This requires a line in the
     head of the HTML document like
     <blockquote>
      &lt;meta http-equiv="Expires" content="Tue, 10 Oct 1994 14:11:01 GMT"&gt;
     </blockquote><p>

     If the Expires directive is also supplied in the index file
     it will override the expiration date in the document. See also
     the <a href="#maxage">Maxage directive.</a>
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="field">Field#n</a></b> -- Specify a user supplied field
     associated with a file
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Field3=string
     </blockquote><p>
     specifies "string" user supplied field #3 associated with the
     current document.  These are used for <a href="search.html#fielded">
     field searches.</a> The digit 3 can be replaced with any other single
     digit allowing a total of 10 user supplied fields. <p>

<dt> <b><a name="file">File</a></b> -- File name
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     File=foo
     </blockquote>
     begins a new file record for the file <i>foo</i>.  It indicates
     that permission is granted for this file to be served. Other
     file directive lines will apply to this file until a new file
     record or text segment is started or the end of the index file
     is reached.  The presence of this line causes an entry for this
     file to be written in the index.cache file created by <i>wndex.</i>
     <p>


<dt> <b><a name="filter">Filter</a></b> -- Specify the filter with which
     a file is to be postprocessed.
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Filter=/dir/foo
     </blockquote>
     causes the contents of the file whose record contains this line to
     be used as standard input of the program foo and the output of that
     program to be sent to the client instead of the file itself.  A
     common use of this is to specify a decompressing program like zcat
     as the filter so that a compressed version of a file can be stored
     on disk and then be decompressed on the fly before being sent to
     the client.  Another example would be "Filter=/usr/bin/nroff -man"
     which would convert an nroff man page to an ASCII text document
     on the fly. <p>
     
     If a listed file name begins with a '/' the name is considered as a path
     relative to the system root directory.  If it begins with '~/' as in
     <i>~/dir/foo</i> it is assumed to be relative to the WN root directory.
     Otherwise it is assumed to be a path relative to the directory
     containing the index file.  
     <p>
     
<dt> <b>Header</b> -- Add a line to the HTTP header for this document
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Header=[some legal HTTP header]
     </blockquote>
     causes the line [some legal HTTP header] to be added to the 
     HTTP header for this item.  <i>Don't do this unless you know
     what you are doing!</i>  This directive can be used multiple
     times to add multiple lines to the header.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="includes">Includes</a></b> -- Specify the files to
     be included in a text document
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Includes=file1,file2,file3
     </blockquote>
     causes the file whose record contains this line to be parsed for
     lines like &lt;!-- #include --&gt;.  When such a marker is found
     one of the files listed with the Includes= directive is inserted.
     Subsequent occurrences of the marker cause the inclusion of subsequent
     files in the order in which they occur in this directive. <p>

     If a listed file name begins with a '/' the name is considered as a path
     relative to the system root directory.  If it begins with '~/' as in
     <i>~/dir/foo</i> it is assumed to be relative to the WN root directory.
     Otherwise it is assumed to be a path relative to the directory
     containing the index file.  See the section of the user guide on
     <a href="parse.html">includes and wrappers</a> for more information. <p>
     
<dt> <b><a name="keywords">Keywords</a></b> -- Specify the keywords
     associated with a document or file
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Keywords=pink, elephant, HTTP
     </blockquote><p>
     specifies a list of keywords assoicated with the current document.
     These are used for <a href="search.html#keyword">keyword searches.</a>
     For HTML documents the keywords are automatically extracted from
     the document by <i>wndex</i>.  This requires a line in the
     head of the HTML document like
     <blockquote>
      &lt;meta http-equiv="Keywords" content="pink, elephant, HTTP"&gt;
     </blockquote><p>

     If the Keywords directive is also supplied in the index file
     it will override the keywords in the document.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="maxage">Max-Age</a></b> -- Specify the Cache-Control
     and Expires headers for an entry
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Max-Age= 10 days
     </blockquote><p>
     specifies that a Cache-Contol header should be sent to expire
     the document in the specified time.  If no <a href="#expires">
     Expires header</a> has been set elsewhere in the index file or
     in the file itself, if it is an HTML file, then the Expires
     header will also be sent with a value equal to the current time
     plus the time period of the Max-Age header.  The time period 
     in the Max-Age header can be specified in units of seconds, minutes,
     hours, days or weeks, but more than one unit (as in 2 weeks and 
     3 days) is not allowed.
     <p>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Max-Age= 10 days after last-mod
     </blockquote><p>
     specifies that a Cache-Contol header and the Expires header (if none
     is set elsewhere) should be set to expire the document in the 
     specified amount of time after the last-modified date of the 
     document.  Negative time values for the Cache-Control header
     will be ignored, but Expires headers with dates in the past will
     be used.


<dt> <b><a name = "fnomatch">Nomatchsub</a></b> -- Set substitute file
     for searches on this file which result in no matches.
<dd>
     The line 

     <blockquote>
     Nomatchsub=foo.html
     </blockquote>

     specifies that the HTML file foo.html in the current directory
     should be used for the output of all searches (context, grep, etc.)
     on this file which return no matches.  It canonly be used in
     conjunction with the <a href="#swrapper">Searchwrapper</a>
     directive.  See also
     <a href="#dnomatch">Nomatchsub for directories.</a>
     <p>


<dt> <b><a name="redirect">Redirect</a></b> -- Send an HTTP redirect
     to a new URL
<dd>
     The lines

     <blockquote>
     File=foo<br>
     Redirect=http://host/path/bar<br>
     </blockquote>

     cause a request for <i>foo</i> to be answered with an HTTP redirect
     response.  The client will then automatically request the new URL.
     The file <i>foo</i> need not exist.
     <p>

     The redirection always send a "301 Moved Permanently" status header
     followed by a "Location:" header whose value is "http://host/path/bar".
     This means that the value of a Redirect= directive should always be
     a complete URL, starting with http:// or ftp:// etc.
     The one excepton is that you may use
     "Redirect=&lt;null&gt;".  This causes the server to send a status 204 "no
     response" which tells the client to do nothing and leave the
     display alone.  The page won't be reloaded and won't change.

     <p>
     
<dt> <b><a name="refresh">Refresh</a></b> -- Set a "Refresh" header
     for use with "client-pull"
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Refresh=60
     </blockquote>
     adds an HTTP header at the beginning of the transmission of
     this document.  If the client receiving this header supports
     "client-pull" (currently only Netscape browsers support this)
     then it will automatically reload the document after 60 seconds.
     This is useful for documents that are updated very frequently,
     a stock ticker, for example.  If the directive 
     <blockquote>
     Refresh=30; URL=http://host/path/foo
     </blockquote>
     is used then after 30 seconds the URL http://host/path/foo is
     loaded.  This can be used to create an automatic slide show.
     The Refresh header is not part of an HTTP standard and hence
     may evolve.  If it does this directive will be subject to change!
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="swrapper">Searchwrapper</a></b> -- Set wrapper
     file for searches on this file.
<dd>
     The line 

     <blockquote>
     Searchwrapper=swrap.html
     </blockquote>
     
     specifies that the HTML file swrap.html in the current directory
     should be used as a wrapper for the output of all searches on this
     file.
     <p>

<dt> <b><a name="cookie">Set-Cookie</a></b> -- Set a "Cookie" header
     value
<dd>
     The lines
     
     <blockquote>
     Set-Cookie=name1=opaque1<br>
     Set-Cookie=name=xxx; Expires=Thursday, 04-May-95 18:45:39 GMT<br>
     </blockquote>
     
     add an HTTP header at the beginning of the transmission of
     this document.  If the client receiving this header supports
     cookie caching (currently only Netscape browsers support this)
     then it will save the name=value pairs and include them in the
     request headers when documents in the same directory or sub-directories
     are accessed.  The server will put the name=value pairs in the
     environment variable HTTP_COOKIE for access by CGI scripts.
     This is useful for "shopping basket" type applications.
     <p>
     Normally the client will discard the cookie at the end of a session.
     However, if an Expires parameter like the one above is provided the
     cookie will be saved between sessions and only discarded when it
     expires.
     <p>
     More information about the proposed HTTP Set-Cookie header is available
     at <a href="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">

<dt> <b><a name="title">Title</a></b> -- Specify the title of a document
     or file
<dd>
     The line 

     <blockquote>
     Title=This the the title
     </blockquote>
     
     specifies the text "This is the title" as the title of the file.
     If the file is an HTML document this is not necessary as <i>wndex</i>
     will attempt to read the title from the document itself.  If this
     line is supplied anyway it will override the title in the document.
     If this line is not supplied and the file is not an HTML document
     the default title "File <filename>" is used.
     <p>
     

<dt> <b><a name="wrappers">Wrappers</a></b> -- Specify the files to be
     included in a text document
<dd>
     The line 
     <blockquote>
     Wrappers=file1
     </blockquote>
     causes file1 to be parsed for
     lines like &lt;!-- #include --&gt;.  When such a marker is found
     the file whose record contains this line is inserted and the
     combined document is sent to the client.  It is possible to
     list multiple files in this directive.  The semantics of this
     are explained in the section of the user guide on <a href="parse.html">
     server-side includes and wrappers</a>. <p>

     If a listed file name begins with a '/' the name is considered as a path
     relative to the system root directory.  If it begins with '~/' as in
     <i>~/dir/foo</i> it is assumed to be relative to the WN root directory.
     Otherwise it is assumed to be a path relative to the directory
     containing the index file.  See the section of the user guide on
     <a href="parse.html">includes and wrappers</a> for more information. <p>
