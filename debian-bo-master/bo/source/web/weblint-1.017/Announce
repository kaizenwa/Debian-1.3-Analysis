Weblint 1.017 is now available:

        http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/~neilb/weblint/
        ftp://ftp.cre.canon.co.uk/pub/weblint/weblint-1.017.tar.gz

Weblint is a syntax and minimal style checker for HTML: a Perl script which
picks fluff off HTML pages, much in the same way traditional lint picks fluff
off C programs.

This is probably the last release before weblint 2.000, which will require
Perl 5. Suggestions and ideas for weblint 2.000 would be appreciated.

Changes are summarized below, see the ChangeLog file in the distribution for
more detail.

Thanks to those who contributed to this release,

			Changes in Weblint 1.017


    *	Added a link to the Japanese weblint gateway, by Masayasu Ishikawa.
		http://www.aichi-u.ac.jp/~mimasa/jweblint/

    *	Added a link to Jim Carpenter's weblint gateway:
		http://www.tiac.net/users/zach1/htmlcheck/htmlcheck.shtml

    *	Added support for missing values of ALIGN when in the IMG
	element: TEXTTOP, ABSMIDDLE, BASELINE, ABSBOTTOM.

    *	Weblint now won't generate warnings for attributes of unknown elements;
	this includes extended markup, when the relevant extension is not
	enabled.

    *	You now get multiple warnings if '>' occurs multiple times,
	where it should be represted as &gt;.

    *	Fixed the problem where warnings about use of literal '>' would
	often give the wrong line number.

    *	Re-organized the weblint web pages, and added a page with information
	on supported platforms: Unix, NT, Mac, OS/2.

    *	I had accidentally deleted the section in weblintrc for things added
	in the 1.015 release. I put them back.
