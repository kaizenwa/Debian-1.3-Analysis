1.017

    4-july-1996 neilb

    *	Added support for missing values of ALIGN when in the IMG
	element: TEXTTOP, ABSMIDDLE, BASELINE, ABSBOTTOM.

    8-june-1996 neilb

    *	Entered a bunch of outstanding bug reports and feature requests;
	regenerated the web pages for these.

    *	Restructured the weblint web pages, and added a page with information
	about supported platforms.


    4-june-1996 neilb

    *	Added a link to Jim Carpenter's weblint gateway:

    *	Weblint now won't generate warnings for attributes of unknown elements;
	this includes extended markup, when the relevant extension is not
	enabled. For example, if you have:

		<FONT SIZE="+1">Hello, World</FONT>

	Then you'd get a warning about extended markup, and also one
	about the value of the SIZE attribute being illegal. Once you've
	enabled the Netscape or Microsoft extension, it's not illegal.


    *	You now get multiple warnings if '>' occurs multiple times,
	where it should be represted as &gt;. For example:
		<PRE>
			if (x > y)
				foobar();
			if (x > z)
				barfoo();
		</PRE>
	Will result in two warnings, where before you'd just get one.
	Both warnings will have the right line number :-)


    *	Fixed the problem where warnings about use of literal '>' would
	often give the wrong line number. For example:

		<PRE>
			if (x > y)
				foobar();
		</PRE>

	Would give the line number for "</PRE>" when warning about the '>'
	two lines above. Fixed the two test-cases for these warnings.


    24-may-1996 neilb

    *	The KNOWN BUGS section of the man page now includes the URL for the
	ToDo list for weblint.

    *	I had accidentally deleted the section in weblintrc for things added
	in the 1.015 release. I put them back.
