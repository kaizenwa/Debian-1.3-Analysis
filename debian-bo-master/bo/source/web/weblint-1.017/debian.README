This is Debian Linux's prepackaged version of weblint, the HTML
syntax and style checker by Neil Bowers.

This package was hacked together by Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>
with source from ftp://ftp.khoral.com/pub/weblint/weblint-1.016.tar.gz.

And updated to version 1.016 by Erick Branderhorst <branderh@debian.org>
when Darren didn't have the time to update.
