This file describes how to update from earlier versions of analog to 2.0.
It doesn't describe new features -- those are in the Readme -- but old
features that you can no longer use. As far as possible when I add new options,
I make the old options still work: but sometimes I need to do something a
completely different way and abolish the old options.

Mac users -- upgrading from 1.92 and earlier
--------------------------------------------
There is no longer an automatic progress report. You have to use the
PROGRESSFREQ command instead.

Upgrading from 1.9beta's
------------------------
Use configuration commands REQINCLUDE and LINKINCLUDE instead of REQTYPE and
PAGELINKS. (There are no headerfile equivalents).
(Also, not so many things are now pages by default).

Upgrading from 1.2's and earlier
--------------------------------
Use *MINREQS and *MINBYTES instead of *FLOOR.
Use *INCLUDE and *EXCLUDE instead of *ONLY and *IGNORE.
+1, +c, +f, +F, +G, +H and BACKGROUND removed or given new meanings.
Options to +d, +D, +h, +i, +m, +o, +r, +S and +W changed.
Syntax for wild alias matching changed.
Use *SORTBY REQUESTS or BYTES instead of *SORTBY BYREQUESTS or BYBYTES
Configuration files and commandline arguments now read in a different order.
The default configuration file now read unless explicitly excluded with -G.
