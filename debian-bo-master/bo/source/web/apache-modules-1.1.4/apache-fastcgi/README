Basic Directions
----------------

See the file mod_fastcgi.html for instructions on how
to use this module.

Define the macro APACHEVERSION to 10 for apache 1.0x versions.

Linux users might need to modify the OS dependent function 
GetStreamSize() in mod_fastcgi.c (see notes in version 1.2)

What's New: Version 1.2, 3 June 1996
--------------------------------------
1.  Ported from Apache-1.0-based code to Apache-1.1b2 internals by
    Ralf S. Engelschall
    <rse@en.muc.de>
    Add version string: APACHEVERSION macro to mod_fastcgi.c

2.  chown FastCGI socket to user_id and setuid to user_id for app
    class processes

3.  Modify GetFromStream() by having it call an OS dependent
    function GetStreamSize(FILE *) which uses FILE internal data member. 
    Linux users might need to modify GetStreamSize().


Version 1.1, 10 May 1996
--------------------------------------

Fixed two bugs:

  1. If you specify a non-existent executable in
     the AppClass directive, or if the file exists
     and it does not have execute permission you
     get a constant stream of error messages
     telling you that "program terminated due to
     a signal".

  2. The mod_fastcgi module should use the
     standard Apache error logging facility
     instead of writing to stderr.
