This file contails two sets of directions for installing xssi.   If you
have and want to use a working posix.2 compliant regex package use
the instructions for INSTALLING WITH POSIX REGEX.  Otherwise, use the
instructions for INSTALLING WITH INCLUDED REGEX.

A posix regex package will have /usr/include/regex.h, and the functions
regcomp, regexec, regerror, and regfree in libc. You might want to verify
that it work as well.  For example, rumor has it that solaris 2.4 is
compliant but does not work.

===============================
= INSTALLING WITH POSIX REGEX =
===============================

1) cp mod_xinclude.c to the apache source directory ($APACHE in these
   instructions).
       $ cp mod_xinclude.c $APACHE

2) Edit your Apache Configuration file and makde the following changes
   From:
       Module includes_module	mod_include.o
   To:
       Module includes_module	mod_xinclude.o

   Add:
       -DHAVE_POSIX_REGEX to CFLAGS.

3) Build apache
       $ cd $APACHE
       $ ./Configure
       $ make

==================================
= INSTALLING WITH INCLUDED REGEX =
==================================

1) cp mod_xinclude.c to the apache source directory ($APACHE in these
   instructions).
       $ cp mod_xinclude.c $APACHE

2) Edit your Apache Configuration file
   From:
       Module includes_module	mod_include.o
   To:
       Module includes_module	mod_xinclude.o

   Add:
       -Iregex to CFLAGS
       -Lregex -lregex to EXTRA_LIBS

3) Copy and build the regex library:
       $ cp -r regex $APACHE
       $ cd $APACHE/regex
       # follow the instructions in the makefile and make

4) Make apache
       $ cd $APACHE
       $ ./Configure
       $ make
