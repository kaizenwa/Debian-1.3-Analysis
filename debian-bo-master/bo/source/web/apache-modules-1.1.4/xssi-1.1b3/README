                                  xssi
                               Version 1.1

What is it?
-----------
xssi is a modification to the standard include module provided
with apache to support an extended ssi language.  Some of the
features of this new langauge include:
    - conditional inclusion
    - regular expression tests for conditionals
    - ability to set and use variables

This version applies to apache 1.1.

(WARNING: the use of any ssi program will increase the load on your
server.  xssi is much worse in this regard than the standard apache
ssi due to its parsing and its handling of regular expressions.
If you are running a heavily loaded server, you should think twice
about running xssi.)

I have compiled and run this software on sunos 4.1.3.
