 *
 * This module allows you to block access to your site that was
 * referred to from a certain URL. This isn't a 100%-foolproof
 * way of preventing access to your site, but if someone has a link
 * to a page or image of yours, that you don't like, it's a pretty
 * good way of blocking access from that location.
 *
 * Example:
 * BlockReferer www.organic.com
 * BlockReferer netscape.com/comprod/sales/index.html
