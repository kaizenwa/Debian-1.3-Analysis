DHTTPD, file AUTHOR:

Hi there!  I'd like to introduce you to myself and dhttpd/1.02 :)

I'm David A. Bartold, a senior at Westwood High School
in Austin, TX (USA), and this is my first completed attempt at
writing an internet server.

It started out as a small project to write a simple server
that my friends couldn't hack, i.e. one that doesn't allow
cgi scripts, and one that didn't require a permanent IP
address to use properly.  When I finally completed this
server to working condition, I realized it was memory
efficient, low profile, quick, and served the one need I
had in an HTTP daemon: to transmit files.  And that's
when I realized that others out there might be looking for
those same qualities in their web page server.

And thus, that's when dhttpd breathed its first life and
I learned how the HTTP protocol works.

I hope you enjoy using it as I did writing it :)
