                          Mailing List Info


Thanks to Karsten Thygesen, Wget has its own mailing list for
discussion and announcements.  The list address is
<wget@sunsite.auc.dk>.

To subscribe, send mail to <wget-request@sunsite.auc.dk> with the
magic word subscribe in the subject; the same stands for
unsubscribing.

The mailing list is low-volume; you are welcome to subscribe -- the
more people on the list, the better! :-)

The list is archived at
<URL:http://fly.cc.fer.hr/en/wget-archive.mbox>.
