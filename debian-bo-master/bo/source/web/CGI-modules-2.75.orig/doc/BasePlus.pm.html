DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>

This module implements a CGI::BasePlus object that is identical in
behavior to CGI::Base except that it provides special handling for
postings of MIME type multipart/form-data (which may get very long).
In the case of these types of postings, parts that are described
as being from a file upload are copied into a temporary file in
/usr/tmp, a filehandle is opened on the temporary files, and the name
of the filehandle is returned to the caller in the
<STRONG>$CGI::Base:QUERY_STRING</STRONG> variable.
<p>Please see <EM>CGI::Base</EM> for more information.
