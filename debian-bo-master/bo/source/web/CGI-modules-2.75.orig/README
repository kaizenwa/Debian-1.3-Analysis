These are the CGI:: modules for perl5, for use in writing CGI scripts.
In addition to this package, you will also need the URI::Unescape
class, which is part of the libwww-perl package.  It can be obtained
at any of the following CPAN archives:

      ftp://ftp.cis.ufl.edu/pub/perl/CPAN/ 
      ftp://ftp.cs.ruu.nl/pub/PERL/CPAN/ 
      ftp://ftp.delphi.com/pub/mirrors/packages/perl/CPAN/ 
      ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/ 
      ftp://ftp.is.co.za/programming/perl/CPAN/ 
      ftp://ftp.pasteur.fr/pub/Perl/CPAN/ 
      ftp://ftp.sterling.com/programming/languages/perl/ 
      ftp://janus.sedl.org/pub/mirrors/CPAN/ 
      ftp://orpheu.ci.uminho.pt/pub/lang/perl/ 

To install these modules, cd to the directory that this README file is
in and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

Documentation for these modules is part of the files themselves using
the pod (Plain Old Documentation) format, and can be read using the
pod2man and pod2html programs that come with perl5.001.  To convert
them into manual page format, type something like the following:

	pod2man Base.pm > Base.man

To convert them into html format, type:

	pod2html *.pm

(pod2html automatically creates a file named *.pm.html)

For your convenience, html-ized documentation is already installed in
the doc/ subdirectory.

Online documentation of these modules as well as related modules (such
as the earlier CGI.pm module)  can be found at:
