=head1 NAME

CGI::MiniSvr - Adds to CGI::Base the ability for a CGI script to become
a mini http server.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

	

    use CGI::MiniSvr;
	
    $cgi = new CGI::MiniSvr;
    $cgi = new CGI::MiniSvr $port_or_path;
    $cgi = new CGI::MiniSvr $port_or_path, $timeout_mins;
	
    $cgi->port;               # return MiniSvr port number with leading colon

    $cgi->spawn;              # fork/detach from httpd
	
    $cgi->get;                # get input
	
    $cgi->pass_thru($host, $port);
    $cgi->redirect($url);
	
    $cgi->done;               # end 'page' and close connection (high-level)
    $cgi->close;              # just close connection (low-level)


See also the CGI::Base methods.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file implements the CGI::MiniSvr object. This object represents an
alternative I<interface> between the application and an HTTP deamon.

In a typical CGI scenario the I<interface> is just a collection of
environment variables passed to a process which then generated some
outout and exits. The CGI::Base class implements this standard
interface.

The CGI::MiniSvr class inherits from CGI::Base and extends it to
implement a 'mini http daemon' which can be spawned (forked) from a CGI
script in order to maintain state information for a client 'session'.

This is very useful. It neatly side-steps many of the painful issues
involved in writing real-world multi-screen applications using the
standard CGI interface (namely saving and restoring state between
screens).

Another use for the MiniSvr is to allow cgi scripts to produce output
pages with dynamically generated in-line graphics (for example). To do
this the script would spawn a MiniSvr and refer to its port number in
the URL's for the embedded images. The MiniSvr would then sit on the
port, with a relatively short timeout, ready to serve the requests for
those images.  Once all the images have been served the MiniSvr would
simply exit.

Like the CGI::Base module the CGI::MiniSvr module does not do any
significant data parsing. Higher level query processing (forms etc) is
performed by the CGI::Request module.

Note that the implementation of these modules means that you should
invoke C<new CGI::Base;> before C<new CGI::MiniSvr;>. This is the
natural order anyway and so should not be a problem.


=head2 WARNING!

This module is B<not> a good solution to many problems! It is only a good
solution to some. It should only be used by those who understand why it
is B<not> a good solution to many problems!

For those who don't see the pitfalls of the mini server approach,
consider just this one example:  what happens to your machine if new
'sessions' start, on average, faster than abandoned ones timeout?

Security and short-lifespan URL's are some of the other problems.

If in doubt don't use it! If you do then don't blame me for any of the
problems you may (will) experience. B<You have been warned!>


=head2 DIRECT ACCESS USAGE

In this mode the MiniSvr creates an internet domain socket and returns
to the client a page with URL's which contain the MiniSvr's own port
number.

  $q = GetRequest();      # get initial request
  $cgi = new CGI::MiniSvr;# were going to switch to CGI::MiniSvr later
  $port = $cgi->port;     # get our port number (as ':NNNN') for use in URL's
  $me = "http://$SERVER_NAME$port$SCRIPT_NAME"; # build my url
  print "Hello... <A HREF="$me?INSIDE"> Step Inside ...</A>\r\n";
  $cgi->done(1);          # flush out page, include debugging
  $cgi->spawn and exit 0; # fork, original cgi process exits
  CGI::Query::Interface($cgi); # default to new interface

  while($q = GetQuery() or $cgi->exit){ # await request/timeout
     ...
  }


=head2 INDIRECT ACCESS USAGE

In this mode the MiniSvr creates a unix domain socket and returns to the
client a page with a hidden field containing the path to the socket.

  $q = GetRequest(); # get initial request
  $path = $q->param('_minisvr_socket_path');
  if ($path) {
      # just pass request on to our mini server
      $q->cgi->pass_thru('', $path) or (...handle timeout...)
      $q->cgi->done;
  } else {
      # launch new mini server
      $path = "/tmp/cgi.$$";
      $cgi = new CGI::MiniSvr $path; # unix domain socket
      # code here mostly same as 'DIRECT ACCESS' above except that
      # the returned page has an embedded field _minisvr_socket_path
      # set to $path
      ...
  }

=head2 SUBCLASSING THE MINISVR

In some cases you may wish to have more control over the behaviour of
the mini-server, such as handling some requests at a low level without
disturbing the application.  Subclassing the server is generally a good
approach. Use something like this:

  #   Define a specialised subclass of the MiniSvr for this application
  {
    package CGI::MiniSvr::FOO;
    use CGI::MiniSvr;
    @ISA = qw(CGI::MiniSvr);

    # Default behaviour for everything except GET requests for .(gif|html|jpg)
    # Note that we must take great care not to: a) try to pass_thru to ourselves
    # (it would hang), or b) pass_thru to the server a request which it will
    # try to satisfy by starting another instance of this same script!

    sub method_GET {
        my $self = shift;
        if ($self->{SCRIPT_NAME} =~ m/\.(gif|jpg|html)$/){
            $self->pass_thru('', $self->{ORIG_SERVER_PORT});
            $self->done;
            return 'NEXT';
        }
        1;
    }
    # ... other overriding methods can be defined here ...
  }

Once defined you can use your new customised mini server by changing:

  $cgi = new CGI::MiniSvr;

into:

  $cgi = new CGI::MiniSvr::FOO;

With the example code above any requests for gif, jpg or html will be
forwarded to the server which originally invoked this script. The application
no longer has to deal with them. I<Note:> this is just an example usage
for the mechanism, you would typically generate pages in which any
embedded images had URL's which refer explicitly to the main httpd.

With a slight change in the code above you can arrange for the handling
of the pass-thru to occur in a subprocess. This frees the main process
to handle other requests. Since the MiniSvr typically only exists for
one process, forking off a subprocess to handle a request is only
useful for browsers such as Netscape which make multiple parallel
requests for inline images.

    if ($self->{SCRIPT_NAME} =~ m/\.(gif|html|jpg)$/){
        if ($self->fork == 0) {
            $self->pass_thru('', $self->{ORIG_SERVER_PORT});
            $self->exit;
        }
        $self->done;
        return 'NEXT';
    }

Note that forking can be expensive. It might not be worth doing for
small images.

=head2 FEATURES

Object oriented and sub-classable.

Transparent low-level peer validation (no application involvement
but extensible through subclassing).

Transparent low-level pass_thru/redirecting of URL's the application
is not interested in  (no application involvement but extensible
through subclassing).

Effective timeout mechanism with default and per-call settings.

Good emulation of standard CGI interface (for code portability).


=head2 RECENT CHANGES

=over

=item 2.2 and 2.3

Slightly improved documentation. Added a basic fork() method. Fixed
timeout to throw an exception so it's reliable on systems which restart
system calls. Socket/stdio/filehandle code improved. Cleaned up
done/close relationship. Added experimental support for optionally
handling requests by forking on a case-by-case basis. This is handy for
serving multiple simultaneous image requests from Netscape for example.
Added notes about the MiniSvr, mainly from discussions with Jack Shirazi
Removed old explicit port searching code from _new_inet_socket().
Improved SIGPIPE handling (see CGI::Base).

=item 2.1

Fixed (worked around) a perl/stdio bug which affected POST handling.
Changed some uses of map to foreach. Slightly improved debugging.
Added support for any letter case in HTTP headers. Enhanced test code.

=item 2.0

Added more documentation and examples. The max pending connections
parameter for listen() can now be specified as a parameter to new().
SIGPIPE now ignored by default. Simplified inet socket code with ideas
from Jack Shirazi. Improved server Status-Line header handling. Fixed
validate_peer() error handling and redirect().  Simplified get_vars()
by splitting into get_valid_connection() and read_headers(). Moved
example method_GET() out of MiniSvr and into the test script.

The module file can be run as a cgi script to execute a demo/test. You
may need to chmod +x this file and teach your httpd that it can execute
*.pm files.

=item 1.18

Added note about possible use of MiniSvr to serve dynamically generated
in-line images. Added optional DoubleFork mechanism to spawn which
might be helpful for buggy httpd's, off by default.

=item 1.17

Added support for an 'indirect, off-net, access' via a local UNIX
domain socket in the file system. Now uses strict. ORIG_* values now
stored within object and not exported as globals (Base CGI vars
remain unchanged).  See CGI::Base for some more details.

=back

=head2 FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Full pod documentation.

None of this is perfect. All suggestions welcome.

Test unix domain socket mechanism.

Issue/problem - the handling of headers. Who outputs them and when? We
have a sequence of: headers, body, end, read, headers, body, end, read
etc. The problem is that a random piece of code can't tell if the
headers have been output yet. A good solution will probably have to
wait till we have better tools for writing HTML and we get away from
pages of print statements.

A method for setting PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED to meaningful values
would be handy.

It is not a theoretical problem -- Prodigy, CompuServe, and America
Online all use multiple egress firewalls through which they generate
connections from web proxy servers (plural) inside the firewall, each
serving multiple clients.  This is easily determined by inspection of
the DNS records.

GEnie plans to have a similar setup.  Our internal DNS provides
round-robin resource records to clients via "egress.genie.net" which
randomly selects a firewall through which to establish a connection.
Currently this resolves to the INTERNAL address of what is known on the
net as "fw1.genie.net" and "fw2.genie.net".  199.164.140.{11|12}.

Prodigy has already released about 500,000 new people onto the Web.
Both America Online and CompuServe are going to add another 2 million
or so on top of that, and GEnie will add a much more modest amount. :)
By my calculations this increases the universe of web users by a factor
of 50-75% (my business partner just quirped up and said more than
doubles the number!) in the span of about 6 months.

It may be a theoretical problem today; it will be a practial problem
tomorrow, as more companies and other sites create robust
fault-tolerant solutions for connecting to the 'net securely.
(oxymoron alert!)

I just wanted to alert yo to a potential problem given what
I *know* will be happening in the very near future.

You are assuming a) a long default timeout and b) that everyone orphans
their mini-server. The former is possible, the latter is unrealistic.

The only time a mini-server would be orphaned (for want of a better term)
would be if the user does not follow one of the links on a page produced
by the mini-server. Typically a 'commit' button would commit the changes
to the database and the mini-server would produce a new page and exit.

That's an application choice. The default will probably be around 5 minutes.
Some applications may set it higher, some lower. Some may change it from
dynamically.

That's a tradeoff you have to make. It would be possible to have a field
on the form to allow a user settable timeout (within application limits).

Why? Please explain in detail. Remember that the mini-server is started
by a full server which can deal with the 'big' authentication issues
and 'set the scene' before it starts the cgi script. I'm very happy to
add any checks as required but I need hard facts. The mini-server
already always re-validates the client ip address.

I think you're missing the point. I'm talking about relational database
transactions made by a client over a series of forms.

You *cannot* simply 'keep a list of changes' because once a change is
commited other database users may have started using your changed data
and/or your changes may have triggered database procedures. Basically
once commited it's too late! With a process-per-form you'd have to commit.

Using an external server for this type of application is:
a) *much* more complicated form many reasons including the need to
pipe returned query data (how do you send a rows of data, possibly
including image blobs, back from the server to the cgi application?)
b) is only possible for databases which allow one process to manage/juggle
many distinct database connections.
c) has poor performance (latency) under load (unless you make the server
multi-threaded and few if any database vendors support multi-threaded clients).

The mini-server currently validates that the same ip address is being
used. Other authentication checks can be added. Within reason any
authentication checks a full server can do a mini-server could also do.

This is no different to existing CGI applications. HTTPD daemons don't
'validate' the input in any meaningful sense. If you have a form with
an text field and your cgi script evals the contents of that field
the httpd will not stand in your way.

It's a trade-off. Swap-space vs process creation overhead.
