Isite Release Notes

1.08

- Fixed bug in SIMPLE doctype which caused hang for headlines with no
  newline
- Fixed bug in AddRecordList affecting Iindex "-s" parameter
- Added locale fixes to all main programs (Isearch, Iindex, Iutil,
  zserver, zclient, izclient, zgate and zcon)
- Fixed Boolean term parsing problem in zpdu.cxx
- Moved Isearch-cgi into the Isearch subdirectory
- Added methods to SIMPLE doctype to add <pre> tags to HTML presentation
- Minor bug fixes to DIF doctype
- Merged USMARC doctype with main distribution
- Remove has to be call before rename since the MSDOS and WIN32 rename
  is documented as failing if the new filename refers to a file which
  exists (unlike UNIX rename which will simply remove the file). (John
  Wehle) 
- src/index.hxx was missing a const from the ValidateInField
  declaration. (John Wehle) 
- src/merge.cxx was missing an include for memory.h. (John Wehle)
- src/merge.cxx tries to do arithmitic with a void pointer (it need to
  be cast to char). (John Wehle)
- INFIX2RPN::StandardizeOpName in src/infix2rpn.cxx was missing a return
  to handle the case of an unknown operator (maybe this can't happen due
  to how the code works, but the compiler didn't know that and was
  unhappy). (John Wehle)
- src/Iindex.cxx tried to use rm to remove the field data files. (John
  Wehle) 
- The Microsoft compilers had a fit with:
       static const char *find_next_tag (const char *const *tag_list,
         const char *const *tags)
  However they accept:
       static const char *find_next_tag (char *const *tag_list,
         char *const *tags)
  without any problems. (John Wehle)
- Cosmetic changes to MergeIndex in Isearch/index.cxx (John Wehle)
- ber.hxx included unistd.h which isn't available under MSDOS / WIN32.
- ipbuf.hxx included gdt.h and string.hxx directly even though they
  are included by unisock.hxx which is also included by ipbuf.hxx.  This
  broke the work around for the PINT and PLONG problem. (John Wehle)
- zclient.cxx was missing a return 0 at the end of main. (John Wehle)
- zserver.hxx and zsession.hxx try to include values.h in order to
  pick up MAXINT which isn't used anywhere in the code.  Probably
  limits.h should be used when neccessary as it is likely to be
  more portable. (John Wehle)
- zsession.cxx needs to include process.h under MSDOS / WIN32. (John Wehle)
- cgi-util.hxx tries to include stream.h which I believe is an
  obsolete header file. (John Wehle)
- isrch_srch.cxx and search_form.cxx try to include sys/time.h which
  isn't available under MSDOS / WIN32 though <time.h> is available.
  Actually, I believe that <time.h> is all that's needed on many
  UNIX platforms anyway. (John Wehle)
- search_form.cxx was missing a return at the end of main. (John Wehle)
- CGIAPP::GetValueByName in cgi-util.cxx was compating the value
  of a pointer against '\0' instead of NULL. (John Wehle)
