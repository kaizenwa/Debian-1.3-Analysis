<HR>
When you click the "Connect to Service" button, you will establish a stateful 
Z39.50 connection to the selected service.  You may then interact with 
that service.  If no input is received for five minutes, your session will 
expire and you will need to return to this page to log in again.  If you 
experience long delays in receiving a search response, you may need to
log in again.
