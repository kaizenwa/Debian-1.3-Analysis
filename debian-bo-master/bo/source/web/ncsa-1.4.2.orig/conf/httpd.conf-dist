# This is the main server configuration file. It is best to 
# leave the directives in this file in the order they are in, or
# things may not go the way you'd like. See URL http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/
# for instructions.

# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do, if you are unsure consult the online docs. You have been
# warned.  

# NCSA httpd (comments, questions to httpd@ncsa.uiuc.edu)

# ServerType is either inetd, or standalone.

ServerType standalone

# If you are running from inetd, go to "ServerAdmin".

# Port: The port the standalone listens to. For ports < 1023, you will
# need httpd to be run as root initially.

Port 80

# StartServers: The number of servers to launch at startup.  Must be
# compiled without the NO_PASS compile option

StartServers 5

# MaxServers: The number of servers to launch until mimic'ing the 1.3
# scheme (new server for each connection).  These servers will stay around
# until the server is restarted.  They will be reused as needed, however.
# See the documentation on hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu for more information.

MaxServers 20

# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.  

# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.

User nobody
Group #-1

# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.

ServerAdmin you@your.address

# ServerRoot: The directory the server's config, error, and log files
# are kept in

ServerRoot /usr/local/etc/httpd

# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file. If this does not start
# with /, ServerRoot is prepended to it.

ErrorLog logs/error_log

# TransferLog: The location of the transfer log file. If this does not
# start with /, ServerRoot is prepended to it.

TransferLog logs/access_log

# AgentLog: The location of the agent log file.  If this does not start
# with /, ServerRoot is prepended to it.

AgentLog logs/agent_log

# RefererLog: The location of the referer log file.  If this does not
# start with /, ServerRoot is prepended to it.

RefererLog logs/referer_log

# RefererIgnore: If you don't want to keep track of links from certain
# servers (like your own), place it here.  If you want to log them all,
# keep this line commented.

#RefererIgnore servername

# PidFile: The file the server should log its pid to
PidFile logs/httpd.pid

# ServerName allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for
# your server if it's different than the one the program would get (i.e. use
# "www" instead of the host's real name).
#
# Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you 
# define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't understand
# this, ask your network administrator.

#ServerName new.host.name
