Quote from "Statement Concerning CERN W3 Software Release Into Public
Domain", dated 3 May, 1993:

	Declaration

	The following CERN software is hereby put into the public
	domain:
		- W3 basic ("line-mode") client
		- W3 basic server
		- W3 library of common code.

	CERN's intention in this is to further compatibility, common
	practices, and standards in networking and computer supported
	collaboration.  This does not constitute a precedent to be
	applied to any other CERN copyright software.

	CERN relinquishes all intellectual property rights to this
	code, both source and binary form and permission is granted
	for anyone to use, duplicated, modify and redistribute it.

	CERN provides absolutely NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND with respect
	to this software.  The entire risk as to the quality and
	performance of this software is with the user.  IN NO EVENT
	WILL CERN BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT THE
	USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
	RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR LOST PROFITS, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL,
	INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.


THIS PACKAGE INCLUDES:
  * source code under the WWW directory [where this README file is]
    To compile just type

		make

    and binaries will appear in Daemon/xxx where xxx is your host's
    architecture, like sun4 or next.

  * README-SOCKS explaining how to compile and use SOCKSified httpd
  * server_root/ directory containing:
     * Sample configuration files for httpd in config/
	- httpd.conf for normal use as HTTP server
	- prot.conf for normal use as HTTP server with access control
	- proxy.conf for proxy use without caching
	- caching.conf for proxy use with caching
	- all.conf that contains all the configuration directives
	  understood by httpd

     * Sample icons in icons/
	- to be used for directory listings, and also for ftp listings
	  when using httpd as a proxy
	- simplist way to make use of the icons is to define the
	  server root directory to be server_root under this current
	  directory [where this README file sits], by specifying in
	  the configuration file:

		ServerRoot  /what/ever/server_root


ONLINE DOCUMENTATION for this software is in:

	http://info.cern.ch/httpd/

PRECOMPILED BINARIES of this software are available for many platforms
from:
	ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin

If you have any PROBLEMS with this software, or find a BUG, contact:

	httpd@info.cern.ch

Remember to run httpd in VERBOSE MODE [with the -v or -vv command line
option] when things seem to be going wrong and attach the output to
your mail message.  This will make our job a lot easier.

If httpd crashes and a core image is generated, run "dbx /path/httpd"
and say "where" to see where the execution was when the program
crashed.

Have fun!
