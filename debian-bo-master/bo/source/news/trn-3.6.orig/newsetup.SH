Welcome to trn.  Here's some important things to remember:

  o  Trn is an extension of rn and has a similar command syntax.
  o  To access all the new features, specify the options -x and -X.  These
     options MAY be on by default, but it won't hurt to be redundant.
  o  Single-character commands don't require a carriage return -- only
     commands that let you type in an argument.
  o  At ANY prompt, you may type 'h' for help.  There are many different help
     menus, depending on the context.  Also, typing <esc>h in the middle of a
     multi-character command will list escape substitutions.
  o  Typing a space to any prompt means to do the normal thing.  You could
     spend all day reading news and never hit anything but the space bar.
  o  If you have never used the news system before, you may find the articles
     in news.announce.newusers to be helpful.
  o  Please consult the man page for complete information.

Done.

To add new group use "a pattern" or "g newsgroup.name".  To get rid of
newsgroups you aren't interested in, use the 'u' command.
