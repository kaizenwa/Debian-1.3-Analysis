.SH NAME
newsetup - a program to set up a .newsrc file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B newsetup
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I newsetup
program creates a new .newsrc file containing an list of recommended
newsgroups for the first time user.
If your news admin has specified such a list (usually in the file
NEWSLIB/subscriptions) trn will use that as a default for your .newsrc.
Otherwise you get a ridiculously small list that you'll want to add to
using the \*(L"a pattern\*(R" command in trn (such as \*(L"a linux\*(R").
If you already have a .newsrc, it will be backed up with the name
\*(L".newsrc-old\*(R".
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP DOTDIR 8
Where to put your .newsrc, if not in your home directory.
.Sp
Default: $HOME
.IP HOME 8
