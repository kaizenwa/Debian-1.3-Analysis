To compile do the following:

1.  Read and edit knews.tmpl to make sure your compiler is OK.

2.  Read and edit configure.h.  This is for configuration of
    defaults, plus some other stuff.

3.  If you skipped 1 or 2, go back to 1. :-)

4.  Execute the following command in the top directory:

	xmkmf
	make Makefiles
	make clean
	make all

5.  If all goes well, this will leave an executable named knews in src/.

6.  Read and edit the app-def file src/Knews.ad.

7.  If you are root, you can install knews by executing 'make install'
    and 'make install.man'.  This will also install the app-def file
    src/Knews.ad.

8.  If you are not root you will have to install src/knews by hand.
    You will also have to install the app-def file src/Knews.ad.
    See that file for hints.

The code is expected to compile more or less without warnings.

If something in the make process goes wrong first check the files
configure.h and knews.tmpl for hints.  If that doesn't help, your best
bet is to hack the src/Makefile.  E.g. sometimes imake specifies libraries
to link against in EXTRA_LIBRARIES that can't be found.  Just remove them
from the Makefile. (The libraries that are needed are:  -lWidgets (my
widget library) and the X libraries, and maybe some system specific library
such as  -lsocket.)

Note that if you edit knews.tmpl , configure.h or any Imakefile, you must
redo 'xmkmf ; make Makefiles ; make clean'  to ensure that it takes effect.
