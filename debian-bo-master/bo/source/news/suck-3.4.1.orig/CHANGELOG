--Changes in Suck-3.4.0
both.c - vprint_phrases() - rewrote to handle a couple of bugs,
	1, if len = PHRASES_BLOCK_SIZE then no null termination,
	2, if string arg > PHRASES_BLOCK_SIZE, infinite looped.

suck.c - free_phrases() - fix typos of free_array() call for
	dedupe_phrases which caused a SIGBUS error.
       - get_message_index() - fix bugs in error_log() call for
	 error messages for group command
       - main() - handle suck -V  to correctly display version
	 number without putting a hostname in.

31 Mar 97 - suck-3.4.1 released

--Changes in Suck-3.3.2

*.* - Tweaks to various configs to make more portable.

*.c - got rid of all lingering \r\n in log and status messages.
      Added #define <sys/types.h> before sys/stat.h in various .c
      files, for more portability (Ultrix needs this).

 phrases.h
*phrases.c - created.  This is the code that loads in the language
	phrases, so you can rewrite the screen messages into
	another language, or just rewrite them.  This necessitated
	changing every print to a screen to call print_phrases().

both.c  - read_array(), do_a_phrases(), free_array(),
	convert_nl() - added.
	These are used by the load_phrases() routines to
	read in one array and alloc the memory for each phrases.
	- print_phrases() vprint_phrases(), str_int() - added.
	These routines print the phrases out with vars included.
	- signal_block() - added code to block PAUSESIGNAL.
	- error_log() - modified to call vprint_phrases() so that
	phrases print correctly.

killfile.c - parse_killfile(), chk_msg_kill() - changed killfile
	logging from a command time to run time argument, added
	logyn to Master killfile structure.
	regex_scan() - fixed bug in handling quote character
	check_a_group() -  changed \r to \n in checking nr of groups
	check_a_group(), parse_a_file() - added code to handle
	pathhost, subject, from, and nntp separators in group killfile.

rpost.c - main(), scan_args() - added stuff to process language 
	file.
	- free_phrases() - added, frees up memory from language file
	load.
	- load_phrases() - added, loads in the language file.

suck.c - main(), scan_args() - added code to pass killog_yn to
	killfile routines.  Added coded to process language file.
	Added coded to set up PAUSESIGNAL.

	- get_message_index() - fixed bugs in writing suck.newrc,
	one where if invalid line, and one where maxread was
	never getting written back out.  Also fixed bug in notting
	writing out line if error from server.  Fixed bug in 
	writing file where the cmd was written instead of line from
	file.  Fixed bug where could write to a NULL fp at end of
	routine.

	- get_articles() - rewrote way I calculate width of nritems
	for screen display, got rid of the log10() call, making
	the math lib (-lm) unnecessary.
	
	- load_phrases() - added, loads in the language file.
	- free_phrases() - added, frees up memory from language file
	load.

	- restart_yn() - fix bug in print of error message which
	  caused it not to show the path of the suck.restart file,
	  but rather show suck.sorted twice.

	- sighandler() - added code to handle PAUSESIGNAL

	- pause_signal() - created, swap pause_* with sig_* if we
	  are called by signal handler.  This allows the user to
	  slow down suck while we are running.
 
testhost.c - main() - added coded to process language file.

	- load_phrases() - added, loads in the language file.
	- free_phrases() - added, frees up memory from language file
	load.

timer.c - TimerFunc() - changed to write to file vice string, so can
	call print_phrases()

16 Mar 97 - suck-3.4.0 released

--Changes in Suck-3.3.1

killfile.c - regex_scan() - fixed bug which caused it to scan
	the first pattern on line multiple times, instead of
	scanning each pattern (added startline = tptr at end).

rpost.c - main() - added version nr printout to DEBUG3 stuff.

suck.c  - main() - added version nr printout to DEBUG2 stuff.

	- restart_yn() - added code to print error message if
		suck.restart exists, but suck.sorted doesn.t	

16 Nov 96 - Suck-3.3.2 released

--Changes in Suck-3.3.0

rpost.c - log_fail() - fix bug in sprintf(), remove /.

suck.c - get_message_index() - added code so that using
	a neg nr in sucknewsrc will allow you to download
	the last X nr of messages, handy for starting a 
	new group.

       - main() - check for NULLs on debug printout and
	handle gracefully

       - scan_args(), get_message_index() - added code
	to handle msnews.microsoft.com using 224 vice

	retval from read of result from child process
	  - killprg_closeit() - add nl to the sprintf
	so kill command is formatted correctly.

rpost.c - made all retvals use ENUM values

       - get_message_index(), allocnode(), do_supplemental()
		rewritten, now all they do is build a list

		way of deduping as building the list, and
		hopefully will speed up large message downloads.
       - get_message_index() - Added code to handle maxread
		parameter in sucknewsrc.  Added check for count
       		on group line, so if no messages available we
		don't even try.

suckutils.c - do_lockfile() - change so PMaster is passed so 
	can print to status log.  Change print of removing
	stale lock file from errlog to status log, since this

	  - get_articles() - added logcount, changed printf to make article file names
			     00XX-1666, where leading zeros are applied
	  - changed B_FALSE, B_INNXMIT, B_RNEWS to BATCH_ to avoid error on Sun compiler
	  - changed informational msgs to print to stdout vice stderr
	  - get_one_article() - created
	  - get_a_chunk()  - created
	  - send_a_message() - created
	  - get_articles() - moved all the stuff for one article to get_one_article()
			   - send_a_message() and get_a_chunk() and added killfile 
			   - processing stuff and ifdef KILLFILE stuff
	  - get_message_index() 
	    main()	   - moved handling of restart from get_articles() to main()

	  - do_dedupe()    - modified
	  - build_list()   - created
	  - get_articles() - added supplemental list processing, so user can specify
			   - additional article numbers to download, in addition
			   - to those from sucknewsrc.  This is so a user can specify
			   - articles that will NOT be checked against killfile stuff
			   - Now suck.sorted has two fields per line, msgnr and a
			   - one char field that states whether or not I must download
			   - this article. If I must, I will bypass killfile routines.
	
killfile.c  -
killfile.h  - created, contains stuff related to killfile processing

--Changes in 2.3B
Rewrote code to my code styles, this basically means: no global variables,
	single exit(), #define anything liable to change, change indentation.

both.c  - added full_path() so can put files anywhere, just change #defines in both.h.
	  added do_debug(), MyPerror() for easier debugging.
	  sgetline(), total rewrite so less character moving around
	  and handles partial lines, returns with the nl in buffer.
both.h  - clarifed debugging options.
	  centralized all #defines here for global changes
lpost.c  - just cosmetic changes, as I hope to phase this out.
Makefile - added a couple of comments
rpost.c  - rewrote to handle batch option
	   added do_article(), process one article
	   added do_batch(), loop thru batch file, process args
	   run filter as needed
	   added do_filter(), basically just fork() and execl()
suck.c   - main() rewrite to handle args
	   get_articles() rewritten to handle multifile output
	   added get_announcements() to move this out of main()
	   added do_dedupe() so no more system() calls.
	   added allocnode() for use by do_dedupe()
	   added checkdir() to check for and make directory
	   added do_innbatch() to build batch file of article file
	   names needed by innxmit
	   added do_rnewsbatch() to build file formatted for rnews
8 August 95 Suck2.3B released

--NEW MAINTAINER 3 July 1995 boby@pixi.com
Minor changes so no warning msgs from gcc2.7.0.
suck.c - if low=high, never got article, fixed 
suck.c - changed if lastread in sucknewsrc ==0 no get to == -1
3 July 1995 suck-2.2 released

--Changes in 2.2: 
Sgetline now cares for maxlen which means lines > 1024 bytes will
be folded. Lpost got the option -v to print some debugging output.
The other changes are only cosmetical :).

--Changes in 2.1.1:
Despite of the above proclamation i forgot to increase the buffer ;).
This is now fixed (hopefully). You see there is definately a need

rpost now more RFC0977 conform.
Renamed rpost.sh to blow.
Added another local posting script by huber@iamexwi.unibe.ch for inn.
