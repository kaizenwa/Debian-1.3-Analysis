	+ Misc cleanups.

	* host.h: Change signature of newHost to allow per-host
	streaming usage.

	* host.c: + Let the Host object dictate whether its
	  connections are streaming or not

	* endpoint.c: + Changed MAX_IOVEC to MAX_WRITEV_VEC due to class
	  with linux cpp symbol.
	+ Added a small sleep before abort() call.

	  sake of SVR4.

	* connection.c: + Changed a lot of ASSERTs to actually handle the
	  error condition instead of aborting.
	+ Catch a reject banner from nnrpd.
	+ Let the Host object dictate whether streaming
	  should be used or not.
