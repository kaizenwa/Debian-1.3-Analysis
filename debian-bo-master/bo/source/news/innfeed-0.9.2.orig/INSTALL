1.  Edit config.h as appropriate.

2.  Edit sysconfig.h. This is the file that tries to encapsulate all the
    system specifics.

2.  Edit the makefile to set compiler and warning flags etc.

3.  Make innfeed

3.1 If you get compile errors about UIO_MAXIOV in endpoint.c then:

	make check-maxiov

    and then edit the define for MAX_IOVEC in sysconfig.h to use the value
    displayed.

3.2 If you get run time log errors like 

	"failed to write command to remote: invalid argument" 

    then your MAX_IOVEC value is too big. Make check-maxiov to verify the
    number.

4.  Create the directory you defined in config.h as

		#define TAPE_DIRECTORY

5. Copy the innfeed.conf sample file to the location you gave in config.h as

		#define CONFIG_FILE

6. Edit innfeed.conf as appropriate for your peers.

7. For each peer, add an entry to the INN newsfeeds file that looks something
   like this:

	peername:groups+distributions\
		:Tm:innfeed!

   e.g.

	nic.near.net\
		:!junk/!local\
		:Tm:innfeed!

8. Add an entry like this too for the above entries to feed into.

	innfeed!:!*\
		:Tc,Wnm*\
		:/path/to/installed/innfeed -l /path/to/a/writable/logfile

9. Get innd to start it up (i.e. reload the newsfeeds file).

10. Apply the patch to innlog.awk included here--done by Christophe
    Wolfhugel <wolf@pasteur.fr>. The innfeed logging has changed
    a bit since he did this work, so it's not complete.

11. If innd writes a file called innfeed! in the out.going area of your
    spool, then the program procbatch.pl included here can be used to
    process it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to include Larry Wall's debugging version of malloc included
here (for testing purposes only--shouldn't need it otherwise), then in the
Makefile uncomment the "MALLOC = malloc.o" line and add the necessary '-I'
value to the INCDIRS variable definition (to point at the include
subdirectory of the inn source tree). At a pinch you could just rebuild
innfeed like this:

	make MALLOC=malloc.o INCDIRS=-I/usr/local/src/inn/include

The Makefile builds malloc.o in debugging mode--meaning it will cause a
core dump (into the top of your news spool) on certain malloc
failures. Remove the '-Ddebug' from the build line if you prefer to just
syslog any failures.
