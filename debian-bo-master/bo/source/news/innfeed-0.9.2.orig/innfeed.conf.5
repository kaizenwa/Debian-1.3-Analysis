.SH NAME
innfeed.conf \- configuration file for innfeed
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This man page describes the configuration file for version 0.9 (beta) of
innfeed.
.PP
The file 
.B innfeed.conf
is used to control the innfeed(1) program. It consists of a sequence of
lines; blanck lines and lines beginning with a number sign (``#'') are
ignored.
All other lines consist of a number of fields separated by colons. The
fields are, in order:
.PP
.RS
.nf
peer name                  string
ip name                    string or dotted quad
article timeout            integer or null
response timeout           integer or null
initial connections        integer or null
max connections            integer or null
max queue size             integer or null
streaming flag             boolean or null
low-pass lower-limit       real
low-pass upper-limit       real
port number                integer or null

.PP
For example:
.PP
.nf
  decwrl:news1.pa.dec.com:600:300:1:5:25:true:9.0:9.5:119
.fi
.PP
This entry says that:
.IP 1.
The peer's name is ``decwrl.'' This is the name INN uses to refer to it in
the newsfeeds file.
.IP 2.
It lives at the host named news1.pa.dec.com.
.IP 3.
If the link is idle for more than 600 seconds (that is there is no news
to be transferred) then the network connection will be torn down. 
.IP 4.
If the remote
machine doesn't respond to a command within 300 seconds then it is
considered dead and the connection is dropped. 
.IP 5.
One connection will be created initially.
.IP 6. 
Up to 5 connections will be run in parallel.
.IP 7.
Each connection will issue a maximum of 25 CHECK commands at once
(if the remote handles the streaming extension--if it doesn't this field is
ignored).
.IP 8.
Streaming is used when transmitting (if the remote supports it).
.IP 9.
If running in streaming mode, and running in no-CHECK mode (see #10 below),
then if less 90% of articles are accepted by the remote, then switch out of
no-CHECK mode. (i.e. start issuing CHECK commands again).
.IP 10.
If running in streaming mode, and if more than 95% of articles are
accepted, then go into no-CHECK mode. I.e. stop issuing CHECK commands and
only issue TAKETHIS commands.
.IP 9.
The port number on the remote host to talk to is 119.
.PP
An entry with a first field of "default" and an empty second field must be
specified first. The values from the third through last fields of this
entry are used to fill in missing fields from successive entries. For
example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
default::600:300:1:5:25:true:9.0:9.5:119

# All missing fields come from the default fields.
decwrl:news1.pa.dec.com

# The max connection field is specified, but all 
# others come from default entry.
uunet:news.uunet.uu.net::::10

# don't use streaming when talking to this peer.
data.ramona.vix.com:data.ramona.vix.com::::::false
