This file indicates how to setup slrnpull for pulling groups from a
news server.

0.  Build slrn and slrnpull.  Make sure you enable spool support and
    slrnpull support in slrnfeat.h.
    
        make 
	make slrnpull
	
    Now move slrnpull to somewhere on your path.
    
1.  Choose a directory that will be used for slrnpull.  In this file,
    I will assume it is /var/spool/slrnpull.
    
2.  Create the directory:

       mkdir /var/spool/slrnpull
       
3.  Create a file called `slrnpull.conf' in that directory.  Use the
    example provided in the slrn/slrnpull distribution as a template:
    
      cp ./slrnpull.conf /var/spool/slrnpull
      EDIT /var/spool/slrnpull/slrnpull.conf
      
    If your server requires authorization information, create a file called 
    `authinfo' in the slrnpull directory.  The file should consist of
    two lines: the first line should contain the username and the
    second should contain the password.
  
4.  Startup your network connection, e.g.,

      ppp-up

5.  Run slrnpull.

      slrnpull -d /var/spool/slrnpull -h YOUR.NNTP.NEWS.SERVER
   
6.  Stop your internet connection, e.g.,

      ppp-down
      
7.  Add the following lines to the end of your .slrnrc file (change
    accordingly):

       set spool_inn_root	"/var/spool/slrnpull"
       set spool_root		"/var/spool/slrnpull/news"
       set spool_nov_root	"/var/spool/slrnpull"
       set use_slrnpull 1
       set read_active 1
       hostname "YOUR_HOST_NAME"
       username "YOUR_USER_NAME"
       
8.  Now run slrn to read from this spool:

       slrn --spool
       
    (You can compile slrn so that it will read from the spool by
    default without the need to use the --spool command line option.
    See slrnfeat.h.)
