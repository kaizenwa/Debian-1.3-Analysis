To build slrn, first build the slang library.  Get it from
ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang.

Once the slang library has been created, change directories to the
[.src] subdirectory and do:

    $ @vmsmake
    
Hopefully this will automatically detect your compiler and TCPIP
package.  It also assumes the slrn directory is at the same level as
the slrn directory, i.e.,

    [.slrn]
    [.slrn.src]
    [.slang]
    [.slang.src]

After building slrn, you must do:

    $ slrn :== $device:[directory.of.slrn]slrn.exe
    $ define/job nntpserver news.server.name
    $ slrn -create -f jnews.rc
