% This file may be viewed on-line by SLRN by linking the environment variable
% SLRNHELP to it.  It is particlularly useful when you modify the default
% keybindings and you want the on-line help to reflect this fact.
%
% The format of the file is simple.  Lines that start with `%' are comment
% lines and will be ignored.  Also, any line that consists entirely of
% whitespace is also ignored.  All other lines are meaningful. 

% The file is divided into sections.  A section is started by the presence of
% a line that contains a name enclosed in brackets.  Currently, the only
% names formed in this manner are [Article] and [Group].  The text that
% follows one of these names will be displayed as the help screen for that 
% particular mode.
