Introduction
.PP
The two main log files in C news are
.Df log
.Df files log
.Df errlog
.Df files errlog
\fINEWSCTL\fP\fB/log\fR
and
\fINEWSCTL\fP\fB/errlog\fR,
which are the standard output and standard error streams
of
.I relaynews .
.Ix relaynews
.B errlog
should be empty;
if not,
something is seriously wrong,
probably with your configuration or
with unencapsulated news arriving mangled
courtesy of some network.

.B errlog
is a copy of any error messages written on
standard error by
.I relaynews
or its auxiliaries
(including control messages programs).
There are no timestamps
and the contents obey no special format.
A non-empty
.B errlog
is a sign of trouble,
which should be fixed promptly.
.PP
.B log
is written in a stylised format,
with whitespace separating the fields:
date and time, to millisecond resolution though possibly not
to millisecond accuracy;
the machine that sent us this article;
a single-character classification code;
the article's message-id;
and
code-specific information.
For example,
.DS L
.ft B
.ps 8

The classification codes are:
.TS
c | c | c
cfB | lw(2.75i) | l .
code	article disposition	code-specific information
_
\-	rejected	reason for rejection
+	accepted	list of sites to which this article was relayed
j	T{
accepted but filed in the \fIjunk\fR pseudo-newsgroup; preceding line will be \fB+\fR
T}	reason for junking
i	generated in response to an \fIihave\fR control message	list of sites to which this article was relayed
s	generated in response to a \fIsendme\fR control message	list of sites to which this article was relayed
.TE
.PP
Beware that control-message handlers inherit
.I relaynews 's
standard output, so if any of them natters on standard output
(we believe none of ours do), the nattering will appear in
.B log .
