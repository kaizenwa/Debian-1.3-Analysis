Background
.PP
A news replicator has two primary uses:
mirroring a news spool
(actually a news data base)
precisely onto other machine(s),
and
recovering one's lost news spool
from another's news spool
and a copy of one's old history file.

Mirroring

An option to
.I relaynews
(\c
.B \-g )
to
always
generate an
.B Xref:
header should suffice on the sending side.
The receiving side
needs another
.I relaynews
option
(\c
.B \-b
host)
to tell it to believe the contents of the
incoming
.B Xref:
line and to use those article numbers
(perhaps only if from the named host).

Restoring
.PP
Using some NNTP software,
say
.I nntpget ,
to grab the articles,
one needs a
.I relaynews
option
(\c
.B \-a
host)
to make it accept duplicate articles,
but file duplicates under the file names in the
.I history
file.
