.Ch "C News vs. VMS"
.PP
.Ix VMS
To run C News at all,
you need a fairly good emulation of Unix.
There are several such for VMS.
They have various minor imperfections.
The only one we specifically \fIknow\fR of that is a problem for
C News is the inability to make real links for cross-postings.
.Ix cross-posting
.PP
.Ix relaynews
\fIRelaynews\fR normally files an article under its first group and then
makes hard links into further groups.
If \fIrelaynews\fR finds itself unable to make a hard link,
it will try making a symbolic link instead;
if that fails, it will make a copy
(actually it minimises the number of copies).
.PP
.Ix expire
\fIExpire\fR has a \fB\-l\fR option that tells it to consider the first
name of an article as the ``leader'',
not to be deleted until all others
have been deleted.
.PP
The one place where extra work would be necessary would be \fImkhistory\fR,
.Ix mkhistory
which has no notion that some links are different from others.
.PP
So far as we know, we don't get into any of the other trouble areas of
Unix emulation on VMS,
at least with the Eunice emulator.
.Ix Eunice
We don't have a VMS handy for testing,
so we make no guarantees.
