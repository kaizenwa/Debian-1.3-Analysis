This is the New Improved C News Installation Guide.  It's in a bit of a
mess at present.

Everything here is set up to use the -ms macros.  No complex formatting
is attempted (other than tbl and a couple of pic diagrams), and only the
three standard fonts (R, I, B) are used.  Nothing here uses eqn.

stuff.  Note, in particular, that the Formatter Police are not going to

complicated or hard to read.  If you absolutely can't read anything
that isn't filled and justified, the awf text formatter (comp.sources.unix:

does a good job on most of our documentation (although it doesn't do tbl).

Ihave.pic.in is an illustration for ihave; ihave.pic is what you get after
you run ihave.pic.in through pic (in case you have a troff that knows about
the graphics commands but don't have pic).

flow.pic is an illustration for flow.pic.in; together they are used to
generate "flow", which is pic output.
