This is the "Australian readnews", written by Michael Rourke at UNSW,
extensively hacked for C News.  A number of simplifications have been
made, and some features deleted.

It's a simple and reasonably well-put-together news reader suitable for
giving to naive users who aren't going to be reading news much.

You may need to modify defs.h (although this isn't likely, any more).

Note that README.aus assumes you are installing the entire UNSW news
system, not just readnews.  Much of it is inapplicable or obsolete.
