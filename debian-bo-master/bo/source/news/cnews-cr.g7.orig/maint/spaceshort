# Newswatch runs this, with one argument, "y" if a space shortage exists
# and "n" if none does.  This is to permit easy local customizing for
# actions that should be taken when space is low (e.g., turning off input
# flow) and when it's no longer low (e.g., turning flow back on).  The
# install stuff will install this program only once, to make sure that
# local changes aren't overwritten.

# Any output is sent to report -u.

# Note that this program is run *whenever* newswatch is run, not just
# when the y/n status changes.  Whatever it does, it should be prepared
# to handle the possibility that the status hasn't changed since last time.
# If it runs for a long time (e.g., expire), it should be prepared to handle
# the possibility that there's another copy already running.
