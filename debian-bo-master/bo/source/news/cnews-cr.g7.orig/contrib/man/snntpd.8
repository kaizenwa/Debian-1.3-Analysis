.B snntpdwrap
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Snntpd
is a daemon to receive netnews by
the Network News Transfer Protocol
(RFC 977).
It accepts a small subset of NNTP commands, and
runs under
.IR inetd .
.I Snntpdwrap
is a wrapper shell script for older systems that have an
.I /etc/servers
file and cannot specify the uid of the daemon or options.
.PP
.I Snntpd
spools received articles as batches in
.IB NEWSARTS /in.coming;
the C News 
.I newsrun
program should be run by
.I cron
to process those batches frequently.
.I Snntpd
reports its errors to
.IB NEWSCTL /snntpdlog ,
if it exists
and is writable,
else to stderr.
.PP
If
.IB NEWSCTL /nntp.allow
exists,
the name of the remote system is looked up in it.
Host names must match exactly (modulo case distinctions)
and domains are specified by prepending a single dot.
If the name of the remote system is matched
(or if there is no
.B nntp.allow
file),
reception proceeds normally;
otherwise,
it is assumed that the remote system is attempting to read news
via NNTP,
has no access permission,
or has committed some other error,
so
.I nntpd
is
.IR exec ed
to deal with the situation.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Enable debugging.
Multiple
options may be given,
increasing the verbosity of the tracing.
.TP
.BR \-D " file"
Directs debugging to
.IR file .

.\".SH DIAGNOSTICS
.SH HISTORY
Written at the University of Toronto by Mark Moraes.
.SH BUGS
Doesn't support most of the NNTP protocol commands
(in fact only implements a subset of the V1 protocol).
This may be considered a feature.
.PP
Doesn't gratuitously whack off the high bit of each incoming byte.
(This violates the NNTP spec.;
how sad.)
Bytes are 8 bits.
Machines that keel over if the high bit is on should not run this code.
.PP
Doesn't limit the length of input lines.
This violates the suggested limit of 512 bytes.
