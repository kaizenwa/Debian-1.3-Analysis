Cleanup Release of C News, with patch CR.G			April 1995

The current C News distribution can be retrieved by anonymous FTP from
ftp.cs.toronto.edu (file pub/c-news/c-news.tar.Z) or ftp.zoo.toronto.edu
(file pub/cnews.tar.Z).  Please avoid major use of FTP during our peak
hours (0800-1800 Eastern time, zone -0500).  Major archive sites such as
ftp.uu.net and ftp.funet.fi also usually have the latest distribution.

See README.changes for what's new and wonderful, README.install for
installation instructions, README.etc for general notes.

Warning:  the documentation in doc/ is somewhat out of date.

We are grateful for financial support of C News development by the
following, none of whom are to blame for the final result (some more
detailed information can be found in the "sponsors" directory):

UUNET Communications Services Inc.	(provider of Usenet news feeds)
ClariNet Communications Corp.	(publisher of a Usenet-format E-newspaper)
