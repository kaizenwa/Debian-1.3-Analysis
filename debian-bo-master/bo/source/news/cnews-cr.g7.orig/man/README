These are the manual pages for C News proper; a few other pages for
auxiliary programs that you might want to install in their own right are
scattered here and there in other directories.

We have given up on providing a makefile that attempts to install these
pages.  There is too much variation in where and how they are stored.

These pages use the .TH macro in the following way:

	.TH <title> <chapter> "<date>"

The chapter argument now nominally carries a CN suffix, e.g. "8CN", but
not all the pages have been updated for that yet.

The only fonts used are the standard R, I, and B.

If you do not have nroff/troff, there are various ways of reading this

come and drag you away for reading the raw sources, which are not very
complicated or hard to read.  If you absolutely can't read anything
that isn't filled and justified, the awf text formatter (comp.sources.unix:

does a good job on most of our documentation.
