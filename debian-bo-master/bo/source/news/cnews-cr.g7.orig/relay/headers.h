/*
 * All the article header values worth retaining.
 * (strictly from headers in input.)
 *
 * All members of struct headers must point at malloced memory so that
 * freeheaders() can free it without having to keep track of what's
 * malloced and what's static.
 *
 * Furthermore, each member of headers must point at its own private copy
 * of its value string, for the above reason, and no code outside hdr*.c
 * may copy any member nor a modified copy of any member, though it may
 * copy the string pointed to by a (possibly modified) member.
 *
 * Perhaps C++ would allow this to be enforced by a strings class; too bad
 * it's picked up so much Simula baggage (refs, ptui!).  (See section 6.9
 * of The C++ Programming Language for a candidate class.)
