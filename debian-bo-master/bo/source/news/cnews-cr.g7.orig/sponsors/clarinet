ClariNet Communications Corp. publishes a full electronic newspaper
that comes as 300 read-only USENET style newsgroups.  We're pleased
to sponsor C News as it is an ideal transport engine for ClariNet's
special newsgroups.  ClariNet puts 4MB a day of _news_ into netnews.

ClariNet newsgroups contain:

	Live wireservice news from major wires such as the AP and Reuters.
	National, Local, International, Technical, Business, Sports,
		Market, Entertainment and Feature news.
	Daily computer industry news from Newsbytes.
	Graphics, including comic strips and editorial cartoons in
		MIME format.  (Featuring Dilbert)
	Syndicated columns, Press Releases, Internet information and more.

If you're running USENET software, ClariNet gives you newsgroups that
inform about the world -- an in particular the world of technology and
computers -- with in-depth coverage and the speed of electronic delivery.
What appears on ClariNet today will be in tomorrow morning's papers.

ClariNet makes news fit well into USENET format.  Articles all have
a meaningful Subject line (headline) written by a professional reporter.
ClariNet editors classify stories into multiple newsgroups so you can
follow what's new in your areas of interest every time you read netnews.

ClariNet is the oldest and most widely read provider of commercial
information to the USENET and Internet communities.  Our electronic
newspaper is (as of Sept 1994) read daily by over 70,000 people at
USENET sites.  ClariNet provides feeds over the internet via NNTP, or
via UUCP and other modem methods.  Once we authorize it, you can often
get your ClariNet feed from your USENET neighbours or feed hub -- many major
sites already subscribe.

ClariNet is inexpensive.  We work the internet way and charge a low, flat
monthly site-licence fee that lets everybody at your site read the news
as much as they want.  Costs are as low as $1/networker for corporations
and even less for schools and public-access sites (BBSs).
