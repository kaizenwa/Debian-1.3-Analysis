# Encodings control file.
# This file is consulted when a local posting contains 8-bit
# characters and no MIME header.
# Each line specifies for a certain group pattern:
# - the charset to use (assuming that given by the poster is OK)
# - the encoding to use
# See RFC1521 for details on these parameters.
# - a filter program to call for encoding. If this is missing,
#   inews' internal encoders are invoked (currently for Q-P only).
# First match counts!

# Groups		Charset		Encoding	Filter
# ------		-------		--------	------

# Example for internal filter
de.comp.standards	iso-8859-1	quoted-printable

# National hierarchies with charsets (8bit - don't filter)
de,fr			iso-8859-1	8bit
relcom			koi8-r		8bit
# The above assumes that users always use the right charset for
# postings in different hierarchies. If not, they have to supply their
# own MIME headers.

# Gatewayed BBS stuff (German)
maus,z-netz,t-netz	iso-8859-1	8bit

# Local hierarchies
ka,stgt			iso-8859-1	8bit

# Additional examples: Filter without adding MIME headers
# Somewhat unstable gateways here...
fido.ger,ger,gernet	-		-		iso2asc 2

# Filter but add MIME headers too
# foo.bar		iso-8859-1	x-rfc1345	iso2asc 4

# No default means 7 bit only.
