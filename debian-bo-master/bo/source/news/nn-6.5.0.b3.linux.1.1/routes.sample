# This file is read from the beginning until a match for a specific
# domain/site pair is found.  Initially all lines applies to all
# domains and hosts.  (NOTICE: we use domain == top-level domain)
#
# In the following list of requests, <host name> is the name of the
# LOCAL host, <domain> and <site> is the receivers domain and site.
#
#	/L <domain>	local domain name(s), implies /D <domain> command
#	/H <local host>	following lines only applies to specified local host
#	/H		following lines applies to all hosts
#	/N <site>	site is neighbour to local host (+prefix)
#	/D <domain>	following lines applies to specified domain only
#	/D		following lines applies to all domains
#	/P <prefix>	<prefix> is prefixed to the generated address
#	/B <pattern>	address to use for multi-hop bang addresses
#	/G <pattern>	default address pattern
#	<site> <pattern> address patterns used to reach given site
#
# The <domain>, <host>, and <site> specifications can be a comma-separated
# list of domain, host, or site names (without spaces).
#
# Address patterns are copied directly to the generated address, except
# that the following sequences are substituted:
#	%n	name of receiver
#	%s	receiver's site (with top-level domain stripped off)
#	%d	receiver's top-level domain
#	%b	first N-1 sites from N multi-hop bang address
#	%p	drop <preix> if one is specified
#	%%	a % character
#
# Default rules:
#	%n@local-host.local-domain -> %p%n
#	%n@neighbour-host.remote-domain -> %s.%d!%n
