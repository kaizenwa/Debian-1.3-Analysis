.SH NAME
nnsub \- subscribe to newsgroups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nnsub
[ \-v[0,1] ]  [ group ] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nnsub
subscribes to the supplied groups by updating your .newsrc file.
.LP
The groupnames can be entered either as program arguments or on
the standard input (one groupname per line).
.LP
If running with terminal control and verbosity 1 (see options)
.B nnsub
tries to find all newsgoup names which partially match the supplied
name if an exact match is not found. It then prints the count of
found matches and gives you the option to subscribe to all, to none or
to select groups via a menu in the same way as described below.
.LP
If a questionmark (\?) is given as groupname
.B nnsub
will start to present all (1000+) newsgroups in menu's of one screen.
One group per line preceeded by a letter resembling the selection menu
from
.B nn.
At each menu you are asked to enter a command closed by a NEWLINE.
Newgroups can be selected for subscription by including their preceding
(lower case) letter in the command. The presenting of the menu's can
be quitted by including a capital Q (for Quit) in the commandline. Also
recognized are B (=Bye), E (=End), R (=Resume) or X (=eXit). An empty
commandline will result in the prsenting of the next menu (or in quiting
the presenting of the menu's).
.LP
If running without terminal control or verbosity 0 partial name matching
is only performed if the supplied name starts and\/or ends with a dot (.).
All found matches will be subscribed to. A questionmark (\?) as groupname
will be ignored.

.TP
.B \-v1
The program tries to find newsgroups with partial name matching and
