 **********    nnsub Release 1.0 PL3  Jan 1992 ***************

This program nnsub is intended to make it easy to subscribe to newsgroups
if only a part of the name is known. If you don't know if the esperanto-group
is named "sci.lang.esperanto" or "soc.culture.esperanto" you can simply
type in "nnsub esperanto".

If running without NNTP (or on the nntp server) the program needs the
files /usr/lib/news/active and /usr/lib/news/newsgroups. The exact location
of these files can be changed via the #define-symbols ACTIVE and NEWSGROUPS.
The first draft version of the program was written and tested on a old micro
with CPM-80 with local copies of the files "active" and "newsgroups". The
later version which I first posted in "news.software.nn" was finished on a
Convex C210 with OS-8.1 (BSD-4.2/4.3). I expect it can easily adapted to
other machines.

If running on an nntp-client the symbol NNTP must be defined as the name
of the nntp-server. This version was developped, and works fine on a Sun
Sparcstation and a SUN 3/50.
This version undoubtly needs more pruning to adapt it to other systems.

For an extensive listing of the define-symbols and their meaning see
the comment in nnsub.c and the Makefile.

Success

I have compiled and run the program without problems on:
Convex C220 with ConvexOS-9.1 (a UNIX BSD variant)
SUN 3/50 and SUN Sparc with SunOS 4.1
Philips P9070 (a Motorola 68030 with ATT Unix SysV R3)
HP 9000-832S
