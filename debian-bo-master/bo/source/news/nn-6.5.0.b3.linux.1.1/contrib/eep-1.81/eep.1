.SH NAME
EEP! v1.8 -- Easy Editor Program for .newsrc files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eep [-p][-v]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Eep\^
is a user-friendly full-screen editor designed to 
modify the .newsrc file associated with the
.B rn
or
.B trn
news readers.  It is NOT intended to be used while the .newsrc
is currently open, i.e. by shelling out.  It may also work
with 
.B nn
but will currently not work if you read news via NNTP.
.P
EEP starts by building a list of newsgroups taken from the 
/usr/lib/news/active file, which is supplied with the `B' or `C'
news software.  This will be merged with descriptions taken 
from /usr/lib/news/newsgroups and /usr/lib/news/newslocal.
.P
EEP will then read the .newsrc file from the $HOME directory
of the user, and will display the list with a '+' sign marking
subscribed newsgroups.  (If $DOTDIR is defined, this will be 
used instead of $HOME).
.P
Curses is used to draw a list of the newsgroups, which may be
navigated using arrow keys as well as commands similar to the 
.B vi
editor.  Newsgroups which are currently subscribed to will be
prefixed with a ``+'' character, while those not subscribed to 
will have a SPACE.  If the newsgroup is invalid in same way, e.g.
it is bogus (not known in the active file) it will be marked with
a ``?''.  Pressing the 'i' key will show further information about 
the highlighted newsgroup, including its position in the file, low
and high message numbers, and whether it is active, inactive or
moderated.  Other commands allow the user to subscribe or
unsubscribe to newsgroups, delete them from their .newsrc
or catch up (mark all messages as read).
.P
If articles exist in the highlighted newsgroup, the `v' command
may be used to view a list of headers, allowing users to
browse through the messages (but not the message text.)
.P
After certain commands, the cursor will automatically advance to
the next or previous newsgroup, depending upon the direction of
travel, as indicated with the most recent up or down movement.
.P
.SH
COMMANDS
.P
Here is a summary of commands available (upper and lower case
letters are treated the same.)  Note that some commands have more
than one character to activate them, to offer variety of choice.

Searching
.P
There are two styles of searching, 
.B vi
and
.B emacs.
.PP
.B vi
style searching will occur in the direction of the last cursor movement 
(default downwards.)  Searching for a null string will repeat the
last search, which is identical to the 'n' command.
.PP
.B emacs
style searching will go forwards or backwards, depending upon the command.
Terminate the search with ESCAPE, and use backspace to erase the last
character in the search string.  Pressing ^S or ^R again will repeat the
last search.

faster at low modem speeds when moving through the file.

.B "  -v"
Verbose mode will tell you more about EEP during startup.

.SH WARNINGS
Your existing .newsrc will be renamed to .oldnewsrc, deleting any
existing file of that name.  This will occur only when you exit with
the
.B "``x''"
command.  Until then,
.B "eep's"
working file is .newsrc.eep.
.P
New newsgroups will not automatically be notified.  Newsgroups 
which are not present in your .newsrc file, but are found in the
active file, will be sorted to the bottom of the list.
.P
When moving a set of newsgroups with the mark and move commands,
the set will not necessarily stay in the same relative order.
.P
Bogus newsgroups (those not found in the active file, but present
in your .newsrc) will be (optionally) deleted.  Deleting newsgroups
is pointless, because if they're in the active file, then they will
automatically be added in next time you run 
.B eep.
.P
When subscribing or marking the first or last newsgroups, and
the direction of movement would not move the cursor, the line
is not updated as it should be.
