1.  Editing descriptions

When we change a description in the list (as a root user, or someone
with write privilege over the file containing the newsgroup descriptions), 
we should optionally write over this file with our changes.  NOW, this
would be easier if there was only one such file, but there are two.
So for each description, we must keep a flag to say which file it came
from, then only write over *that* file with the descriptions that came
from it.  This will allow a local user to edit their own NEWSLOCAL file.

2.  Sliding left and right

The left and right keys should allow us to pan left and right, to reveal
more of the description or newsgroup name.  When moved, the current
settings should remain in force.  This code should also permit eepcolumns 
to control how wide the lines are displayed, which will depend upon curses,
of course.  Note that this should be set to sensible values if SIGWINCH
resizes a window dramatically.
