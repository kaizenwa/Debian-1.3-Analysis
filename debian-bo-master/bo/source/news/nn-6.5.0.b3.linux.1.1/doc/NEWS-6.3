Description of new features (in mixed order):
---------------------------------------------

NNTP support has been added (thanks to Rene Seindal @ diku.dk).

Online manual.

Regular expression search in reading mode:  / and .

Regular expression matching for subjects in -s/ option and G=/ command.

Articles can be saved in a mail compatible format by setting the
mail-format variable.

The article selection save files are now kept in network format if
NETWORK_DATABASE is defined, so reading news from different machines
should now work in a heterogeneous environment.

Added $F which expands to the group name with / instead of .  E.g. $F
in rec.music.synth produces rec/music/synth

Folder name "+" is expanded to the file name found in the new
default-save-file variable (default +$F).

When saving articles, the prompting for a file name can be disabled by
setting the quick-save variable (saving will be done in the default
save file).

nn will ask for confirmation before appending to existing files when
confirm-append is set.

The message after each save can be disabled by unsetting the
save-report variable.

The manual has been corrected to use the proper names for the
mail-record and news-record variables.

:unshar will create the directory if is does not exist.

Customized article header presentation through setting of header-lines
variable.

Complete variable settings are now shown by :set

Full macro support - you can now bind any sequence of commands to a
single key (see the define command).

Individual articles in a folder can now be cancelled!  I.e. folders
are now fully supported:  you can save, print, respond to, and cancel
separate articles in the folders created by nn. (Try the G +folder command).

A global init file is now supported rather than just a global sequence file.
(You should avoid using the sequence file, because it might go away in
a future release.)

Nn will now remember which articles you have seen on the menu (but not
necessarily selected) when you quit.  Confirming the question "use old
selections" now also implies that nn will start on the same menu page
as the one you quitted on.

There is a retry-on-error variable which can be set to a number of
times attempts to open an article should be done before giving up.

You can now specify per group default save files in the init file (in
the group sequence).

S+ is an addition to the old S* command which saves all the selected
articles in the group!

When you have given a command that clears the screen, the screen is
now redrawn by default when the command terminates.  To get the 6.1
behaviour (prompt for a new : command), you must set the delay-redraw
variable.

When input completion is possible, you can now use the ? key to get a
list of the possible completions.

Completion is now possible when entering an extended command
(:command) - both for the command name itself and the arguments.
(The only exception is when entering the VALUE of a variable.)

The 'backup' variable now works "the right way": It makes a backup of
the rc file on start-up.  nn can then update the rc file after reading
each group (increased security), and still restore the old rc file
with the :q! command.  The backup variable is now set by default.

You can set the 'mail' variable to make nn check for the arrival of
mail, and you can use the ':rmail' command to read the mail!  (But it
is not a full mail interface, e.g. you cannot delete messages, cc:
fields are not supported if you reply to a message, etc.)

nn will now synchronize with the .newsrc file if the "newsrc" variable
is set.  However, it does NOT understand about individual articles
that are marked as unread (e.g. 5-8 in 1-4,9-24) - it will silently
mark such articles as read (e.g. read the above as 1-24).
  I don't know anybody who uses this, but if somebody wants to improve
on it, feel free to do it.  If you just want to to use rn from time to
time, the current support will be sufficient if you always read all
the articles in a group once you have started reading it (or you read
the articles in the normal article number order).

When saving an article with a full or partial header in a folder,
legal article header lines in the body of the article are now
escaped with a tilde, e.g. ~From: ....., to avoid having the
articles split improperly when the folder is later opened by nn.

There is a new C)onf command to nnadmin to print the current
configuration (directories, files, network, etc.).

The G (goto-group) command now allows you to jump to an unread group
in the group sequence without entering a new recursive menu level.

The manual nn.1 has been clarified regarding the effect of options:
The init file is read prior to parsing the options, and the options
will TOGGLE the CURRENT value of boolean variables.


Removed backwards compatibility
-------------------------------

Support for upgrading from release 3, 4, or 5 has been removed, since
the sites using these releases have all updated to 6.1.

Also the support for pre 2.11 news has been removed (OLD_NEWS).
