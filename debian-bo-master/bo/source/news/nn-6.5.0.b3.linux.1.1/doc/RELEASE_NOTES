Known problems in release 6.4
-----------------------------

Prog:	nnmaster - nntp
Title:	nnmaster may hang if nntp server dies.
From:	Rene Seindal <seindal@diku.dk>

	Keep-alive must be set on the nntp socket to be able to notify
	the nnmaster that the server has died (via sigpipe).

Prog:	nn
Title:	G= in merged groups

	When searching for a subject or author in a merged group using
	G = .... only the group of the most recently accessed article
	is searched.

Prog:	nnmaster
Title:	initial collection of news should use get_article_list

	Explicitly requesting all articles in the range min..last is
	wasteful.  A better method would be to use the get_article_list
	method used by expire method 1.

Prog:	stdio
Title:	handling of network errors

		stdio is not well suited to handle network problems, and it is
	known to be slow as well.  A replacement is needed.
	
Prog:	aux.sh
Title:	RECMAIL must work

	If the RECMAIL fails for some reason, the user is told so via
	mail - using RECMAIL.  It is checked during installation that
	the RECMAIL program exists, but not that it works.

Prog:	nnmaster
Title:	Changes to GROUPS file should be detected automatically

	It shouldn't be necessary to stop the master, run nnmaster -G,
	and restart the master if GROUPS is changed.

Prog:	nn
Title:	.newsrc and select line length limited to 8k

	There shouldn't be any limit on the length of lines in these
	files.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Cannot reload init file

	It should be possible to reload the init file or other files
	to have variable settings and presentation sequence on the
	fly.
	
Prog:	nn
Title:	macro syntax and init file differs

	The syntax of macros shouldn't differ from the normal init
	file syntax.

Prog:	nn
Title:	The confirm-entry function is done after menu collection

	It should be done before spending time on collecting the menu.

Prog:	database
Title:	keywords and summary are not stored in the database

	Kill/select is not possible on keywords or summary, since they
	are not in the database.  The summary could also be used on
	the menu to annontate articles with identical subjects.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Cannot follow thread in References: line

	This is one of the major new facilities planned for 7.0.
	
Prog:	nn
Title:	Cannot go to "previous article" if it was in another group.

	A "history menu" is planned for rel. 7.0 to overcome this.


Prog:	nn - menu
Title:	The , and / keys should scroll the menu rather than wrap around

	It would be more logical that way.

Prog:	nn - options
Title:	The -s and -n options cannot be combined.
	
	It could be useful to search for a specific subject from
	a specific sender.
	
Prog:	nn - mail-format
Title:	The "From " line could be more informative in mail-folders.

	It should contain the poster's name rather than the group's
	name.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Should look for more news before exiting.

	News which has arrived in already read groups during news
	reading is not seen until the next invocation of nn.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Shell layers are not supported.

	^Z is eaten by nn so shell layers don't work.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Init file processing writes to string constant.
From:	Sean Casey <sean@ms.uky.edu>
	David Heath <dave@boingo.med.jhu.edu>
Fixed:	Patch #1 [init.c]

	If one doesn't use "-fwritable-strings" with gcc, nnadmin core
	dumps because of some code in the process init file section.
	It tries to write to the string "init,", which may be in the
	text segment.

Prog:	nnmaster
Title:	nnmaster -l always quits.
From:	Sean Casey <sean@ms.uky.edu>
	David Heath <dave@boingo.med.jhu.edu>
	syd@dsinc.dsi.com (Syd Weinstein)
Fixed:	Patch #1 [master.c]

	Anytime I give the -l flag to nnmaster, it quits with:
		E: May  7 15:05 (M): Incomplete MASTER file

Prog:	nnmaster
Title:	Database inconsistency always reported for some groups
From:	syd@dsinc.dsi.com (Syd Weinstein)
Fixed:	Patch #1 [admin.c collect.c]

	Some groups always reports inconsistencies even after recollection.
	(It turns out that if the highest numbered article(s) in a group does
	not exist, the validation of the index fails, and furthermore, if
	only non-existing articles are "collected" in a group by nnmaster,
	the group header is not saved in the database.  ++Kim)
	
Prog:	nn
Title:	Unsubscribed groups can interfere with merged groups.
From:	Robert.Stockton@ELROND.GANDALF.CS.CMU.EDU
Fixed:	Patch #1 [sequence.c]

	Unsubscribed groups foul up merging of the form "foo*,".  The
	"Next Group" command may show you some of the merged groups again.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Remapping keys may interfere with Junk command.
From:	Robert.Stockton@ELROND.GANDALF.CS.CMU.EDU
Fixed:	Patch #3 [init.c keymap.c keymap.h group.c menu.c]
	(The fix involves a "shadow" keymap for the menu map keys bound to
	a macro.  The shadow binding is shown by :show map menu, ++Kim).
	
	Menu mode macros are invoked when the appropriate keystrokes are used
	in the Junk command.  For example, when I rebound 'N' in menu mode to
	a macro, it interfered with Junking of "Leave-Next" articles.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Y (overview) in "nn -X" mode doesn't show unsubscribed groups.
Fixed:	Patch #1 [group.c]

	"nn -X" includes unsubscribed groups in the sequence, but they are
	not shown on the group overview.

Prog:	aux
Title:	'y' response to Abort? is not recognized
From:	Mark Nagel <nagel@ics.UCI.EDU>
Fixed:	Patch #1 [aux.sh]

	If you try to abort a posting, and you actually type 'y' and
	return, it doesn't work.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Cannot set "included-mark" to blanks
From:	beldar@mips.com (Gardner Cohen)
Fixed:	Patch #1 [init.c] -- need to put \ before first space.

	My preferred indented prefix is three blanks, which I haven't been
	able to set in my init in the past (is it possible now?).

Prog:	manuals
Title:	Some lines are ignored
From:	Peter Andersen <datpete@daimi.dk>
Fixed:	Patch #1 [nn.1 nnmaster.8]

	Some text lines in the manuals contain a period at the beginning
	of a line; this is mis-interpreted as an nroff command.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Escape codes are always turned into ^[ form.
From:	Piet Beertema <piet@cwi.nl>
Fixed:	Patch #1 [more.c variable.c nn.1] -- new trusted-escape-codes var.

	I encountered problems with both rn and nn, which wouldn't properly
	display in kanji: the ESC char was "escaped", i.e. displayed as ^[
	But kanji encoding uses the ESC, so escaping them obviously messes up
	things.	 [You must fix inews also - it normally discards ESC]

Prog:	nn
Title:	Bug in generation of message-id line
From:	Pekka Kyt|laakso <netmgr@csc.fi>  + fix
Fixed:	Patch #1 [answer.c]

	user_name is "called" without ().

Prog:	nn
Title:	G command may leave group "active".
From:	Greg Onufer <exodus@cherrs2.Eng.Sun.COM>
	Scott Boyd <scott@Futures.COM>
Fixed:	Patch #1 [group.c]
	
	G group @ with no archive file leaved group active.
	group-group command fails with "groupname is an active group" on
	2nd attempt, if no articles were found on 1st attempt.

Prog:	nngrab
Title:	nngrab uses egrep -i
From:	pete@eleazar.dartmouth.edu (Pete Schmitt)
Fixed:	Patch #1 [articles.c nngrab.sh]

	nngrab uses egrep with a -i option.  This option is only valid for
	grep and fgrep on BSD 4.3 -- i.e. it is not portable.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Folder subarticles span to end of file (only NNTP).
From:	Robert.Stockton@ELROND.GANDALF.CS.CMU.EDU
Fixed:	Patch #1 [news.c]

	When you use the 'G' command to view an article in a folder, it shows
	you the entire contents of the folder from that point rather than the
	single article requested.  (This only happens with NNTP  ++Kim)

Prog:	nn
Title:	help commands shows wrong info for new commands
From:	netmgr@csc.FI (Pekka Kytolaakso)
Fixed:	Patch #1 [help.commands]

	There's an error in the file help commands. It still uses 'L' as the
	'change layout' key (in selection mode) and dosn't say anything about
	the news use of the L key.

Prog:	nnmaster - nntp_get_active
Title:	Groups may be removed from database due to disk full.
From:	KFS
Fixed:	Patch #1 [nntp.c]

	If the disk runs full while the active file is fetched from an nntp
	server, the incomplete active file is believed to be the complete
	active file.  This causes nnmaster to remove the groups which didn't
	get written to the active file.

Prog:	xmakefile
Title:	BSD make chokes on || form
From:	Paul Pomes <paul@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu>
	pete@eleazar.dartmouth.edu (Pete Schmitt)
Fixed:	Patch #2 [xmakefile]

	If man/nn.1 exists, then the [ ! -f man/nn.1 ] test exits non-zero.
	To prevent BSD make from choking on this, the test command should be
	prefixed with a '-' to have make ignore the non-zero status.

Prog:	inst
Title:	test -w cannot test directories
From:	Paul Pomes <paul@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu>
	Mark Nagel <nagel@wintermute.ICS.UCI.EDU>
Fixed:	Patch #2 [inst.sh -- omitted the check]

	In the inst.sh script, a check is made whether a directory is write-
	able by using test -w man/.  On BSD systems, this test applies only
	to files and not directories so it always fails.

Prog:	nnmaster
Title:	TERM signal not handled properly
From:	Paul Pomes <paul@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu>
Status:	I cannot reproduce this problem!
	
	When nnmaster is sent a TERM signal, it does not remove the MPID
	file.  The next invocation of nnmaster complains that nnmaster is
	already running, removes the MPID file, and then exits.  The next
	invocation will then succeed.

Prog:	nn
Title:	G to unknown group dumps core.
From:	dean@coplex.UUCP (Dean Brooks)
Fixed:	Patch #2 [group.c]

	NN 6.4.1 will dump core on our machine if you use the "G"
	command to go to a group that doesn't exist.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Start-up error messages disappears (xterm)
From:	jaap@sequent.uucp (Jaap Vermeulen)

	Error messages at startup time of 'nn' are unreadable (no time to
	read them :-) and in an xterm written in the alternate screen.

Prog:	nn - xterm
Title:	Mail command does not work well with xterm
From:	Jaap Vermeulen <jaap@sequent.uucp>

	I'm in menu mode, I 'M'ail an article, I do not edit it.
	When it mails nn reverts to the alternate screen (xterm) when done I
	lost the menu information, the only thing that gets redrawn is the
	status line (i.e. I end up with an emptry screen except for the
	status line). A ^L will fix this, of course.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Interrupt char doesn't work (CBREAK/DYNIX)
From:	Jaap Vermeulen <jaap@sequent.uucp> + fix
Fixed:	Patch #3 [term.c global.c s-dynix3-0.h s-template.h]

	Interrupt (^C) does not work. ^G does work.
	'stty' tells me I'm really using interrupt (^C).
	(Problem is that SV_INTERRUPT is not defined on DYNIX, ++Kim)

Prog:	nn
Title:	y=YES n=NO is displayed to late
From:	Jaap Vermeulen <jaap@sequent.uucp>
Fixed:	Patch #2 [term.c]

	"y=YES n=NO" help is displayed too late on some systems (no flush).

Prog:	config.h
Title:	CLIENT_DIRECTORY overrides LIB_DIRECTORY
From:	Jaap Vermeulen <jaap@sequent.uucp>
Fixed:	Patch #2 [global.c]
	
	When I change CLIENT_DIRECTORY, LIB_DIRECTORY is also changed to
	CLIENT_DIRECTORY, which is, I assume, not the correct behavior.

Prog:	nn
Title:	G folder ... N dumps core
From:	Robert.Stockton@ELROND.GANDALF.CS.CMU.EDU + fix
	"Jason Molenda" <molenda@s1.msi.umn.edu>
	dean@coplex.uucp (Dean Brooks)
	olson%anchor.esd@sgi.com (Dave Olson)
Fixed:	Patch #2 [group.c]

	After installing patch 1 for 6.4 I get core dumps after reading
	folders.

Prog:	nn
Title:	First 'B' after startup will crash nn
From:	Jaap Vermeulen <jaap%sequent@relay.EU.net>
Fixed:	Patch #2 [group.c]

	Start nn, hit 'B', segmentation violation....

Prog:	nnmaster - expire
Title:	Expire may dump core if first group in active is empty. + fix
From:	olson%anchor.esd@sgi.com (Dave Olson)
Fixed:	Patch #2 [nntp.c]

	When using nntp, if the first group checked contains no articles, then
	art is still a null pointer, so the attempt to set *art = 0; causes a
	core dump on systems that don't allow de-referencing a null pointer.

Prog:	config.h
Title:	NNTP_SERVER must be full path is mini-inews is built + fix
From:	olson%anchor.esd@sgi.com (Dave Olson)
Fixed:	Patch #2 [config.h-dist]

	For config.h, when inews is going to built, one MUST use a full path
	for NNTP_SERVER define, or inews will not be able to find the file.

Prog:	nnmaster
Title:	Database gets corrupted
From:	olson%anchor.esd@sgi.com (Dave Olson)

	First, the database seems to be getting corrupted quite often.  I get
	errors like this in the Log.  (nntp is used)
	  E: May 11 14:57 (olson): sgi.bugs.aspen: data inconsistency
	I am running nnmaster -r15 -C -e -E1 (and with -l on patch #1).

Prog:	nn
Title:	Group is marked read if database is corrupted
From:	olson%anchor.esd@sgi.com (Dave Olson)
Fixed:	Patch #2 [group.c]

	... when this happens, nn marks the group as read, which would seem
	to me to be the wrong thing to do.

Fixed:	Patch #2 [man/*]

	nncheck manual still mentions .nn/rc
	nnquery is still mentioned in many manuals
	nnpost & nngrab is missing in most See Also sections

Prog:	aux
Title:	posting via Cnews' inews; output considered an error
From:	Mark Nagel <nagel@wintermute.ICS.UCI.EDU>

	Sometimes inews may produce valid output, e.g. when postings to a
	moderated group is converted to mail.  However, output from inews
	is always considered to imply failure to post.

Prog:	nn
Title:	append-signature-post not honoured
From:	leo@aai.uucp
Fixed:	Patch #2 [aux.sh]

	I have noticed some inconsistencies about when I am asked whether to
	include my .sig or not depending on whether I'm posting, following
	up, or mailing.

Prog:	manuals
Title:	Spelling mistakes
From:	olson%anchor.esd@sgi.com (Dave Olson)
Fixed:	Patch #2 [man/*]

	Dave provided a lot of corrections to the spelling.

	Chuq Von Rospach <chuq@Apple.COM>
	Jaap Vermeulen <jaap%sequent@relay.EU.net>
Fixed:	Patch #3 [newsrc.c]

	When keep_unsubscribed is false, unsubscribing to the last presented
	group has no effect (it is not saved in .newsrc.)

From:	James A. Woods <jaw@riacs.edu>
Fixed:	Patch #3 [nngrab.sh nngrab.1 (new -c option)]

	Removing the -i option on egrep and folding the subjects database
	to lowercase (patch #2) breaks a command like "nngrab NeXT".

Fixed:	Patch #3 [save.c group.c variable.c nn.1 -- new folder-save-file]

	Say you have a folder of +alt.sources then the default save file is

Title:	May dump core if saving to pipe and command fails.

Title:	Unmark does not clear standout mode on HP terminals
From:	Bill Gaines <bill%iccdev@relay.EU.net>
	Hellmuth Michaelis <hm@hcshh.uucp> + fix
Fixed:	Patch #10 [term.c]

	On HP terminals, if you mark an article, and then unmark it, the

Fixed:	Patch #13 [master.c s-template.h]

	Problem is that sleep() call is not based on SIGALRM, and thus cannot
	be terminated by that.  The fix provides a replacement for sleep if
	HAVE_HARD_SLEEP is defined in the system's s- file.

Title:	Accounting data are garbled on SUN4.
From:	jhb@maths.su.oz.au (John Brownie) + fix

	There is some kind of structure alignment problem on the SUN-4 which
	may give strange results... Compiling with -misalign fixes this.

Title:	multi-keys are not reliably recognized via rlogin sessions.
From:	marius@rhi.hi.is (Marius Olafsson) + fix (not used directly)
Fixed:	Patch #13 [term.c variable.c nn.1 + several s- files]

	The basic keyboard handling has been rewritten to make input parsing
	cleaner and more reliable.  The new code will also preserve partial
	multi-key sequences for use as normal input (the old code only
	preserved the first character).  There is also a new variable named
	"multi-key-guard-time" to control the "between characters" timeout.

Title:	TCSETAF is broken on pty's on many sysV systems and AIX
From:	andy@xwkg.icom.com (Andrew H. Marrinson) + fix
	marius@rhi.hi.is (Marius Olafsson) + fix
Fixed:	Patch #13 [term.c]

	When rlogin'ed into some systems, the TCSETAF used to switch to and
	from raw mode will incorrectly flush OUTPUT as well as input.  The
	workaround is to use TCSETAW which will not flush input.  This
	changes the behaviour of nn when using TERMIO and flow-control is
	set: before nn would flush input after redrawing each menu or article
	page - this is no longer done (which is probably better anyway!)

Prog:	nnmaster
Title:	GROUPS and MASTER files are out of sync
From:	lupe@alanya.Germany.Sun.COM (Lupe Christoph)
Fixed:	Patch #13 [db.c global.c master.c]

	The GROUPS file is now rewritten rather than simply appended to when
	new groups are added to the database.  I'm not sure this really fixes
	the problems, but at least it will take care of the situation where
	the GROUPS file contains some trailing garbage (maybe left over from
	a system crash).

From:	KFS on request from Peter Andersen

	least a .newsrc file which can be used to guess which groups are NEW.
	This information is now used even when new-groups-action == 3 or 4
	for new nn users (without a LAST file); before all groups not in

	the top of the screen.	If > 0, then nn will scroll the last
	"s-l-l" lines of the article (and display the rest as usual).

Title:	Stricter splitting of folders and mail boxes.
From:	bernd@bhpcpd.kembla.oz.au (Bernd Wechner) & KFS
Added:	Patch #11 [folder.c digest.c variable.c]

	Folders are now split according to the format of the first article in
	the folder, i.e. a folder is now either in "standard", "UNIX mail",
	or MMDF format, and it is no longer possible to have "mixed" folders.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Existing folders are now scanned to determine the proper format for
	saved articles (unless the variable 'folder-format-check' is unset.)
From:	KFS
Added:	Patch #11 [save.c variable.c]

	This means that the variables 'mail-format' and 'mmdf-format'
	are only used to determine the format of new folders, or if
	'folder-format-check' is off (if you know only one format is used).

Prog:	nn
Title:	Improved rewriting of folders and mail boxes.
From:	bernd@bhpcpd.kembla.oz.au (Bernd Wechner) & KFS
Added:	Patch #11 [folder.c global.c variable.c]

	The backup folder is now located in the .nn directory (there is a new
	variable backup-folder-path to control this), and a folder can now be
	rewritten even if the directory is read only.  The backup folder is
	retained if the keep-backup-folder variable is set.  A trace of the
	compression process is now shown if trace-folder-packing is set.

Prog:	nn
Title:	Several new "on condition" constructs and other init file goodies.
From:	KFS (following several requests for rather specific features).
Added:	Patch #12 [init.c nn.1]

	Instead of a steady flow of requests for new controls in the init
	file I decided to take a more generic approach and provide the
	following new commands and conditionals in the init file.  See
	the manual for more details.
	    on [ test ]
	    on `shell command` str1 str2 ...
	    on `` str1 str2 ...
	    on !shell command
	    on $VAR [ str1 str2 ... ]
	    else
	    echo MESSAGE
	    error MESSAGE
	    exit [ n ]
	    stop
	    chain alternative-init-file

Prog:	nn
Title:	nn can now enter the group that was active the last time nn was quit.
From:	KFS on many requests
Added:	Patch #12 [nn.c variable.c]

	There is a new variable 'enter-last-read-mode' to control this:
	0: never enter the last group read,
	1: ask to enter group if it has unread articles, else don't enter,
	2: ask to enter group even if no unread,
	3: enter unconditionally if unread articles, else don't enter,
	4: enter uncond even if no unread.
	If there are no unread articles, nn will actually locate the next
	group in the sequence starting with the remembered group.

Title:	New "on first-use" construction to allow special actions for first
	time users of nn (must be placed in global init file).
From:	KFS on request from Michael Rawdon <rawdon@rex.cs.tulane.edu>
Added:	Patch #13 [init.c nn.c]
	
	on first-use [all]	 For all new users of nn (no ~/.nn)
	on first-use new	 For new news readers (no .newsrc)
	on first-use old	 For old news readers (have .newsrc)

	To avoid adding missing groups to .newsrc on first invocation of nn
	for a "convert" user, place this in the global init file:
		on first-use old
			set new-group-action 0
		end

Prog:	nn
Title:	New integer variable: check-db-update-time.  If non-zero, nn will
	give a warning check if database has not been updated by nnmaster
