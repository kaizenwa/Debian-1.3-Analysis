Ideas for people looking for things to do...

The groups menu code is not getting very far.  Any volunteers who have
more spare time to work on this than me?

The consolidated menus mode does not work on the merged metagroup
display.

The menu code is a mess... It needs a cleanup...

NNTP 1.6's clientlib and mini-inews have already been implemented, they
will be posted as patch #20,#21, etc due to the size of the changes.

The function protos need more work.  There are still a lot of externs
floating around in there.  The static and global data is still
accessed and defined all over the place.

There are 799 odd goto's in there... Must be a world record... :-)

real threads, etc.  I have an idea on this.  Perhaps trace the Xref:
lines more closely when doing subject matching in article_equal.

The docs are out of sync in a few places.

Everybody that finds their patches installed, please see if a manual
entry/adjustment is needed.
