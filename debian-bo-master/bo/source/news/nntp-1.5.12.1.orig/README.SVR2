To make NNTP run on SYSV Release 2 or earlier, do the following:

1. Get the Berkeley Directory Library emulation package. You can get it
from ftp.academ.com in /pub/nntp1.5/ndir.shar. This is the so-called NDIR 
package. Install it. (If you don't know if you have it, look for the
file ndir.h in /usr/include. If it is there, you have the NDIR library
and can move on the step 2.)

2. Edit conf.h.  Make sure you define USG and look at all the other
stuff in there to be sure you have defined all the other things you
need. (You will most likely need to define U_LONG, ALONE, vfork, and
FAKESYSLOG. You will most likely need to undefine FASTFORK, BSD_42,
DBM, SUBNET, NETMASK, DAMAGED_NETMASK, and DECNET.) You will probably
need to undefine SYSLOG if you don't define FAKESYSLOG.

3. Edit the Makefile in the root directory of the nntp sources.  Make sure to
add -lndir to the LIBS line. If you have EXCELAN, you will probably need to
add a -lsocket here aswell. If the networking include files are not in the
"standard location" (e.g. /usr/include), be sure to modify the CFLAGS lines to
add -Ilocation_of_the_network_include_files.

4. Now, you can cd to the root directory of the nntp sources and type
"make server" to make the server programs.

If you have problems, send mail to nntp@academ.edu and he will help if he
can.
