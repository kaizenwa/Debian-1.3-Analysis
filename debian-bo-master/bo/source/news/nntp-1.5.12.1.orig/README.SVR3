 How to configure for System V.3
 
 1.  Define USG.
 
 2.  If your System V.3 system has sockets, it will probably compile fine.
     Just be sure you have the sockets library in the Makefile LIBS line.

 3. If your System V.3 does not have sockets, read the README.SVR4 file
    and follow the instructions there.
