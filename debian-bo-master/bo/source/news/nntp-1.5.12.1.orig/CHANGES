    This file describes the changes which have been made in NNTP
since the initial release.  Individuals who either reported the bug or
inspired the bug fix are in square brackets.

1.5.12.1 Added a couple of small changes in remote.c and nntpxfer.c to
	accomodate differences in OSF/1 and BSD_44. [sob@academ.com]

	Fixed a typo in misc.c for BSDI [sms@WLV.IIPO.GTEGSC.COM]

1.5.12  Removed client software. Get the client kit from
	ftp.academ.com. Reorganized the source tree to accomodate
	this change. [Wayne Davison <davison@borland.com>]

	Changed "NNTP-Posting-Host:" line to "X-NNTP-POSTING-HOST" to be
	in line with RFC 822.

	Added code to remove any previous versions of NNTP-POSTING-HOST or
	X-NNTP-POSTING-HOST that may have been provided by the client software.

	Added support for AUTHINFO GENERIC.

	Updated README.IRIX to reflect changes for IRIX 5.X.

	Changed the name of README.SYSV to README.SVR2.

	Added support for System V Release 4. Added SVR4 variable
	to conf.h-dist. 

	Added support for BSD 4.4-lite. Added BSD_44 variable to
	conf.h-dist and set that as the default.

	Deleted mkgrdates and added acttimes in support directory.
	Deleted mkgrdates man page and added acttimes man page.
	[Wayne Davison <davison@borland.com>]

	Added the XOVER command to the server.  The XOVER command
	is used to retrieve data from the .overview file that is part
	of Geoff Collyer's "nov" package (that package is not provided
	here; the official archive for it is
	world.std.com:pub/src/news/nov.dist.tar.Z).  This command
	has the following syntax:
		XOVER [first[-last]]
	Where first and last are article numbers; the default is to
	return data for the current article.  This command is only
	valid after a GROUP command.  It returns a 224 code followed
	by a multi-line response. [Rich $alz <rsalz@uunet.uu.net>
	23 dec 92]

	Fixed the handling of really long lines.  Extended the
	LIST ACTIVE and LIST NEWSGROUPS commands to accept an
	optional <wildspec>.  Added the XROVER command.

	Defining DBZ will take care of defining DBM. [tgt@cblpf.att.com]
	Some minor changes to nntpxfer to remove the risk of doing an update
	when it's not necessary. [ccc141j@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au,
	corbin@utep-vaxa.uucp]
	Changes to nntpxmit to correctly utilize LOG_DEBUG when LOG is
	defined and not when it isn't. [alden@shape.mps.ohio-state.edu]

	compile. [rb@newton.physics.purdue.edu]
	Added more precision to time reports. [flee@shire.cs.psu.edu]
	Modified nntpsend.sh to use the correct test flag. 
	[zjat02@trc.amoco.com (Jon A. Tankersley)]
	Fixed a bug in check_ng that caused the server to close down
	and abort on occasion. [Jyrki Kuoppala <jkp@cs.hut.fi>]

	Support for mmap() system call in nntpxmit. [david@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov,
	stevo@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov]
	Changes for hpux so that SETPROCTITLE will work and flexnames can be
	used if supported. [pk@unidoct.chemietechnik.uni-dortmund.de,
	ken@hpdlz.sdd.hp.com]
	LOAD now supported when nntp is started by inetd. [mcooper@usc.edu]
1.5.9
	Incorporation of proposed NNTP version 2 authentication scheme.
	    This is a trial and can be disabled if necessary. [brian@ucsd.edu]
	Minor fixes to nntpxmit to use more configuration information from

	Fixed space checking code that has been tested more throughly!
	[eckert@informatik.uni-erlangen.de]
	Modifications to batch and spawn to correctly invoke inews when
	using Cnews. [gengenbach@forwiss.uni-passau.de]
	Bug fix to nextlast.c to return correct message when moving back

	Removed the presumption that USG means you don't have DBM from conf.h.
	[Mark Warren <mwarren@mips2.cr.bull.com>]

	See the new parameter MINFILES in common/README and common/conf.h.dist.
	[budd@bu.edu]
	USG systems with DBM can use it (assuming you compiled your news to use
	it) with less problems from nntp getting compiled wrong. 
	[igb@fulcrum.british-telecom.co.uk]
	IHAVE speed up by having gethistent() just do a check for an article
	instead of a full retrieval. [fletcher@cs.utexas.edu (Fletcher Maddox),
	david@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov (David Robinson)]
	If the article is garbled, it should be rejected. Hopefully, it will be
	now. [ warren@schizo.samsung.com (Warren Lavallee)]
	nntp now sets the USER and LOGNAME environmental variables to POSTER if
	POSTER is defined. This is mostly for CNEWS.[weening@neon.stanford.edu]

	<weening@neon.stanford.edu> ]
	Malformed history line messages were being logged when this was not
	the case. [fletcher@cs.utexas.edu (Fletcher Mattox)]
	Corrected MACH space call to correctly reflect that it only works
	with the CMU MACH and not NeXT. NeXT is also supported, but it
	uses a statfs call that is similiar to Sun. [Tom.Lane@zog.cs.cmu.edu]
	Added support for the REUSEADDR socket option to make it easier
	to deal with multiple copies of the daemon running. [rick@uunet.uu.net]
	Fixed a bug in nntp_awk so that the connection count from unknown
	explorers is correct. [Samuel Lam <skl@wimsey.bc.ca>]
	Fixed getword() subroutine in newnews.c so that it will work with 
	history files from B News 2.11 patch 17 and before and patch 18 and
	beyond and with CNEWS.[Rein Tollevik <rein@ifi.uio.no>]
	Corrected a bug in seekuntil() that caused the NEWNEWS command to
	never work correctly. [Rein Tollevik <rein@ifi.uio.no>,Dan Oscarsson
	<Dan@dna.lth.se>]
	Getting the .signature file from DOTDIR (in fakeinews) was inconsistent
	with real "inews"'s. It is now conditional. Define DO_DOTDIR if you
	want to have it use this environmental variable. [ Mark Davies
	<mark@comp.vuw.ac.nz>
	Added support for the CNEWS active.times file. If you run CNEWS, you
	won't need mkgrdates to get NEWGROUP to work as it should.
	[Felix Lee <flee@shire.cs.psu.edu>]
	Minor changes to nntpxmit so that it will get some information from
	common/conf.h like everything else does. [Michael A. Cooper
	<mcooper%acamar.usc.edu@usc.edu>]
	Bug fix to clientlib.c to allow systems that don't know about the new
	hostent structure to work. [Edwin Kremer <edwin@praxis.cs.ruu.nl>]
	UMASK support added so that CNEWS will not create world writeable 
	batches.[ Mark Nagel <nagel@wintermute.ics.uci.edu>]
	Updated nntpxfer to use get_tcp_conn.c from nntpxmit. This make it
	work on System V. nntpxfer is still largely unsupported, but we'll
	keep working to get it into shape. [Stan Barber <sob@bcm.tmc.edu>]
	Fixed access.c so that comma seperated lists of newsgroups in the
	nntp access file will be interpreted correctly. [mta@tut.fi]
	New version of shlock.c for nntpxmit. [fair@apple.com]

 	Bug fix to subnet.c to work on Sun 4 which delints it somewhat
 	[karl@triceratops.cis.ohio-state.edu (Karl Kleinpaste)]
 	Changed parsit.c to deal with whatever size words someone wanted
 	to pass it (until malloc() fails) [sob@bcm.tmc.edu]
 	Fixed LOG/SYSLOG definitions so they both don't have to be 
 	defined to work correctly [Felix Lee <flee@shire.cs.psu.edu>]
 	Bug fix for systems that used void as the return value for
 	signal() [ Peter J Nilsson <pjn@ida.liu.se>]
 	Added a feature to clientlib.c to allow the use of an IP number
 	(versus a name) for the NNTPSERVER [trn@warper.jhuapl.edu (Tony Nardo)]
 	Inews.c was modified to use the RN DOTDIR to find .signature and
 	to make a better attempt to check header syntax before passing it

	Initial TMNN reader support added. [suggested by erict@snark.UUCP,
	written by sob@bcm.tmc.edu] (NOTE: Support for the TMNN history file
	format IS NOT in this release.)
	Extended the nntp_access file to include domain name suffix support.
 	[esj@banana.cis.ufl.edu (Eric S. Johnson)]
	Replaced the 4.2-like fakesyslog with 4.3-like fakesyslog.
 	[John Robert LoVerso <loverso@xenna.encore.com>]

1.5.3	September 18, 1988
	Under the USGHIST option, the history file was not being closed
	before the next article coming in (via XFER) was processed. After
	about 20 articles, "No more files" would come up on the console.
	NNTP would take articles from incoming connection even though there
	was no space to store them. [sob@bcm.tmc.edu]

1.5.2	May 6, 1988
	Arguements were reversed in ahbs.c.
	Stoopid typo in strcasecmp.c for System V. [sob@bcm.tmc.edu]

1.5	February 26, 1988

	New top level Makefile.  [Casey Leedom, casey@lll-crg.llnl.gov]

	Now using strcasecmp/strncasecmp instead of streql/strneql.

	EXCELAN TCP support.  [Stan Barber, sob%soma.tmc.edu@tmc.edu]

	server/subnet.c now supports compiled-in netmasks.
	This is useful if you want subnet support on machines
	that don't have the necessary ioctls for determining
	network masks on a per-interface basis.

	Fake syslog support included for real this time.

1.4	October 15, 1987

	extraction stuff, Stan.  [Stan Barber, sob%%soma.uucp@rice.edu]

	Added transfer timeouts.  [Steve Schoch, schoch@ames.arpa]

	Compiled-in server name no longer supported.

	common/clientlib.c/getserverbyfile() now looks at the
	environment variable NNTPSERVER before checking the file.

	inews/inews.c now limits .signature files to MAX_SIGNATURE lines.

	server/misc.c/spawn() now returns the error output of rnews/inews
	alone with the posting failed code.  This is in turn printed by
	inews/inews.c so the user has some idea of why his article wasn't
	accepted.

	rn patches now for patchlevel #40

		Makefile fixes [harvard!lownlab!kiely]

	PYRAMID #defines removed, as it is all being done by default now.

	inews/inews.c now exits 0, since before it had a random exit
	status, causing pyramids to choke.  [forys@boulder.colorado.edu]

	server/server.c now logs user/system/elapsed time as floats
	instead of ints.  [rick@seismo.css.gov]

	server/ihave.c no longer logs every message id transfered but
	instead keeps statistics which are logged at the end.
	[rick@seismo.css.gov]

	server/access.c converts remote hostname to lower case
	when logging, in case you have a nameserver which is helping you.

	server/misc.c/getartbyid now reports message-id's when
	it encounters a malformed line in the history file.
	[gds@spam.istc.sri.com]

	inews/inews.c had an uninitialized variable, which
	could cause trouble.  [jwp%chem@sdcsvax.ucsd.edu]

	common/clientlib.c now understands 4.3 nameserver
	multiple addresses, and tries them all before
	giving up.

	common/clientlib.c has has 2 new functions:
	"getserverbyfile" opens a given file and returns
	the name of the server given in the file to use
	for news.  "handle_server_response" prints informative
	messages based on the initial connection response code.

	server/access.c now is case insensitive when checking
	for host read/xfer permissions.

	server/misc.c/spawn didn't check for a closed connection
	while receiving input from client.  As a result, truncated
	news articles could be received.

	server/newnews.c had a printf which was missing an
	argument.  [louie@trantor.umd.edu]

	Added fake syslog facility to server.  Code is in

1.3	30 June 1986

	rrn is no longer included as complete source, but
	rather as a set of context diffs and a program to
	apply them to your rn source.  Many thanks go to
	Gene Spafford for an outstanding job doing this.
	[spaf@gatech.csnet]

	The dreaded kill/save bug is fixed; rn was passing
	/bin/sh too many open file descriptors.  Thanks and a tip of the
	proverbial hat to Chris Maio!  Change to rrn/util.c.
	[chris@columbia.edu]	

	Fixed a bug in rrn/artio.c which caused an assertion
	failure on line 114 of artio.c; artopen was returning
	Nullfp without closing the fp associated with the
	bogus article.  [genrad!ens@eddie.mit.edu, beorn@ic.berkeley.edu]

	Added #define PYRAMID in common/conf.h, added some
	#ifdef PYRAMID code in server/misc.c to deal with
	Pyramids not initializing static data to 0, as well
	as an fseek problem.  [spaf@gatech.CSNET]

	Another wait bug fixed in spawn() in server/misc.c.

	Added a required \r in post.c.

	Added signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN) to server/serve.c,
	to fix exit status problem with ALONE defined.

	Statistics logging now returns sum of the nntpd and
	its children for process time.  server/main.c
	[fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]

	Subnet support for access file finally added.
	server/subnet.c added, common/conf.h now has
	#defines for SUBNET, DAMAGED_NETMASK.

	inews/inews.c now generates a from line with the UUCP
	name instead of always using gethostname().  common/conf.h
	changed to add #defines for UUNAME, GHNAME.
	[jwang@atrp.mit.edu]

	Added LIBS to Makefile. [soma!sob@rice.edu]

1.2c	17 May 1986

	Support for Masscomp added (#define MASSCOMP in ../common/conf.h).
	[soma!sob@rice.edu]

	Syslog output now requires SYSLOG to be defined in ../common/conf.h.
	This is handy on systems which, for some reason or another,
	don't have syslog.  [soma!sob@rice.edu]

	server/post.c had arguments reversed in a printf.  [salex@rice.edu]

	rrn/common.h had PIPESAVER misdefined. [cspencer@bbncc5.arpa]

	server/group.c was missing a \r in a printf.  [lear@rutgers.edu]

	xmit/nntpxmit.c is a new version.  Highlights include
	improved error reactions and logging info.  [fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]

	xmit/nntpsend is a shell script for sending news via nntp
	in a sane manner, with locking.  [pleasant@topaz.rutgers.edu,
	fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]  The locking mechanism is provided
	courtesy of Mr. Fair's "shlock.c", in xmit/shlock.c.

	support/nntp_awk produces weekly reports from the nntp server
	logging output.  [fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]

	Makefile (in this directory) would do a "make install" as
	the default action; it now prints a helpful message.
	[arnold@cgl.ucsf.edu]

	server/Makefile and support/Makefile had needless dependencies
	in them; if you didn't do a make depend, you'd have problems
	on a 4.2 system.  The server and support stuff now depend only
	on their own .h files.  [arnold@cgl.ucsf.edu]

1.2b	13 April 1986

	common/clientlib.c stupidly had some debugging printfs
	enabled.

	rrn/{artio.c,head.c} had sprintf("... %d", foo) where "foo"
	was a long.  %d -> %ld.  [cspencer@bbncc5.arpa]

	server/time.c had an order of evaluation problem in the
	macro "twodigtoi".  [fletcher@tzec.cs.utexas.edu, among others.]

	server/common.h included <dbm.h> if DBM was defined,
	caused multiply-defined NULL's.  [cda@opal.berkeley.edu,
	pleasant@topaz.rutgers.edu, among others.]

	server/active.c would lose because variable "i" would be
	at the end of the group array if it was called on a timer
	interrupt.  "i" now set to zero properly.  This only occurs
	if FASTFORK is defined.  [cda@opal.berkeley.edu]

1.2a	20 March 1986

	common/conf.h defined MAX_GROUPS as 300; this was too low on
	some machines.  Upped to 450.  [solex@rice.edu, beorn@ic.berkeley.edu]

	rrn/Makefile.sh had .c instead of .o for OBJS and SRCS
	respectively.  Also had cc -o ../common/clientlib.o (see below).

	inews/inews.c had (char *) 0 for gets(), which made SUN's upset.
	Changed to simply NULL. [brian@sdcsvax.ucsd.edu]
