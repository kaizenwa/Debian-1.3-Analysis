GNU Spell is a clone of standard Unix `spell', implemented as a
wrapper to Ispell.  Therefore you must install Ispell before Spell
will work.  To learn how to install Spell, see the file `INSTALL'.

I have tested Spell on Solaris 2.3, Sunos 4.1.3, Newsos 4.1C, and
Linux 1.3.52.  If it works for you on a different system, a brief note
saying which would be appreciated.  Any suggestions and comments are
also welcome, which can be sent to `tmorgan@pobox.com'.

Please send bug reports to `bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  See the
section "Problems" in the Spell manual for more information.

Spell is free software.  See the file `COPYING' for copying
conditions.
