       _m_o_s_t is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a
       time,  the  contents  of  a file on a terminal.  It pauses
       after each windowful and prints on the window status  line
       the  screen  the  file  name, current line number, and the
       percentage of the file so far displayed.

       Unlike other paging programs, _m_o_s_t is capable of  display-
       ing  an arbitrary number of windows as long as each window
       occupies at least two screen lines.  Each window may  con-
       tain the same file or a different file.  In addition, each
       window has its own mode.  For example, one window may dis-
       play  a  file  with its lines wrapped while another may be
       truncating the lines.  Windows may be `locked' together in
       the  sense  that if one of the locked windows scrolls, all
       locked windows will  scroll.   _m_o_s_t  is  also  capable  of
       ignoring  lines  that are indented beyond a user specified
       value.  This is useful when viewing computer  programs  to
       pick out gross features of the code.  See the `::oo' command
       for a description of this feature.

       In addition to displaying ordinary text  files,  _m_o_s_t  can
       also  display binary files as well as files with arbitrary
       ascii characters.  When a file is read into a buffer, _m_o_s_t
       examines  the  first  32 bytes of the file to determine if
       the file is a binary file and then switches to the  appro-
       priate  mode.   However, this feature may be disabled with
       the --kk option.  See the description of the --bb, --kk, --vv, and
       --tt options for further details.

       Text  files  may  contain  combinations  of underscore and
       backspace characters causing a  printer  to  underline  or
       overstrike.   When  _m_o_s_t  recognizes  this, it inserts the
       appropriate  escape  sequences  to  achieve  the   desired
       effect.   In  addition,  some  files  cause the printer to
       overstrike some characters by  embedding  carriage  return
       characters  in  the  middle  of a line.  When this occurs,
       _m_o_s_t  displays  the  overstruck  character  with  a   bold
       attribute.   This  feature facilitates the reading of UNIX
       man pages or a document produced by _r_u_n_o_f_f.   In  particu-
       lar,  viewing  this  document  with _m_o_s_t should illustrate
       this behavior provided that the underline characters  have
       not  been  stripped.   This  may be turned off with the --vv
       option.

       By default, lines with more characters than  the  terminal
       width  are  not  wrapped  but are instead truncated.  When

       truncation occurs, this is indicated by a `$' in  the  far
       right  column  of the terminal screen.  The RIGHT and LEFT
       arrow keys may be used to view lines which extend past the
       margins of the screen.  The --ww option may be used to over-
       ride this feature.  When a window is wrapped, the  charac-
       ter `\' will appear at the right edge of the window.

       Commands are listed below.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --11     VT100  mode.   This  is meaningful only on VMS sys-
              tems.  This option should be used if  the  terminal
              is  strictly a VT100.  This implies that the termi-
              nal does not have the ability to delete and  insert
              multiple  lines.   VT102s and above have this abil-
              ity.

       --bb     Binary mode.  Use this switch when you want to view
              files  containing 8 bit characters.  _m_o_s_t will dis-
              play the file 16  bytes  per  line  in  hexidecimal
              notation.  A typical line looks like:

                   01000000 40001575 9C23A020 4000168D     ....@..u.#. @...

              When  used  with the --vv option, the same line looks
              like:

                   ^A^@^@^@  @^@^U u 9C #A0    @^@^V8D     ....@..u.#. @...

       --kk     `Kanji' option.   Ordinarily,  _m_o_s_t  will  go  into
              binary mode if the file consists of non-ascii char-
              acters.  Sometimes this feature  is  not  desirable
              since  some terminals have a special interpretation
              for eight bit characters.  The --kk option turns  off
              the automatic sensing.

       --ss     Squeeze.   Replace multiple blank lines with a sin-
              gle blank line.

       --zz     option turns off gunzip-on-the-fly.

       --vv     Display control characters as in `^A'  for  control
              A.   Normally _m_o_s_t does not interpret control char-
              acters.

       --tt     Display tabs as `^I'.  This  option  is  meaningful
              only  when  used with the --vv option.  ++_l_i_n_e_n_o Start
              up at _l_i_n_e_n_o.

              not.

              option to delete a file  while  viewing  it.   This

              rather _m_o_s_t uses callable EDT and TPU  routines  to
              perform  the  editing  task.  In addition, _m_o_s_t can
              attach to a kept editor.  See the above  discussion
              of the environment variable MMOOSSTT__EEDDIITTOORR.

              This is system dependent.  On VMS, this causes _m_o_s_t
              to spawn a subprocess.  When  the  user  exits  the
              process,  _m_o_s_t  is  resumed.  On UNIX systems, _m_o_s_t
              simply suspends itself.

       ::nn     Skip to the next  filename  given  in  the  command
              line.   Use  the  arrow  keys  to scroll forward or
              backward through the file list.  `QQ' quits _m_o_s_t and
              any other key selects the given file.

       ::cc     Toggle case sensitive search.

       ::DD     Delete current file.  This command is only meaning-
              ful with the ++dd switch.

       ::oo, ::OO Toggle various options.  With  this  key  sequence,
              _m_o_s_t  displays  a prompt asking the user to hit one
              of: bbddttvvww.  The `bb', `tt', `vv', and `ww' options have
              the same meaning as the command line switches.  For
              example, the `ww' option will toggle wrapping on and
              off for the current window.

              The  `dd'  option must be used with a prefix integer
              _i.  All lines indented beyond _i columns will not be
              displayed.  For example, consider the fragment:

                   int main(int argc, char **argv)
                   {
                        int i;

                        for (i = 0; i < argc, i++)
                        {
                             fprintf(stdout,"%i: %s\n",i,argv[i]);
                        }
                        return 0;
                   }

              The  key sequence `11::oodd' will cause _m_o_s_t to display
              the file ignoring all  lines  indented  beyond  the
              first column.  So for the example above, _m_o_s_t would
              display:

                   int main(int argc, char **argv)...
                   }

              where the `...' indicates lines follow are not dis-
              played.

       This is useful when search for the occurrence of a  string

       _m_o_s_t uses the following environment variables:

       MMOOSSTT__SSWWIITTCCHHEESS
              This variable sets  commonly  used  switches.   For
              example, some people prefer to use _m_o_s_t with the --ss
              option so that excess  blank  lines  are  not  dis-
              played.   On  VMS this is normally done done in the
              login.com through the line:

                   $ define MOST_SWITCHES "-s"

       MMOOSSTT__EEDDIITTOORR (VMS only)
              Set this logical to one of three values: EDT,  TPU,
              or EMACS.  The default is EDT.  _m_o_s_t does not spawn
              an editor.  Rather, it uses callable EDT and TPU to
              perform  the editing task.  Since VMS does not sup-
              port callable EMACS, _m_o_s_t will attempt to attach to
              a  kept  EMACS.   For this case, _m_o_s_t looks for the
              logical name EMACS_PID and attaches to the  process
              with  that  pid.   It  then  defines  the  logicals
              EMACS_FILE_NAME and EMACS_FILE_LINE which EMACS can
              check upon attaching to it.

       MMOOSSTT__HHEELLPP

              provide online help.  However, this behavior may be
              changed at compile time.  See the Makefile for more

       Almost  all  of  the known bugs or limitations of _m_o_s_t are
       due to a desire to read and interpret  control  characters
       in files.  One problem concerns the use of backspace char-
       acters to underscore or overstrike other characters.  _m_o_s_t
       makes an attempt to use terminal escape sequences to simu-
       late this behavior.  One side effect is the one  does  not
       always  get what one expects when scrolling right and left
       through a file.  When in doubt, use the --vv and --bb  options
       of _m_o_s_t.

       String may not work properly with binary files.

       I  would like to thank the users of _m_o_s_t for valuable com-
       ments and criticisms.  I would especially  like  to  thank
       those individuals who have contributed code to _m_o_s_t:

       Mats Akerberg, Henk D. Davids, Rex O. Livingston, and Mark
       Pizzolato.

       I am grateful to Robert Mills <robert@jna.com.au> for  re-
       writing the search routines to use regular expressions.

       Sven  Oliver  Moll <smol0075@rz.uni-hildesheim.de> came up
       with the idea of automatic detection of zipped files.

       I would also like to thank Shinichi Hama for his  valuable
       criticisms of _m_o_s_t_.

       Thanks  to David W. Sanderson (dws@cs.wisc.edu) for adapt-
       ing the documentation to nroff man page source format.
