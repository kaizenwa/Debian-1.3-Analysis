MAGICFILTER is a customizable, extensible automatic printer filter.
Although written for Linux, it should work on any UNIX system which
has an ANSI C compiler.

If you use MAGICFILTER and find it useful, I would appreciate an email
note from you.  If you are using it on a type of printer that I do not
have, I would also appreciate a copy of your configuration file for
inclusion in future versions.  If you have suggestions for
improvement, I would love to hear them as well.
