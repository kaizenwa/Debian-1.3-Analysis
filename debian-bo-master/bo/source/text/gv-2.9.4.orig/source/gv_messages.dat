! GV Messages
! Syntax:
!   Every message is of the form
!      #begin <keyword>
!         <message>
!      #end   <keyword>
!   where <keyword> identifies the message.
!   Note that the enclosing '#begin' and '#end' lines
!   must start with the '#' character at the very left (no indentation).
!   The first column of <message> is not displayed, characters
!   in the first column serve as identifier and cause exactly one
!   occurence of '%s' to be replaced by some string as listed below.
!      Identifiers    Replacement                   Example Replacement
!      C              application class             GV
!      N              name of this instance of      GV or gv or mygv
!                     the application
!      A              replaces exactly one %s by    gv
!                     the application name
!      V              application name + version    gv
!   

!----------------
! If the command line can not be parsed correctly
! the foolowing message is shown.

#begin cmdline-error
V  %s  Error: unknown options in command line.
#end   cmdline-error

!----------------
! The following text is shown if the -h or -? options are used.
! or if an error during command line parsing is encountered.
! Just display a short screen showing the syntax of the
! options. Anything else might annoy the user.
! However, you are certainly free to include here whatever
! you want ....

! get listed here too.

!----------------
! The following text is displayed if the 'version' resource is not
! loaded into the applications database, thereby indicating that
! the class resource file was not found or could not be accessed
! for other reasons.
! You may want to choose a more elaborate description ...

#begin missing-resources
V  %s  Error: no resources found.
 
   The application class-specific resource file can not be accessed.
 
#end   missing-resources

!----------------
! GV checks the value of the 'version' resource
! in the resource database against the version number of the
! executable to detect incompatibilities.
! If a clash is detected, the following message is shown.
! Again, you might want to replace this by some more explicit
! advice ...

#begin version-mismatch
V  %s  Error: incompatible resources detected.
 
   The application class-specific resource file does not match 
A  this version of %s.
   Please update the resource file before restart.
#end   version-mismatch
