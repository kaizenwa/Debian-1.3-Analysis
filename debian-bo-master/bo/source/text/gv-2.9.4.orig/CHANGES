%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 2.9.4  (20 March 1997) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# Add another mouse binding in the main window.
  A double click with the left mouse button in the left/right half
  of the shown page causes the previous/next page to be displayed.

# Add yet another mouse binding in the main window.
  A click with the right mouse button pops up a small menu offering
  a few standard action.

# Allow gv to either respect or ignore document structuring comments
  when opening a file. This should be helpful when viewing documents
  with faulty structuring comments.
  To toggle between these two states a new menu entry has been added to 
  the 'File' menu.
  A keyboard binding to toggle DSC parsing on and off has beem added as
  well. By default the key is 'I'.
  Alternatively the new command line options '-dsc' and '-nodsc' may be
  used.

# Keep the point located in the center of the visible area of the 
  displayed page centered when changing the magnification or
  orientation.

# Add resources 'minimumWidth' and 'minimumHeight' to allow users
  to specify a size beyond which gv will never shrink so that all
  controls and titles remain accessible when changing the magnification
  or the page media or ...
  For both resources the default value is 400.

# Merge in a few patches enlarging and correcting the set of allowed
  papersizes.
  [ thanks to Andreas Schott (schott@rzg.mpg.de) ]
 
# Add Keyboard binding to toggle antialiasing on and off.
  By default the key 'A' is used.

# Add Keyboard binding to toggle the resize behaviour of the main window
  between 'Fixed Size' and 'Variable Size'.
  By default the key 'Z' is used.

# Update the documentation. The new sections mainly cover resources
  and key and mouse bindings.

# Fix a bug that causes gv to crash when the current page media
  is 'Bounding Box' and the user disables automatic page media
  selection.

# Fix a bug that causes wrong page media selection when changing
  from a document with document specific papersizes to one without
  document specific papersizes (or vice versa).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 2.7.6  (1 November 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# 'Upgrade' postscript scanner to be able to read buggy Windows NT
  generated postscript files.
  Mark Pfeifer (pfeiferm%ppddev@comet.cmis.abbott.com) found that 
  Windows NT generates files which show some non-comment postscript
  code after the '%%EndSetup' and before the first page comment
  '%%Page: x y'.
# VMS: Built in Rick Dyson's (dyson@blanc.physics.uiowa.edu) two small
  changes for the Xmu library to allow compilation with DECC 5.2.
  Note that these changes do not affect the sources of gv itself,
  it's only the VMS specific archive xmu_4.zip which was modified.
# Use my own scrollbar widget to avoid problems people encounter with
  hacked Xaw3d libraries.
# Make 'make depend' cleaner.
  [thanks to Thomas Gellekum (thomas@ghpc8.ihf.rwth-aachen.de)]
# Include Xfuncs.h in ps.c and Ghostview.c to avoid unresolved memmove()
  on SunOS
  [thanks to Harald Boehme (boehme@informatik.hu-berlin.de)]
# VMS: Fix a problem which reapperared in 2.7 b5 and caused certain file
  formats (non LF_STREAM,CR_STREAM) not to be read correctly.
  [thanks to Tim Adye (adye@v2.rl.ac.uk)]
# Correct wrong URL in the documentation.
  [thanks to Helmut Geyer (hardy@lynx.ps.uci.edu)]
# Change some resource bindings s that gv works on SunOS.
  [thanks to Matthias Klose (doko@cs.tu-berlin.de)]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 2.7 b5  ( 1 August 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# Add doc/gv.man, doc/gv.ps, doc/gv.html to provide at least some
  documentation about gv's command line options.
# Unix: Fixed the 'Update File' button (everything related to updating
  the displayed file when the modification date changed didn't work
  correctly). 
  [thanks to Lars Bruecher (bruecher@dipmza.physik.uni-mainz.de) for
  telling me about the bug]
# Fixed 'Reopen'. After reopening a (changed) file gv displayed the first
  page instead of the current page.
  [thanks to Lars Bruecher (bruecher@dipmza.physik.uni-mainz.de) for
  telling me about the bug]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 2.7 b4  (31 July 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# Fixed extracting pages
  [thanks to Arne Mueller (amuelle3@gwdg.de) for telling me about the bug]
# Allow for a possible extra byte in front of the "%!PS-Adobe-" identifier
  at the beginning of the file for comaptibility reasons.
  [thanks to Ronan Melennec (MELENNEC_Ronan@cena.dgac.fr) for suggesting
  this change]
# Fixed errorneous detection of the "-arguments <arguments>" command-line
  option. 
  [thanks to Dr. Gunnar Ribitzki (ribitzki@clri6f.gsi.de) for his patch]
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 2.7 b3  (15 June 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# Fixed code for appending <lf>s at the end of ps-sections of <cr>
  oriented files on Unix systems (thanks to Tim Adye (adye@v2.rl.ac.uk)).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 2.7 b2  (8 June 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# VMS: use explicit ftell() calls in ps.c to get reliable file positions
       whenever possible (thanks to Tim Adye (adye@v2.rl.ac.uk)).
* Use read() instead of fread() in ps.c to unify VMS and Unix code.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 2.7 b1  (2 June 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This version

  # offers an improved PDF capability:
    a) Page numbers are shown, allowing to freely move through the
       document.
    b) Saving marked pages of a PDF file (or the whole file) is now a
       valid operation. The file will first be converted to postscript,
       then the pages are extracted and saved to the destination file.
       Since the PDF->PS conversion takes a considerable amount of time
       it is done "in the background" to not block the user interface.
    c) Printing marked pages of a PDF file (or the whole file) is now 
       also a valid option. The marked pages are first saved in
       postscript format, then they are printed. Printing is also done
       "in the background" due to the involved PDF->PS conversion.

  # provides an additional layout of the main window for those who want
    to minimize the on-screen-area consumption of gv. To use it start
    gv by executing
      $ gv -style gv_spartan.dat
    The file gv_spartan.dat contains a layout description which omits
    some of the buttons shown in the standard version and which uses
    a different on-screen arrangement of the remaining widgets.

  # provides an option to reverse the scrolling behaviour in the main
    window.

  # widens the class of previewable postscript documents by
    a) removing the constraint that lines shouldn't have more than 
       255 characters.
    b) allowing LF, CR and CR LF as line terminators.

  # removes the concept of a "forced" orientation and media. Instead the
    orientation and papersize menus offer the "Automatic" entry, which,
    if selected, advices gv to use the orientation and media extracted
    from the DSC comments.

  # uses a different algorithm for smoothing the scrolling process in the
    main window. The new method is based on taking an average of the last
    few motion events.

  # handles some resources more restrictive for security reasons.
    Those resources are prefixed by "GVintern" and may only be set
    via a command line option or in the resource file "~/.gv" 
    (or "DECW$USER_DEFAULTS:GV.DAT" on VMS).
    Affected are, for instance, "GVintern.printCommand" and 
    "GVintern.gsArguments". After installation the file "gv_intern_res.dat"
    contains a complete list of these resources.

  # uses by default a Pixmap instead of requesting Backing Store from
    the X Server (GV*useBackingPixmap: True).

  # uses an improved version of the FileSelection Widget.

  # fixes a bug in the file selection widget which causes a crash
    on OpenVMS VAX.

  # doesn't show tons of String-to-Pixmap conversion warnings on
    Motif displays anymore.

  # corrects a bug in the layout of the main window which caused a wrong
    horizontal scaling behaviour.

  # fixes a bug which caused the comment '%%Pages: 0" to appear in saved
    postscript files.

  # fixes problematic file inclusion macros in "paths.h" which caused
    errors for a lot of people.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GhostView-VMS 2.3   (1 March 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) New platform (linux)
2) New widgets: Clip,Frame,Aaa
3) New Layout
4) New method to define regions to be magnified by zoom popups.
5) New Zoom Popups (scrollable)
6) New Bugfixes
7) New Bugs

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GhostView-VMS 2.1   (18 January 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) added "basic" PDF support. PDF files are handled in the same way
   as unstructured PS files now.

2) fixed a quite large memory leak which appeared in the VMS_DIR.C code.

3) added the -landscape,-portrait, -seascape and -upsidedown options
   which somehow got lost in previous versions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GhostView-VMS 2.0.3 (1 February 1995) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) callback 'cb_moveSlider' in file CALLBACKS.C calls 'XtCallActionProc'
   which is buggy in the VMS/X11R4 implemetation and causes a crash
   at startup -> fixed
   Related problem appears in ACTIONS.C when in action_panner
   XtRemoveCallback(pageview,XtNreportCallback,...) is called.
   Also a problem only on R4 ... -> fixed
   (thanks to Martin Zinser who provided an account on an X11R4 machine,
   so that the tests could be made).

2) color specifications of type 'rgb:x/y/z' do not work on VMS/X11R4.
   They got replaced in the resource files by specifications of 
   type 'grayX'.

3) some ps-formatters include the 'end' command in the last page,
   not in the trailer. These may cause ghostscript to break if
   switching from the last page to another page.
   Therefore the compile time option 'GV_RESTART_IF_BUSY' has been
   introduced (see CONFIG.H).
   Enabling this option may help but will slow down performance for
   many correctly formatted files also.
   By default this options is not activated.
