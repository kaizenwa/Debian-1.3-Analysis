* TODO file for GNU recode				-*- outline -*-

Tell <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca> if you feel like volunteering for any
of these ideas, listed more or less in decreasing order of priority.
Some TODO items are implicit from received email.  See file BACKLOG.

.* Mechanics
. + Intercept signals to cleanup the temporary files in any event.
. + Revise --sequence=pipe thoroughly.
. + Rewrite execute_pipe_sequence for having only one child per parent.
. + Revise --force thoroughly.
. + Rewrite .l converses for lat1{asci,ltex,txte}, for --force.
. + Optimize/merge all one-to-many cases.
. + Write a better `make check', not as partial and forgiving.
. + Modify recode so I can get rid of diacrit.[ch] (elsewhere).
. + Have -l know which output charset to use (Martin Maechler, 93-12-07).
. + Take note that ->RFC1345 recodings are non reversible.

.* Charsets
. + Integrate -c and -g into charsets.
. + `recode -g ibmpc:ibmpc' is not that trivial, find something.
. + Clean up applemac vs macintosh and ibmpc vs ibm437.
. + Implement RFC1345 more fully.
. + Generalize older charsets (latex, texte, etc.) to RFC 1345 mnemonics.
. + Support VT320 support and related character sets.  (Alain Simon)
. + Support @code{[nt]roff} diacritics.
. + Support Universite de Montreal ``accent'' convention.
