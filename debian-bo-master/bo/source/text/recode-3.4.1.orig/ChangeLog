	well as new ones.  Accept &#NNN; where NNN is a Latin-1 code.
	Accept &brkbar; for &brvbar;, and &Dstrok; for &ETH;, accounting
	for HTF conventions.  So, html:l1 | l1:html could be used for

	* ltexlat1.l: Recode `~' (instead of `\ ') to 160.
	Reported by Nicolas Anquetil.

	* ltexlat1.l: Ensure that recode does not match only part of the
	identifier following `\'.  This was easily solved by adding a few
	Flex rules at end and relying on the Flex longest match law.
	For example, because Latin-1 misses the latin `oe' diphtong (!),
	`\oe' was seen as the recodable `\o' followed by an isolated `e'.
	Reported by Mac Pigman and Nicolas Anquetil.

	* ltexlat1.l: Reformatted for a more uniform Flex quoting.

	* recode.c (execute_popen_sequence): Ensure -d option is properly

	put in distdos the preparation of libobjs.lst and objects.lst.

Fri Feb  4 10:26:22 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	and return 0 if any step fails, if this happens, unlink a possibly
	existing temporary file.

	* recode.c (execute_pipe_sequence): Unconditionnaly close the
	output file from the parent before waiting, instead of closing
	it only if there was an output name.  Let the parent accumulate

	since flex (version 2.4.6) generated scanners are self contained.
	* flexlib.c: Deleted.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

	* recode.c (optimizable_type): New, from optimize_sequence.
	(optimize_sequence): Use it.

	Also, check for preventing the production of a few sequences which
	would might be recoded back differently, unless -f.
	* mergelex.awk: Similarily for generated file_<step_name>
	routines.  Return the yylex result.  At <<EOF>>, return 1.

	* charset.c (make_argmatch_array): Print a line of hash statistics
	if HASH_STATS is defined.

	I used to have 408 names in 343/997 buckets, the following patch

Tue Dec 21 15:25:36 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* *.c: Delete unused variables, add a few missing const's.

	* nextstep.c: Rewritten for using a double step, instead of two
	steps in and out latin1; the new code is triggered by defining
	USE_DOUBLE_STEP, the old code will be kept for a little while.
	This has two advantages: recode can obey various -l options for
	NeXTSTEP, and I can remove the full style table from the
	documentation.
	Reported by Martin Maechler.

	* Makefile.in (clean): Also delete unhexify.

	* Makefile.in (tags): Include $(HEADERS).

	@item's by charset name and, within each, sort aliases.

	* recode.h: Add a size field to the charset structure, declare a
	size parameter to declare_double_step.
	* charset.pl: Handle charsets having more than 2 characters per
	symbol, transmit measured size into declare_double_step calls.
	* recode.c (declare_double_step): Accept and save a size parameter.
	* charset.c (code_to_symbol): New routine for handling size field.
	(list_full_charset, list_concise_charset): Adapt to using it.

Thu Dec 16 07:03:00 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* charset.c: Add cleanup_charset_name, use it in find_charset,
	declare_alias and decode_charset_name.  Rename compare_hash_name
	to compare_struct_hash.
	(list_all_charsets): Repeat the name even if it is not alias,
	because it has been cleaned up.
	Reported by Keld J|rn Simonsen.

Tue Dec 14 11:45:53 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* charset.pl: Generating charset.h instead of charset.c.
	* charset.c: New.
	* recode.c (prepare_charset_initialization): New.
	(hash_string, find_charset, declare_alias, make_argmatch_array,
	decode_charset_name, compare_hash_name, list_all_charsets,
	list_full_charset, list_concise_charset): Moved into charset.c,
	together with a few defines, struct hash and related declarations.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

Mon Dec 13 12:55:24 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* Renaming rfc1345.c into charset.c, rfc1345.pl into charset.pl,
	rfc1345.sed into charset.sed and rfc1345.LOG into charset.LOG.
	* Makefile.in, charset.pl: Adjusted.

	* charname.c: New.
	* charname.pl, charname.sed: New, for generating charname.h.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.
	* recode.h: Add declaration for charname_to_comment.
	* recode.c: list_charsets renamed to list_all_charsets.
	New functions list_full_charset and list_concise_charset, enum and
	variable list_format.  Decode the list format, check for a charset
	argument and switch to the proper listing function.

	* acconfig.h: New, for holding DEFAULT_CHARSET.
	* Makefile.in: Distribute it, have .stamp-h.in depend on it.
	* configure.in: Substitute DEFAULT_CHARSET instead of DEFCHARSET.

	* configure.in: Include $LEXLIB in $LIBS when $LEX is flex, so the
	yy_flex_alloc test will not always fail, waiting for a version of
	Autoconf which will do this itself.
	* Makefile.in: Do not add @LEXLIB@ to LIBS anymore.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* checkit: Replace `+' by `*' in grep calls.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* recode.c (usage): Replace --include by --header in text.

Sat Dec 11 08:39:58 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* recode.c (list_charsets): Move all aliases of a charset after
	the true charset name on its line, keeping lines sorted on the
	true charset name and all alias in lexicographical order.  All
	charset and aliases used to be sorted together, one per line. 
	(compare_hash_names): Sort accordingly.
	Reported by Martin Maechler.

	* recode.c: Add make_argmatch_array and decode_charset_name.  Use
	them, simplifying decode_before_after.  Process ignored_charset
	even for the -a option.  Add print_truncated_charset_name and use
	it to simplify report_about_all_sequences, not reporting an
	unachievable recoding when ignored_charset is specified.

	* recode.c (find_sequence): Ensure verbose is executed even if no
	path has been found, instead of returning early.

	* recode.c (optimize_sequence): Remove the compute_arrays
	parameter, because report_about_all_sequences now studies the
	produced arrays.  Callers changed.

	* recode.c (optimize_sequence): While merging rfc1345 steps, also
	merge qualities instead of assuming REVERSIBLE.
	Reported by Rejean Payette.

	* recode.h: Declare strict_mapping.
	* recode.c (complete_pairs): Do not set quality, this is done
	elsewhere in all cases.  But do preset the file recoding routine.
	* applemac.c, atarist.c, nextstep.c: In declare_step calls, lower
	the recoding quality to some *_TO_MANY whenever strict mapping is
	in use, also specify NULL as the file recoding routine because
	complete_pairs now initializes it.
	* ibmpc.c: Idem.  But override file_recode after complete_pairs.

	* ibmpc.c (file_latin1_ibmpc, file_ibmpc_latin1): Repeat the
	algorithm, but using the one_to_many table when strict mapping.

	* recode.c (declare_double_step): Create both single steps without
	the help of declare_step, this spares four probes in the charset
	table per call.

Fri Dec 10 00:02:19 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* recode.h: Add CHARSET and struct charset, use CHARSET *before
	and after instead of int start_charset and goal_charset in STEP,
	declare rfc1345 as CHARSET * instead of int, delete struct
	double_link and rfc1345_link declaration and rather include the
	DOUBLE_TABLE right in CHARSET, add a DOUBLE_TABLE parameter to
	declare_double_step,
	* recode.c: Make all necessary related changes.  Renaming of many
	variables and cleanup, too numerous to report here.  Delete
	name_from_value and ignored_array in favor of new CHARSET fields.

	* recode.c: Change :rfc1345 to rfc1345.  Add `.' as an alias.
	(report_about_all_sequences): Avoid rfc1345 instead of avoiding
	names beginning with colon.

	* applemac.c: Renamed (once again) from macintosh.c.  The codes
	will be kept different until further study.  Comment out the
	aliasing of applemac to macintosh.
	* ibmpc.c: Comment out the aliasing of ibmpc to ibm437, because
	making the codes equivalent requires further study.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

	* recode.c: Implement --ignore (-x) option and ignored_array.
	(find_charset): Progressively initialize ignored_array to zero.
	(find_sequence): Ignore steps with an ignored start charset.
	(decode_before_after): Process the ignored charset.

	* recode.c (usage): Make the output little more legilable through
	spacing.  Insist on -l, mention the Info documentation, propose a
	few selected charsets.
	Reported by Martin Maechler.

	* recode.c: Rename make_include_mode into make_header_mode,
	include_name into header_name, output_include_file into
	output_header_file, turn --include option name into --header.

	* recode.c: Add before_name and after_name, use them in
	decode_before_after and in output_header_file.  This prevents
	the spurious canonalization of alias charset names.

	* recode.c: Implement --strict (-s) option.
	(complete_pairs): Accept a step parameter and slip the generated
	table in it instead of returning the table.  Adjust for --strict.
	(init_recode_rfc1345): Adjust for complete_pairs.
	* atarist.c, macintosh.c, nextstep.c: Idem.
	* ibmpc.c: Idem.  Also rewrite code for --graphics (-g).

	* ascilat1.l, txtelat1.l: Delete the diaeresis_char declaration.
	* mergelex.awk: Have it work when there is no %{ ... %}	part.

	* recode.c (report_about_all_sequences): Report charsets which are
	dynamically discoverd to recode identically by "ONE to SAME".

	* recode.c: Declare HASH_TABLE_SIZE, hash_string.  Rewrite
	find_charset and declare_alias to use hashing.  Also adjust
	list_charsets and decode_before_after.

Thu Dec  9 18:39:41 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* recode.c: Delete name_from_value function, replace with an
	array of same name.  Delete field refer from struct charset,
	initialize and use name_from_value instead.

	* Makefile.in (clean): Remove *.a, for librec.a.
	Reported by Pierre Gaumond.

	* Makefile.in (clean): Move in *.o from mostlyclean.

	* rfc1345.pl: Print progress on stderr, for entertaining me.
	Document aliases in rfc1345.texi through English sentences.

	* recode.c (name_from_value): Renamed from true_charset_name.
	(find_charset): Add a "create" parameter, merge in new_charset.

	Reported by Pierre Gaumond.

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Remove config.h.

	* bangbang.c, cdcnos.c: Use "while (x = y, x != z)" instead of
	"while ((x = y) != z)".

	* install.sh: Attach execute permission to this file.
	Reported by Pierre Girard.

	* lat1ltex.c: Produce {\i} instead of \i{}.  It's nicer.
	Reported by Pierre Girard.

	* recode.c: Declare argmatch.  Default charsets were not obeyed.
	(decode_before_after): When DEFAULT_CHARSET is defined, use it
	instead of the empty string when calling argmatch.
	(find_charset): Do not check for empty strings anymore.

Tue Dec  7 08:54:14 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* Makefile.in (install): Add recode.info in dependencies.

	* recode.c: Use USE_TMPNAM to bracket out old tmpnam code out and
	USE_TMPFILE to allow in new tmpfile code.
	(execute_pass_sequence):  Use tmpfile instead of tmpnam.
	Reported by Bastian Schlueter (suggests that -i => -o on NeXT).
	Reported by Ronald C.F. Antony.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* recode.c (output_include_file): Ensure a valid C identifier for
	the table name.  RFC 1345 uses bizarre names in that respect.

	properly diagnose any failure.
	Reported by David Lebel.

	* recode.c: Add decoding_charset_flag.
	(usage): Print `Try recode --list' instead of `Try recode --help'

	* recode.c (echo_sequence): Use a shorter print format, now that
	we have real long charset names...

	* recode.c: Revert to using a `struct charset' to handle names and
	alias.  Turn charset_name into true_charset_name and charset_value
	into find_charset.

	* Makefile.in (LIBOBJS): Put more on the second line, because if
	@LIBOBJS@ is substituted empty, some make's barf at last `\'.
	(recode.dvi): TEXI2DVI was mispelled.
	Reported by Martin Maechler.

	* recode.c: Implement --list (-l) to alleviate Usage message.

	(optimize_sequence): Replace all double steps through :rfc1345 by
	a single step which will properly initialize itself.  Diagnose any
	remaining single step which uses :rfc1345 explicitely.
	(register_all_modules): Make latin1 an alias for iso-8859-1-1987.
	(report_about_all_sequences): Truncate the charset
	names as needed, avoid considering charsets named `:*' alone.
	(usage): Avoid printing `:*' steps as available.
	* ascilat1.l, cdcnos.c, ebcdic.c, flat.c, lat1asci.c: Change name
	of ascii charset to ascii-bs, keeping it separate from RFC 1345.
	* ibmpc.c: Make ibmpc an alias for ibm437.
	* Makefile.in (check): Adjusted for ascii-bs.

	As a side result of all this, more charsets are supported.
	Reported by Per ?: who wanted IBM codepages in recode.
	Reported by Hermann Hueni: who wanted Roman8 in recode.

	* Makefile: Merge C_STEPOBJS and L_STEPOBJS into STEPOBJS.

	* recode.c: Make -h argument optionnal, it was mandatory.
	* recode.c: Include the quality in -a and -v output, repeat -v
	output after step optimization if this changed something.

	* recode.h: Declare enum quality, QUALITY, quality_to_string and
	merge_qualities.  From STEP, delete the multichar_input,
	multichar_output, loosing and reversible fields.  Add one QUALITY
	argument and two functionnal arguments to declare_step.
	* all: Implement the preceeding changes.

	* recode.h: Use the _((...)) device more systematically.
	Declare xmalloc.

	"-I$(srcdir)" instead of "-o recode.info".

	* ebcdic.c: Inclusion of GNU dd's "ibm" recoding, with two
	modifications so the recoding becomes reversible.  Removal of
	static inverse tables, dynamically recreate them instead.
	Replacement of cccascii and cdcascii by ascii, use ebcdic-ccc
	instead of ebcdic in the context of disappearing cccascii.
	* recode.c (invert_table): New.
	* recode.h: Declare it.

	* recode.c, all $(C_STEPS), all $(L_STEPS): Include "recode.h"
	instead of "config.h".
	* recode.h: New.

	* all $(C_STEPS): Delete "#define STEP <name>", because STEP will
	be a describing structure from now on.  Add module_<name> function
	for initializing STEPs.  Rename void STEP() to static int
	recode_file(), add a first parameter for transmitting STEP.
	* all $(L_STEPS): Delete "#define STEP <name>" and instead, use
	"/* Step name: <name>.  */".
	* mergelax.awk: Do the proper thing with /* Step name: <name>.  */

	single step methods are now easily configurable out of recode by
	merely deleting them from C_STEPOBJS or L_STEPS in Makefile.
	Reported by Claude Goutier.

Wed Dec  1 10:13:37 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* ltexlat1.l: Ensure \'{e} is recognized as \'e.
	Reported by Pierre Girard.

	* txteasci.l: Deleted for easing maintainance, there was too much
	common code with txtelat1.l, and also, the "texte" charset is
	prone to loosing characters, when used as an intermediate.
	Reported by Claude Goutier.

	* ascitxte.l: Deleted likewise, almost same functionnality is
	available through lat1txte.c.
	* ltexasci.l: Deleted for easing maintainance, there was too much
	common code with ltexlat1.l.
	* asciltex.l: Deleted likewise, almost same functionnality is

	* lat1bang.c: Do the converse translatation.  "oe" is a kludge!
	Reported by Pierre Gaumond.

	* checkit: Always output "Checking" messages, regardless of -v.
	Have those messages resembling more to the actual recode calls.
	Remove now useless error identification messages.
	Use "cmp -s" instead of "diff" for comparing files.
	* Makefile.in: Use $(SHELL) instead of sh in CHECKTEST. Remove -v.

Mon Nov 29 10:23:39 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	Flex 2.4.1 does not get YY_CHAR defined for section 1.
	* txtelat1.l: Move texte_latin1_diaeresis in section 3.
	* mergelex.awk: Deeply revised.  Now able to merge Flex sources
	having a non-empty section 3.  No more forward declarations for
	yytext, yyleng, etc.  The output begins with a warning comment
	saying this is a derived file, followed by the first block comment
	found in any input file.  Produce an output cleaner for the eye.
	* Makefile.in (merged.c): Remove synchronization directives, they
	are useless for now.  Delete new temporary files merged[123].tmp.

Wed Jun  9 15:00:58 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* Makefile.in: In dist goal, ensure 777 mode for directories, so
	older tar's will restore file modes properly.

	* asciflat.c: Remove old commented lex code.  Remove a useless
	`case EOF:' from inner switch, the logic will work anyway.

Sun Jan 17 15:50:28 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	standards.  Moreover, add a recode.dvi goal and a texclean goal.

Thu Jul 16 18:49:48 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* configure.in: Changes for Autoconf 0.120.  Also test for popen,
	even if almost any UNIX has it; so the user can later undefine it from
	DEFS; avoid testing for pipe because of an old bug in this area.
	* Makefile.in, recode.c, checkit, common.h: Replace all *_MISSING
	by HAVE_*.

Thu Jun 18 07:44:58 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	Makefile.

Mon Jun  1 23:06:44 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Changes for Autoconf 0.112.  Avoid
	FP_PROG_MAKEINFO and use `makeinfo' directly.

Thu Nov  7 11:21:38 1991  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* recode.texi: Should now be TeXable.
	* Makefile.in: Insure distributing texinfo.tex.

	* ibmpicon.c, iconibmp.c: Use 0x1E for QNX end of lines, 0x0E was
	wrong.

	* configure.in: Take care of POSIXish ISC.

Tue Nov  5 09:47:15 1991  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Do not absolutize $(srcdir), because
	this could create problems with automounters.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Remove IF_* devices, they were
	solving a problem caused only by non timestamping shars, and
	recode is now distributed in tar or zoo format.

Mon Nov  4 18:14:49 1991  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* configure.in: Get rid of the head program, using sed.  I would
	also like, eventually, to get rid of file and grep programs too.

Fri Nov  1 12:30:59 1991  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* recode.c (main): Use rename library routine if available.
	* configure.in: Check for rename availability.

	* Makefile.in: Insure gawk is executed in the source directory
	while preparing merged.c.

	* recode.c (execute_pipe_sequence): Close descriptor after dup2.

	* Version 3.2.

	* all: Replace GPL version 1 by GPL version 2.

	* Makefile.in: Use `sh checkit' instead of `./checkit'.  For an
	unknown reason, the Sparc requires this.

	* recode.c: Define str[r]chr to be [r]index if not USG.

	* recode.c: Force binary mode on files for MSDOS.

Sun Oct 27 11:03:07 1991  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* recode.c: MSDOS port.  tempnam(), utime(), link() and getopt()
	were missing; replacements inspired from by Rahul Dhesi's flip.
	* configdos.pl, config.tcc: New.
	* getopt.c: New, AT&T freed code.
	* Makefile.in: Adjustements for MSDOS port, dist.dos goal.

	* checkit: New.
	* Makefile.in: Use checkit in check goal.

Wed Oct 23 13:14:33 1991  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* recode.c: Revert back to -v instead of -q.  Give the user some
	more control on the sequencing strategy through -i, -o and -p.
	Get rid of any USE_FILE, USE_POPEN and USE_PIPE.  However, keep
	POPEN_MISSING and PIPE_MISSING around, for MSDOS.  Segregating
	between `popen' and `pipe' is only experimental, while trying to
	have `pipe' working correctly.

	* configure, Makefile.in: New.  Many new configuration features.
	Among others, through IF_FLEX, be careful to never loose merged.c
	on those systems which do not have the machinery to remake it.
	* GNUmakefile, Makefile, Depends: deleted.

Sun Mar 31 17:50:04 1991  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	switch (var=exp) -> var=exp; switch (var).

	* recode.c (code_index): Use usage_and_exit ().  Moved.
	* recode.c (echo_sequence): Print format changed.
	* recode.c: Issue `recoding FILE ...done' messages, unless -q.

	* ibmplat1.c, lat1ibmp.c, ibmpmaci, maciibmp.c, txteibmp.c:
	While reading MS-DOS files, 0x0D followed by 0x0A is converted
	to an end of line; while writing MS-DOS files, end of lines
	are converted to 0x0D 0x0A.
	* ibmpicon.c, iconibmp.c: While reading QNX files, 0x0E is
	converted to 0x0D 0x0A; while writing QNX files, 0x0D followed
	by 0x0A is converted to 0x0E.

	* txteibmp.l: Deleted.
	* steps.h: Remove references to texte_ibmpc.

	* steps.h: Remove DONT_LEX conditionals; merged.c is always
	available for installation.

Wed Jul  4 19:01:56 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* all: Copyright directly assigned to the FSF.

Mon Mar 26 13:19:24 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* txteasci.l, txteibmp.l, txtelat1.l: Change occurrences of a NUL
	terminated cursor by a counter from 0 to yyleng-1.  This will
	insure proper transmission of NULs through Flex, which can now
	handle them.

	* mergelex.awk: Make use of -8 option of Flex 2.2 alpha, adjust
	documentation, insure proper pre-declarations of Flex variables
	yytext, yyleng, yyint and yyout.

Fri Mar 23 19:24:08 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* recode.c (execute_popen_sequence): Get rid of unused variables.

	* recode.c (code_index): Change index to counter, because on BSD
	index is a library function.

Fri Mar 16 10:17:48 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* Version 3.1.

Thu Mar 15 19:22:53 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* version.c, recode.c (usage_and_exit): Change -V to -C to give
	the Copyright conditions, print version identification.

	* txtelat1.l: Real strange bug aroud Flex.  I ought to blindly
	remove the specific case of a capital A with a diaeresis to get
	rid of a `NULL in input' Flex diagnostic.  Doing so, I introduce a
	new bug to get rid of another :-(.

	* all: Added missing prototypes declarations, missing void
	specifications for functions, missing const; removed unused
	variables.
	* common.h: New.

Fri Feb  9 00:20:51 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* recode.c, Makefile: If no files are specified, recode stdin on
	stdout as before.  But if files are specified, each of them is now
	recoded over itself, preserving its time stamps unless -t option
	is used.  To make it work on BSD, split execute_sequence in three,
	get rid of USE_FILES and hide USE_PIPE in the Makefile.  Also, see
	the comment before execute_sequence routines, in recode.c.

	* recode.c (main): Some code for -f, to be written later.

	* recode.c (usage_and_exit): Rewritten.

Mon Feb  5 22:42:54 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@kovic)

	* recode.c (usage): Added commas to improve readability.

	* lat1bang.c: Have lower case output instead of upper case, this
	is more readable.

Sat Feb  3 07:31:50 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@kovic)

	* Version 3.0.1.

	* recode.c: Corrected bugs related to USE_POPEN; recode step path
	is now echoed once, and diaeresis selection is now propagated.

Fri Feb  2 12:58:22 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@kovic)

	* mergelex.awk: Option USE_FPUTC, so to compile merged.c using
	fputc instead of putc.  It will hopefully ease Apollo C compiler,
	which litterally trashes on merged.c.

Sat Jan 27 10:06:09 1990  Francois Pinard  (pinard@kovic)

	* all: Adaptation for Flex.  A few yyleng problems short-circuited
	here and there in some .l's.
	* lexcom.c:  Eliminated.
	* mergelex.awk: New, for merging all .l's into a single merged.l.
	This results in a shorter a.out, by a factor of 2 in fact.
	* asciltex.l, ascitxte.l: Slight adjustments needed to escape <'s
	with backslashes.

	* cdcnasci.c, banglat1.c: Too many putc's, simplified to shorten
	the object modules.

	* recode.c: Temporary files were improperly unlinked.  Addition of
	a -q option (quiet), removal of -d (debug): by default, choosen
	step path is printed on stderr.

	* lat1bang.c: Replacement for disappearing ascibang.l.
	* ascibang.l: Removed.

Sun Nov 19 10:35:00 1989  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* banglat1.c, lat1bang.c, iconibmp.c, cdcnasci.c, ascicdcn.c,
	asciflat.c: Replacements for banglat1.l, ascibang.l, iconibmp.l,
	cdcnasci.l, ascicdcn.l, asciflat.l.  I will get rid of some
	simpler lex routines, to get speed and save space.
	* steps.h, version.c: Various adjustments for the preceeding
	changes.

	* Most files: Removal of the dash to restrict each file name
	into eight character, for MS-DOS.

Fri Nov 10 09:03:11 1989  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* version.c: Added.

	* recode.c: Provision for -V option.

Sun Oct 29 13:02:53 1989  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* Version 3.0.

	* txte-lat1.l, lat1-txte.c: Added.

	* txte-ibmp.l: Capital E with acute accent now stays capital in
	all cases.

	* recode.c: Addition of USE_FILES feature for smaller machines.
	PIPE_OUTSIDE renamed to USE_POPEN, PIPE_INSIDE to USE_PIPE.
	Recognition of short keywords.

	* ltex-asci.l, ltex-lat1.l: \$ now correctly translated into $.

	* History from an old recode.texinfo:

	  August 1988:

		Some tentative new charsets for TeX and texinfo, steps
		merged and made more uniform, usage of Unix pipes
		instead of translating chunks one at a time.

		Loic Dachary first exposed me to Easy French.  Claude
		Goutier, through numerous discussions, was helpful in
		evaluating various work hypotheses.

	  July 1988:

		Ported to BSD Unix, bent to meet most GNU standards.

	  December 1987:

		Ported to Microsoft C, tables frozen instead of being
		computed by auxiliary programs at installation time,
		translation sequences sought at execution time instead
		of built-in in the program.

	  July 1985:

		Adapted in Turbo-Pascal on an IBM-PC, translation
		tables completely redesigned.  Dropping of CAF, RUB
		and INT support; ASCII now used as a common base.

	* History from Cyber `secours,/s=codes,recode' documents:

	  March 1983:

		Version 2.0.

		Merge of features from all versions.  New extensive
		documentation, in French.  Handling of French for 95
		character CDC printers.

	  November 1982:

		Version 1.0.

		Modified to handle NOS (NOS 6/12 code), INT (Intercom 8/12
		code), RUB (7.5 char per word tape format), support of
		EBCDIC translations.  Restructuration into a few main
		modules, one of which is CODES.  Made in preparation for
		the Cray-1 at Canadian Meteorological Center.

	  December 1981:

		Revision of comparison routines for French processing,
		several suggestions from Francine Ouellette.

	  December 1980:

		A few speedups and improvements.  My own definition of
		extended ASCII, quite compatible with various usages at
		Universite' de Montre'al.

	  July 1980:

		Module GEN broken into several modules: ASC (ascii), BNG
		(bang-bang), CAF (format for CAFE project), DPC (usual
		display code), and TEL (TELUM packing).  Made in context
		of some research for the PPMF group and the BLOPS project.

	  January 1980:

		Unified module named GEN and program named GENCOP, in
		Cyber Pascal and assembler, partly inspired from NOS/BE
		Record Manager, partly from Claude Schne'egans' PESTUM
		protocol.

	  Before 1980:

		Several independant programs, most in Cyber COMPASS
		assembler, to handle code conversions.  A few tries to
		get some useful, unified, general approach, but with
		limited success.
