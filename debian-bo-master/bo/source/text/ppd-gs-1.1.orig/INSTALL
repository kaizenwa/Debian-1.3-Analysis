(Short) Installation Notes
==========================

These notes are incomplete. Sorry. The configure script is just used for
setting the installation prefix and the installation program. Sorry
again, it is rather crude...

On Debian Linux, please do install the gs-ppd package that contains
the PPD files and will install them intelligently (localizing them
and adapting them to the paper size effectively used by the Ghostscript
devices).

Installation of the PPD files is mainly done by the ppd-inst.sh script,
which, among other things, renames the PPD files, change the default
paper size to use according to the the way gs was installed, etc...
  Typing `ppd-inst.sh -h' and looking at the top of the script should give
a good idea of what the script does. Some examples of use are in the
README file.

The ppd-updt.sh script, which is installed as update-ppd can be used to
update installed ppd files, for example if you reinstall Ghostscript
with a different page size.
  Typing `update-ppd --interactive' should be sufficient to update your
PPD files.
  Note: this script will localize the PPD files from their english
versions unless the --nocreate options is given, so use it or do not
edit localized PPD files (which is recommended). (In interactive
mode, a question will be asked.)

At your discretion, you can add the lines in the magic.rules file in
your /etc/magic (see magic(5) man page) file. These lines will let
the file(1) command recognize PPD files as such.
