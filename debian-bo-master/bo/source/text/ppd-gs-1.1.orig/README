Foreword
========

If you got this file with Ghostscript, you have a set of PPD files
written in english. Be aware that these PPD files are also distributed
in a package named `gs-ppd-x.y' (where x.y-r indicates a revision)
that can automatically localize these files (and some files provided
by vendors) for different languages (actually, french only...).
  If you are interested in localized PPD files, consider getting the
full package.



Available PostScript Printer Description (PPD) Files
====================================================


PostScript Printer Description File for Ghostscript
---------------------------------------------------

The GS.PPD file (whose long name is Aladdin_Ghostscript.ppd) provides
some generic definitions that can be reused by all PPD files describing
specific drivers of Aladdin Ghostscript.
  The GSA4.PPD and GSA3.PPD files provide definitions for devices that
support page sizes up to A4 and A3, respectively.


PostScript Printer Description Files for the Canon BJC printers
---------------------------------------------------------------

The BJC.PPD file (Canon_BubbleJet_Color.ppd) contains the description of
features common amongst all BJC printers.
  The other supplied PPD files for Canon BJC printers are:

	BJC600.PPD	(Canon_BubbleJet_Color_600.ppd)
	BJC610.PPD	(Canon_BubbleJet_Color_610.ppd)
	BJC4000.PPD	(Canon_BubbleJet_Color_4000.ppd)
	BJC70.PPD	(Canon_BubbleJet_Color_70.ppd)
	BJC800.PPD	(Canon_BubbleJet_Color_800.ppd)
	ASW2400P.PPD	(Apple_StyleWriter_2400_Pro.ppd)

and drive the corresponding printers. Most of these files are here only
for convenient reasons only and describe in fact the same printers
(remember that Ghostscript only has bjc600 and bjc800 drivers).
  Please note that I am not aware of every model and differences between
two given BJC printers, so not all printers are represented here. I am
really interested in getting the list right, so please email me any
relevant information.

PostScript Printer Description Files for the HP DJC and PXL printers
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The DJC.PPD file (HP_DeskJet_Color.ppd) contains the description of
features common amongst all HP printers.
  The other supplied PPD files for HP jet printers are:

	DJ500C.PPD	(HP_DeskJet_500C.ppd)
	DJ540C.PPD	(HP_DeskJet_540C.ppd)
	DJ550C.PPD	(HP_DeskJet_550C.ppd)
	DJ560C.PPD	(HP_DeskJet_560C.ppd)
	DJ1200C.PPD	(HP_DeskJet_1200C.ppd)
	PXL.PPD		(HP_PaintJet_XL.ppd)
	PXL300.PPD	(HP_PaintJet_XL300.ppd)

and drive the corresponding printers. Some of these files are here only
for convenient reasons only and describe in fact the same printers.
  Please note that these files were written from what I got in gs's
devices.doc and in the gdevcdj.c source file. There are no guarantees
that they work.



Installation of the PPD files
=============================

(Please read the INSTALL file as well as these instructions. Thanks.)

If you run a Debian Linux system, please install the gs-ppd package
directly.

First, choose a directory where the PPD files will go (something like
/usr/local/share/ppd for example, which is the default).

If you are on a system where the PPD files names appear in upper case
when you list them, you can install them immediately: the file names are
those used when a PPD file includes another one.
  On other systems, the long file names are preferred. To install the
PPD files with these names, use the supplied ppd-inst.sh script, which
takes the files to install as argument, and eventually the installation
directory and paper kind too (try `ppd-inst.sh -h' for usage). Here are
some examples:

	# Install in /usr/local/share/ppd, getting paper size from gs
	% ppd-inst.sh ppd/*.ppd
	# Same as above, with A4 paper instead of Letter
	% ppd-inst.sh -p A4 ppd/*.ppd
	# Install in /usr/local/lib/ppd with default paper (from gs)
	% ppd-inst.sh -d /usr/local/lib/ppd ppd/*.ppd

(don't type the % character on the command-line, nor the comments).
  If you want to keep short names, change the first variable affectation
in the ppd-inst.sh script.
  (Note: you can use the ppd-inst.sh.in script as well if the ppd-inst.sh
script has not been generated.)

If you can't use ppd-inst.sh and want to change the paper size to reflect
your gs setup, you must do it by hand (see below).



Use of the PPD Files
====================

The PPD files can be used on with document managers or printing systems
supporting PPD files, which includes (but is certainly not limited to):

  - NEXTSTEP systems (presumably OpenStep systems too);

  - Systems with the pslpr(1) command from Adobe's TranScript package;

  - Systems with the psplpr(1) command from my free psptools package
    (available from comp.sources.postscript archives, version 1.2 being
    the latest one at the date of this writing).

The files are not guaranteed to be complete at the moment. Please note
too that NEXTSTEP's printing interface does not correctly enforce
constraints specified in these files (in UIConstraints descriptions):
you must force yourself to use valid combinations of options (this is
not the case if you use psplpr(1) which does enforce constraints).



Localization of the PPD Files
=============================

The localization of the PPD files is made by mean of a sed script, which
is expected to be found in a subdirectory of the locale directory of
the PPD distribution.
  Please have a look at the script in locale/fr_FR for an example.



Customization of the PPD Files
==============================

By default the files say that the paper used is US Letter, and they
use a normalized transfer function.
  If you choose to use A4 printing by default, you must replace Letter by
A4 in lines that match the '\*Default.*: Letter' pattern.

*Note* If you are on a Unix system, you can just do that by giving the
paper name (whose first letter is uppercase) as a second argument to
the `ppd-inst.sh' script.

Some versions of Ghostscript have problems with normalized colors,
which makes them add magenta in gray levels. If you have this problem,
replace the '*DefaultTransfer: Normalized' line by the alternate (correct)
'*DefaultTransfer: Null' line.

Also note that the 'Thick Media' option is implemented by choosing a
value of 120 or 80 (for thick and thin media respectively) for the
MediaWeight feature of the drivers. If you ever change the threshold
for thick media in the driver code, you may need to change the values
in the PPD files too.

All customization should be done using the '*Include: ' feature of PPD
files so that your local changes will be kept if you get an update of
these PPD files.



Where to Find Other PPD Files
=============================

PPD files for nearly all commercially available printers can be found on
Adobe's anonymous FTP site,

	ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/PPDFiles/

If you are working on a NEXTSTEP system, please note that many PPD files
are shipped with your system. They are installed in the system library
folder, /NextLibrary/PrinterTypes, and are available on the NEXTSTEP
user CD-ROM.



Please Contribute Your PPD Files!
=================================

If you did develop a driver for Ghostscript, please consider
contributing a PPD file describing its features. Writing such a file is
really simple and can be done by starting with an existing file, and it
will make the life of the users of your driver much simpler... (But
please have a look to the Canon BubbleJet Color PPD files for example,
and don't forget the special comments `*% GhostscriptNeeded: yes' and
`*% GhostscriptDevice: dev' which are used by the installation script.)
 
Please do email me such PPD file: I will incorporate them in the PPD
archive directory of psptools and also send them to Aladdin for
distribution with Ghostscript.
