<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>This is a user's guide to the SGML-Tools document processing system.  SGML-Tools 
provides a SGML DTD (Document Type Definition) and set of ``replacement files''
which convert the SGML to groff, LaTeX, HTML, GNU info, LyX, and RTF 
source.</P>
<P>SGML-Tools is based heavily on the QWERTZ DTD by Tom Gordon,
<CODE>thomas.gordon@gmd.de</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 About This Document</A></H2>

<P>This document is written using the linuxdoc DTD, which comes with SGML-Tools.  
It contains more or less everything you need to know to write SGML documents 
with this DTD.  See <CODE>example.sgml</CODE> for an example of an SGML document that 
you can use as a model for your own documents.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Why SGML?</A></H2>

<P>I chose SGML for this system because SGML is made specifically for translation
to other formats.  SGML, which stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language,
allows you to specify the <EM>structure</EM> of a document---that is, what kinds
of things make up the document.  You specify the structure of a document with
a DTD (Document Type Definition).  linuxdoc is one DTD that specifies
the structure for Linux HOWTOs and other documents.  QWERTZ is another DTD; the
SGML standard provides DTD's for books, articles, and other generic document
types.</P>
<P>The DTD specifies the names of ``elements'' within the document.  An element
is just a bit of structure---like a section, a subsection, a paragraph,
or even something smaller like <EM>emphasized text</EM>.  Unlike LaTeX, however,
these elements are not in any way intrinsic to SGML itself.  The
linuxdoc DTD happens to define elements that look a lot like 
their LaTeX counterparts---you have sections, subsections, verbatim
``environments'', and so forth.  However, using SGML you can define any kind
of structure for the document that you like.  In a way, SGML is like 
low-level TeX, while the linuxdoc DTD is like LaTeX.</P>
<P>Don't be confused by this analogy.  SGML is <EM>not</EM> a text-formatting system.
There is no ``SGML formatter'' per se.  SGML source is <EM>only</EM> converted
to other formats for processing.  Furthermore, SGML itself is used only to 
specify the document structure.  There are no text-formatting facilities or
``macros'' intrinsic to SGML itself.  All of those things are defined within
the DTD.  You can't use SGML without a DTD, a DTD defines what SGML does.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 How It Works</A></H2>

<P>Here's how processing a document with SGML-Tools 
works.  First, you need a DTD.  I'm using the QWERTZ DTD which was produced,
originally, by a group of people who needed a LaTeX-like DTD.  I've modified
the QWERTZ DTD to produce the linuxdoc DTD for our purposes.  
The DTD simply sets up the structure of the document.  A small portion of
it looks like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;!element article - -
    (titlepag, header?, 
     toc?, lof?, lot?, p*, sect*, 
     (appendix, sect+)?, biblio?) +(footnote)&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This part sets up the overall structure for an ``article'', which is like
a ``documentstyle'' within LaTeX.  The article consists of a titlepage
(<CODE>titlepag</CODE>), an optional header (<CODE>header</CODE>), an optional table of 
contents (<CODE>toc</CODE>), optional lists of figures (<CODE>lof</CODE>) and tables
(<CODE>lot</CODE>), any number of paragraphs (<CODE>p</CODE>), any number of top-level
sections (<CODE>sect</CODE>), optional appendices (<CODE>appendix</CODE>), an optional
bibliography (<CODE>biblio</CODE>) and footnotes (<CODE>footnote</CODE>).  </P>
<P>As you can see, the DTD doesn't say anything about how the document should
be formatted or what it should look like.  It just defines what parts make
up the document.  Elsewhere in the DTD the structure of the 
<CODE>titlepag</CODE>, <CODE>header</CODE>, <CODE>sect</CODE>, and other elements are defined.  </P>
<P>You don't need to know anything about the syntax of
the DTD in order to write documents.  I'm just presenting it so you know
what it looks like and what it does.  You <EM>do</EM> need to be familiar with
the document <EM>structure</EM> that the DTD defines.  If not, you might
violate the structure when attempting to write a document, and be very
confused about the resulting error messages.  We'll describe the
structure of SGML documents in detail later.</P>
<P>The next step is to write a document using the structure defined by the
DTD.  Again, the linuxdoc DTD makes documents look a lot like
LaTeX---it's very easy to follow.  In SGML jargon a single document written
using a particular DTD is known as an ``instance'' of that DTD.  </P>
<P>In order to translate the SGML source into another format (such as LaTeX
or groff) for processing, the SGML source (the document that you wrote)
is <EM>parsed</EM> along with the DTD by the SGML <EM>parser</EM>.
I'm using the <CODE>sgmls</CODE> parser by James Clark, <CODE>jjc@jclark.com</CODE>, who
also happens to be the author of <CODE>groff</CODE>.  We're in good hands.
The parser (<CODE>sgmls</CODE>) simply picks through your document and 
verifies that it follows the structure set forth by the DTD.  It also spits out
a more explicit form of your document, with all ``macros'' and elements
expanded, which is understood by <CODE>sgmlsasp</CODE>, the next part of the
process.  </P>
<P><CODE>sgmlsasp</CODE> is responsible for converting the output of <CODE>sgmls</CODE> to
another format (such as LaTeX).  It does this using <EM>replacement files</EM>,
which describe how to convert elements in the original SGML document into
corresponding source in the ``target'' format (such as LaTeX or groff).  </P>
<P>For example, part of the replacement file for LaTeX looks like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;itemize&gt;    +    &quot;\\begin{itemize}   +
&lt;/itemize&gt;   +    &quot;\\end{itemize}    +
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Which says that whenever you begin an <CODE>itemize</CODE> element in the 
SGML source, it should be replaced with 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
\begin{itemize}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

in the LaTeX source.  (As I said, elements in the DTD
are very similar to their LaTeX counterparts).  </P>
<P>So, to convert the SGML to another format, all you have to do is write
a new replacement file for that format that gives the appropriate 
analogies to the SGML elements in that new format.  In practice, it's not
that simple---for example, if you're trying to convert to a format that
isn't structured at all like your DTD, you're going to have trouble.  In 
any case, it's much easier to do than writing individual parsers and
translators for many kinds of output formats; SGML provides a generalized
system for converting one source to many formats.</P>
<P>Once <CODE>sgmlsasp</CODE> has completed its work, you have LaTeX source which
corresponds to your original SGML document, which you can format using
LaTeX as you normally would.  Later in this document I'll give examples
and show the commands used to do the translation and formatting.  You can
do this all on one command line.</P>
<P>But first, I should describe how to install and configure the software.</P>
