<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Writing Documents With SGML-Tools</A></H2>

<P>For the most part, writing documents using the SGML-Tools DTD is very
simple, and somewhat like LaTeX.  However, there are some caveats to watch
out for.  In this section I'll give an introduction on writing SGML documents.
See the file <CODE>example.sgml</CODE> for a SGML example document (and tutorial)
which you can use as a model when writing your own documents.  Here I'm just going
to discuss the various features of SGML, but the source is not very 
readable as an example.  Instead, print out the source (as well as the
formatted output) for <CODE>example.sgml</CODE> so you have a real live case to
refer to.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Basic Concepts</A></H2>

<P>Looking at the source of the example document, you'll notice right off
that there are a number of ``tags'' marked within angle brackets
(<CODE>&lt;</CODE> and <CODE>&gt;</CODE>).  A tag simply specifies the beginning or end
of an element, where an element is something like a section, a paragraph,
a phrase of italicized text, an item in a list, and so on.  Using a tag
is like using a LaTeX command such as <CODE>\item</CODE> or 
<CODE>\section{...}</CODE>.</P>
<P>As a simple example, to produce <B>this boldfaced text</B>, I typed
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
As a simple example, to produce &lt;bf&gt;this boldfaced text&lt;/bf&gt;, ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

in the source.  <CODE>&lt;bf></CODE> begins the region of bold text, and
<CODE>&lt;/bf></CODE> ends it.  Alternately, you can use the abbreviated form
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
As a simple example, to produce &lt;bf/this boldfaced text/, ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which encloses the bold text within slashes.  (Of course, you'll need to
use the long form if the enclosed text contains slashes, such as the
case with Unix filenames).  </P>
<P>There are other things to watch out with respect to special characters 
(that's why you'll notice all of these bizarre-looking ampersand 
expressions if you look at the source; I'll talk about those shortly).</P>
<P>In some cases, the end-tag for a particular element is optional.  For
example, to begin a section, you use the <CODE>&lt;sect></CODE> tag, 
however, the end-tag for the section (which could appear at the end of
the section body itself, not just after the name of the section!) 
is optional and implied when you start another section of the same depth.
In general you needn't worry about these details; just follow the model
used in the tutorial (<CODE>example.sgml</CODE>).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Special Characters</A></H2>

<P>Obviously, the angle brackets are themselves special characters in the
SGML source.  There are others to watch out for.  For example, let's say 
that you wanted to type an expression with angle brackets around it,
as so: <CODE>&lt;foo></CODE>.  In order to get the left angle bracket, you
must use the <CODE>&amp;lt;</CODE> element, which is a ``macro'' that expands
to the actual left-bracket character.  Therefore, in the source, I typed
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
angle brackets around it, as so: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Generally, something beginning with an ampersand is a special macro.  For
example, there's <CODE>&amp;percnt;</CODE> to produce %, 
<CODE>&amp;verbar;</CODE> to produce |, and so on.  For all 
``special characters'' there exist these ampersanded-entities to represent
them.  </P>
<P>Usually, you don't need to use the ampersand macro to get a special
character, however, in some cases it is necessary.  The most commonly used
are:
<UL>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;amp;</CODE> for the ampersand (&amp;), </LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;lt;</CODE> for a left bracket (&lt;),</LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;gt;</CODE> for a right bracket (&gt;),</LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;etago;</CODE> for a left bracket with a slash 
(<CODE>&lt;/</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;dollar;</CODE> for a dollar sign ($),</LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;num;</CODE> for a hash (#),</LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;percnt;</CODE> for a percent (%),</LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;tilde;</CODE> for a tilde (~),</LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>``</CODE> and <CODE>''</CODE> for quotes, or use
<CODE>&amp;dquot</CODE> for &quot;.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>For a complete list of special characters, look at one of the replacement
files.  Usually LaTeX complains the most about special characters, so
paging through <CODE>$SGMLTOOLSLIB/rep/latex/general</CODE> would be a 
good place to start.  <CODE>$SGMLTOOLSLIB</CODE> is defined at the beginning 
of the SGML conversion scripts.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Verbatim and Code Environments</A></H2>

<P>While we're on the subject of special characters, I might as well mention
the verbatim ``environment'' used for including literal text in the output
(with spaces and indentation preserved, and so on).  The 
<CODE>verb</CODE> element is used for this; it looks like the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;verb&gt;
 Some literal text to include as example output.
&lt;/verb&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>verb</CODE> environment doesn't allow you to use <EM>everything</EM>
within it literally.  Specifically, you must do the following within
<CODE>verb</CODE> environments.
<UL>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;ero;</CODE> to get an ampersand, </LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>&amp;etago;</CODE> to get <CODE>&lt;/</CODE>,</LI>
<LI>Don't use <CODE>\end{verbatim}</CODE> within a <CODE>verb</CODE>
environment, as this is what LaTeX uses to end the <CODE>verbatim</CODE> 
environment.  (In the future, it should be possible to hide the underlying
text formatter entirely, but the parser doesn't support this feature yet.) </LI>
</UL>

The <CODE>code</CODE> environment is much just like the <CODE>verb</CODE> environment,
except that horizontal rules are added to the surrounding text, as so:
<HR>
<PRE>
Here is an example code environment.
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>You should use the <CODE>tscreen</CODE> environment around any <CODE>verb</CODE> environments,
as so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;tscreen&gt;&lt;verb&gt;
Here is some example text.  
&lt;/verb&gt;&lt;/tscreen&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<CODE>tscreen</CODE> is an environment that simply indents the text and sets the 
sets the default font to <CODE>tt</CODE>.  This makes examples look much nicer, both
in the LaTeX and plain text versions.  You can use <CODE>tscreen</CODE>
without <CODE>verb</CODE>, however, if you use any special characters in your 
example you'll need to use both of them.  <CODE>tscreen</CODE> does nothing to 
special characters.  See <CODE>example.sgml</CODE> for examples.</P>
<P>The <CODE>quote</CODE> environment is like <CODE>tscreen</CODE>, except that it does
not set the default font to <CODE>tt</CODE>.  So, you can use <CODE>quote</CODE> for
non-computer-interaction quotes, as in:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;quote&gt;
Here is some text to be indented, as in a quote.
&lt;/quote&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which will generate:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here is some text to be indented, as in a quote.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Overall Document Structure</A></H2>

<P>Before we get too in-depth with details, I'm going to describe the
overall structure of a document as defined by the DTD.
Look at <CODE>example.sgml</CODE> for a good example of how a document is set up.</P>

<H3>The Preamble</H3>

<P>In the document ``preamble'' you set up things such as the title
information and document style: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;!doctype linuxdoc system&gt;

&lt;article&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Linux Foo HOWTO
&lt;author&gt;Norbert Ebersol, &lt;tt/norb@baz.com/
&lt;date&gt;v1.0, 9 March 1994
&lt;abstract&gt;
This document describes how to use the &lt;tt/foo/ tools to frobnicate
bar libraries, using the &lt;tt/xyzzy/ relinker.
&lt;/abstract&gt;

&lt;toc&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The elements should go more or less in this order.  The first line tells
the SGML parser to use the linuxdoc DTD.  The <CODE>&lt;article></CODE>
tag forces the document to use the ``article'' document style.  (The 
original QWERTZ DTD defines ``report'' and ``book'' as well; I haven't
tweaked these for use with SGML-Tools).</P>
<P>The <CODE>title</CODE>, <CODE>author</CODE>, and <CODE>date</CODE> tags should be obvious; in the
<CODE>date</CODE> tag include the version number and last modification time of
the document.</P>
<P>The <CODE>abstract</CODE> tag sets up the text to be printed at the top of the
document, <EM>before</EM> the table of contents.  If you're not going to
include a table of contents (the <CODE>toc</CODE> tag), you probably don't
need an <CODE>abstract</CODE>.</P>

<H3>Sectioning And Paragraphs</H3>

<P>After the preamble, you're ready to dive into the document.  The following
sectioning commands are available:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>sect</CODE>: For top-level sections (i.e.  1, 2, and so on.) </LI>
<LI><CODE>sect1</CODE>: For second-level subsections (i.e.  1.1, 1.2, and so on.)</LI>
<LI><CODE>sect2</CODE>: For third-level subsubsections.</LI>
<LI><CODE>sect3</CODE>: For fourth-level subsubsubsections.</LI>
<LI><CODE>sect4</CODE>: For fifth-level subsubsubsubsections.</LI>
</UL>

These are roughly equivalent to their LaTeX counterparts <CODE>section</CODE>,
<CODE>subsection</CODE>, and so on.</P>
<P>After the <CODE>sect</CODE> (or <CODE>sect1</CODE>, <CODE>sect2</CODE>, etc.) tag comes the
name of the section.  For example, at the top of this document, after
the preamble, comes the tag:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;sect&gt;Introduction
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

And at the beginning of this section (Sectioning and paragraphs), there
is the tag:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;sect2&gt;Sectioning And Paragraphs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

After the section tag, you begin the body of the section.  However, you
must start the body with a <CODE>&lt;p></CODE> tag, as so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;sect&gt;Introduction
&lt;p&gt;
This is a user's guide to the SGML-Tools document processing...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This is to tell the parser that you're done with the section title
and are ready to begin the body.  Thereafter, new paragraphs are started
with a blank line (just as you would do in TeX).  For example,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Here is the end of the first paragraph.

And we start a new paragraph here.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

There is no reason to use <CODE>&lt;p></CODE> tags at the beginning of
every paragraph; only at the beginning of the first paragraph after
a sectioning command.</P>

<H3>Ending The Document</H3>

<P>At the end of the document, you must use the tag:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;/article&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>to tell the parser that you're done with the <CODE>article</CODE> element (which
embodies the entire document).  </P>

<H2><A NAME="cross-ref"></A> <A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Cross-References</A></H2>

<P>Now we're going to move onto other features of the system.  
Cross-references are easy.  For example, if you want to make a
cross-reference to a certain section, you need to label that section
as so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;sect1&gt;Introduction&lt;label id=&quot;sec-intro&quot;&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You can then refer to that section somewhere in the text using the
expression:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
See section &lt;ref id=&quot;sec-intro&quot; name=&quot;Introduction&quot;&gt; for an introduction.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This will replace the <CODE>ref</CODE> tag with the section number labeled
as <CODE>sec-intro</CODE>.  The <CODE>name</CODE> argument to <CODE>ref</CODE> is necessary for
groff and HTML translations.  The groff macro set used by SGML-Tools 
does not currently support cross-references, and it's often nice to refer 
to a section by name instead of number.  </P>
<P>For example, this section is 
<A HREF="#cross-ref">Cross-References</A>.</P>
<P>There is also a <CODE>url</CODE> element for Universal Resource Locators, or
URLs, used on the World Wide Web.  This element should be used to refer
to other documents, files available for FTP, and so forth.  For
example,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
You can get the Linux HOWTO documents from 
&lt;url url=&quot;http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/&quot; 
   name=&quot;The Linux HOWTO INDEX&quot;&gt;.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>url</CODE> argument specifies the actual URL itself.  A link to the
URL in question will be automatically added to the HTML document.
The optional <CODE>name</CODE> argument specifies the text that should be anchored to
the URL (for HTML conversion) or named as the description of the
URL (for LaTeX and groff).  If no <CODE>name</CODE> argument is given, the
URL itself will be used.</P>
<P>For example, you can get the SGML-Tools package from<BR>
<CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/text/sgml-tools-0.99.0.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/text/sgml-tools-0.99.0.tar.gz</A></CODE>.</P>
<P>A useful variant of this is <CODE>htmlurl</CODE>, which suppresses rendering of
the URL part in every context except HTML.  What this is useful for
is things like a person's email addresses; you can write
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;htmlurl url=&quot;mailto:esr@snark.thyrsus.com&quot;
      name=&quot;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&quot;&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and get ``esr@snark.thyrsus.com'' in text output rather than the
duplicative ``esr@snark.thyrsus.com &lt;mailto:esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;''
but still have a proper URL in HTML documents.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Fonts</A></H2>

<P>Essentially, the same fonts supported by LaTeX are supported
by SGML-Tools.  Note, however, that the conversion to 
plain text (through <CODE>groff</CODE>) does away with the font 
information.  So, you should use fonts 
as much as possible, for the benefit of the conversion to LaTeX.
But don't depend on the fonts to get a point across in the plain
text version.  </P>
<P>In particular, the <CODE>tt</CODE> tag described above can be used to
get constant-width ``typewriter'' font which should be used for
all e-mail addresses, machine names, filenames, and so on.  
Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Here is some &lt;tt&gt;typewriter text&lt;/tt&gt; to be included in the document.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Equivalently:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Here is some &lt;tt/typewriter text/ to be included in the document.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Remember that you can only use this abbreviated form if the enclosed
text doesn't contain slashes.</P>
<P>Other fonts can be achieved with <CODE>bf</CODE> for <B>boldface</B> and <CODE>em</CODE> 
for <EM>italics</EM>.  Several other fonts are supported as well, but
I don't suggest you use them, because we'll be converting these
documents to other formats such as HTML which may not support them.
Boldface, typewriter, and italics should be all that you need.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Lists</A></H2>

<P>There are various kinds of supported lists.  They are:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>itemize</CODE> for bulleted lists such as this one.</LI>
<LI><CODE>enum</CODE> for numbered lists.</LI>
<LI><CODE>descrip</CODE> for ``descriptive'' lists.  </LI>
</UL>

Each item in an <CODE>itemize</CODE> or <CODE>enum</CODE> list must be marked
with an <CODE>item</CODE> tag.  Items in a <CODE>descrip</CODE> are marked with <CODE>tag</CODE>.
For example,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;itemize&gt;
&lt;item&gt;Here is an item.
&lt;item&gt;Here is a second item.
&lt;/itemize&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Looks like this:
<UL>
<LI>Here is an item.</LI>
<LI>Here is a second item.</LI>
</UL>

Or, for an <CODE>enum</CODE>,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;enum&gt;
&lt;item&gt;Here is the first item.
&lt;item&gt;Here is the second item.
&lt;/enum&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You get the idea.  Lists can be nested as well; see the example document
for details.</P>
<P>A <CODE>descrip</CODE> list is slightly different, and slightly ugly, but
you might want to use it for some situations:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;descrip&gt;
&lt;tag/Gnats./ Annoying little bugs that fly into your cooling fan.
&lt;tag/Gnus./ Annoying little bugs that run on your CPU.
&lt;/descrip&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

ends up looking like:
<DL>
<DT><B>Gnats.</B><DD><P>Annoying little bugs that fly into your cooling fan.</P>
<DT><B>Gnus.</B><DD><P>Annoying little bugs that run on your CPU.</P>
</DL>
</P>
