This directory contains documentation for the system: 
o guide.sgml is the SGML source for the SGML-Tools User's Guide
o guide.txt is formatted plain ASCII
o guide.dvi is DVI
o guide.ps.gz is gzipped PostScript
o guide.info is in GNU info format
o guide.lyx is LyX format
o html/ contains the HTML version
o rtf/ contains the RTF version

You should read one of the formatted versions first - it explains how to 
install the software and how to write and format documents using the system.

Also, there's example.sgml, which is a simple SGML example. You should
format this example (instructions for doing so in the User's Guide) and 
print it out, along with the source, and use it as a model for writing
your own SGML docs. You can also grab the SGML sources for the Linux HOWTOs 
from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/sgml. These 
documents together will give you a good start on using the system.
