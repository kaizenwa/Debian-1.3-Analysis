Encoding:
- Proposal (somebody mentioned it and it was considered a good idea)
* Worked on (somebody took ownership)
! Testing (it's in the source tree, test it!)
+ Completed (testing went fine)
? Long-standing (is this still a viable thing/not done already ?)

============================================  
? do we really need "expand $TABS"
? tables!
! maybe a global option for languages, expand the -g option for german on 
  sgml2latex to use alternate .sty files (Most of it. Maybe introduce 
  \usepackage{babel}? - CdG)
! there has got to be a better option for A4 paper, maybe using <dina4>
  (it's not the job of an SGML file to decide on what paper it must
  be printed - all LaTeX options should now work correctly, so we can
  remove <dina4>).
! check for .SGML and .sgml files in sgml2foo scripts
! autoconfiguration for SP
- switch to Perl. Convert all the sed and awk scripts in order to increase
  portability. Integrate external Perl scripts in order to increase
  efficiency. 
- figures for those formats that can handle them.
- make sure Perl scripts pass '-w' flag.
- support other character sets than latin1 (ISO 8859-1). Start out simple with
  the latin-n alternatives.
- --output-directory switch so the output files aren't automatically put
  in $(basename input-file).
