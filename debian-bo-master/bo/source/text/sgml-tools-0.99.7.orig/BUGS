Encoding: 
- Bug (somebody reported it)
* Worked on (somebody took ownership)
! Testing (it's in the source tree, test it!)
+ Completed (testing went fine)
? Long-standing (is this still a bug ?)

============================================
? . at beginning of line in groff 
? fix -man so it'll work for latin1, too 

- <tscreen><verb> doesn't keep indentation with sgml2txt (reported by
  Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com> on 09-Feb-1997).

- <sect1> "Blah"  or <sect1> &dquot;Blah&dquot; with sgml2txt
  or sgml2txt -l (latin1) results in an output like this
    1.1. Blah"
  i.e. the first quotation mark gets lost (reported by
  Bernd Kreimeier <bk@gamers.org> on 10-Feb-1997).
 
- (UW) driver.pl is not configured correctly ($prefix is "/usr/local")
- (UW) The scripts in "bin" are not configured (e.g. sgmlcheck)

  (CdG - this is in case you install someplace else, according to Ulrich. Didn't
  verify this yet)

- (UW) There are warnings during make:
	make[1]: Entering directory `/old/sgml-tools-0.99.4/rtf-fix'
	flex -t rtf2rtf.l>rtf2rtf.c
	"rtf2rtf.l", line 339: warning, rule cannot be matched
	"rtf2rtf.l", line 340: warning, rule cannot be matched
	gcc -O -o rtf2rtf rtf2rtf.c -lfl
	make[1]: Leaving directory `/old/sgml-tools-0.99.4/rtf-fix'
  I'm using flex 2.5.4.

  (Note by CdG - I rather have rtf2rtf in Perl just like html2html)

- (UW) sgml2txt produces a lot of
  "general entity .. not defined and no default entity"
  "warning: numeric expression expected (got `T')",
  "warning: `[' not defined", "escape character ignored before `T'",
  "warning: indent cannot be negative", "can't find special character `AN'",
  "normal or special character expected (got a space)",
  "warning: `..' not defined"
  Despite of that errors the exit code is 0 (zero).

- sgml2latex generates several problems:
	LaTeX Warning: Unused global option(s):
	    [english].

	! LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter.

	See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
	Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
	 ...                                              
                                                  
	l.617 ... '} & rcub &  \} & rpar &  ) & rsqb &  \]

  (CdG - the [english] is there in preparation of \usepackage{babel}. Anything
  against this?)

- (UW) sgml2info produces several error messages:
	Making info file `manual.info' from `/tmp/sgmltmp.manual3318.4'.
	/tmp/sgmltmp.manual3318.4:11: Misplaced `{'.
  With the source line "Why Not Just Use {\LaTeX}?" I guess the braces are not
  handled properly.

! (UW) some temporary files (nsgmls output) are not deleted
  (e.g. sgmltmp.manual3304.2)

- (Cdg) General bug that's probably been around for a while:
 
    <descrip>
    <tag/&lsqb;foobar&rsqb;/ doesn't seem to get along with sgml2latex.
    </descrip>
 
  Reported by Andre Schoorl <aschoorl@engr.UVic.CA> on 12-Mar-1997.
