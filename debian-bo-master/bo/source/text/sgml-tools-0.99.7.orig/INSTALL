*** This file describes the installation of the sgml-tools package ***

You need to do the following things to get sgml-tools installed:

o Configure SGML-Tools for your system:

     ./configure

  You can specify different installation prefixes during installation,
  the default prefix is `/usr/local'. For example:
  install linuxdoc-sgml to `/usr':

     ./configure --prefix=/usr

  If you have sgmls-1.1 and or sp-1.1.1 already installed, you can leave
  out their compilation:

     ./configure --with-installed-sgmlsasp --with-installed-nsgmls

o Compile SGML-Tools:

    make

o Install SGML-Tools:

    make install

  (You must probably be root to install in /usr/local and other system
  directories).

  It might be a good idea to install in a temporary directory for testing,
  first (/tmp perhaps).

o the contrib directory has some interesting patches and scripts that may be
  useful to you.

o there is a guide on the sgml-tools documentation  directory, it 
  describes how to use this package, read it next...
