.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Cstocs is a simple utility to change encoding of given text.
It takes files \fI[ file ... ]\fP
(if none is specified, then it uses standard input), assuming that 
they are encoded in \fIsrc_encoding\fP,
and tries to reencode it into \fIdst_encoding\fP.
Result is written to standard output. I.e., semantics of
\fI[ file ... ]\fP is the same as in \fBcat\fP(1).
.PP
There are two versions of cstocs in cstocs 3.0 package: cstocs.pl written
in Perl 5, and cstocs.awk writen in GNU awk. The install script will
link cstocs.pl as csttocs, if perl is present, and cstocs.awk
as cstocs otherwise. The cstocs.awk is mostly the same program
as cstocs 2.2. See also the BUGS section.
.PP
Characters, that are not defined in \fIsrc_encoding\fP, are passed
to standard output unchanged.
.PP
If source text contains character, that is defined in \fIsrc_encoding\fP
but not in \fIdst_encoding\fP, it can be handled several ways.
For example, character "e with caron" (symbol ecaron), and
"d with caron" (symbol dcaron)  are included in
iso-8859-2 encoding, but not in iso-8859-1. If you will do reencoding
of 8859-2 text to 8859-1, you may want to do one of the following actions:
.TP
.B "1)"
Do not produce any output instead of "ecaron" symbol.
.TP
.B "2)"
Substitute some string (possibly a space) instead of both ecaron and dcaron.
.TP
.B "3)"
Substitute a letter "d" instead of dcaron, and "e" instead of ecaron.
It is even possible to substitute string instead of symbol, so you can
replace the "AE" Latin character with string "AE" (letter "A", and letter "E").
Or you can replace a "plusminus sign" with a string "+/-".
These substitutions are described in \fBaccent\fP file.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-\-dir directory"
Encoding files are taken from \fIdirectory\fP
instead of default /usr/local/lib/cstocs. If \fBCSTOCSDIR\fP
environment variable is set, it is used instead. The highest priority
has \fI\-\-dir\fP option, next is \fBCSTOCSDIR\fP
and if none of the above two is used, \fBcstocs\fP
uses the default directory /usr/local/lib/cstocs.
.TP
.I "\-\-fillstring string"
If source text contains character, that is defined in \fIsrc_encoding\fP
but not in \fIdst_encoding\fP nor in \fBaccent\fP file,
it is replaced by \fIstring\fP.  Default action is to replace such a
character with space.
.TP
.I "\-\-null"
Completely equivalent to \fI\-\-fillstring ""\fP.
.TP
.I "\-\-nochange"
Do not look to \fBaccent\fP file. If you use both \fI\-\-null\fP and
\fI\-\-nochange\fP, \fBcstocs\fP will work after the \fB1)\fP scheme.
Using \fI\-\-null\fP and \fI\-\-fillstring\fP makes \fBcsotcs\fP
working after \fB2)\fP scheme.
.TP
.I "\-\-onebyone"
Use only these rules from \fBaccent\fP file, which rewrite symbol
to exactly one character. If this option is specified, 
character "ecaron" will be rewritten to "e", but "AE" character will not
be rewritten to "AE" string. This is the default option.
.TP
.I "\-\-onebymore"
Use all rules from \fBaccent\fP file.

.SH "THE NAME OF THE GAME"
Name \fBcstocs\fP is an acronym of `czech+slovak to czech+slovak'.
This name is stolen from cstocs.exe utility,
which was used for similar purposes under M$-DOS.

Jan "Yenya" Kasprzak <kas@muni.cz>

Some tables were contributed an corrected by
Jan Pazdziora <adelton@fi.muni.cz>

The mac, macce and 1252 tables, as well as some bug fixes were contributed
by Jiri Kvarda <kvarda@vc.cvut.cz>

Many people on the Net sends me fixes for the encoding tables.
.SH BUGS
cstocs.awk is written in \fBgawk\fP(1). It was developed using GNU gawk 2.15.
I am not sure, if it uses any gawk-specific stuff. If you see the
"syntax error" message from awk, you should get and use GNU awk or nawk.
.TP
cstocs.awk appends newline at the end of output file, even if the input
file's last line does not end with a newline.
.TP
cstocs.awk is a terribly slow. This is probably because gawk uses
FP arithmetic even for integers. On my machine
the Perl version was 45-times faster than the AWK version in
the default case and more than 2-times faster in --onebymore case.
.TP
Man page an option names can be confusing :-(
