	*** CSTOCS 3.0 -- Reencoding utility ***
	****************************************

WHAT'S THAT?
    CSTOCS is utility, which helps you to change encoding of your texts.
    For example, you have ISO-Latin2 (iso8859-2) encoded file text.lat2,
    and want it to be printed in cheap matrix printer, which understands
    only 7-bit ASCII encoding. You can simply do something like that:

    prompt$ cstocs il2 ascii <text.lat2 | lpr -Pcheap_printer

    Or, you want to run this text through TeX, which have T1 (cork)
    encoded fonts. You may do:

    prompt$ cstocs il2 cork <text.lat2 >text.tex
    prompt$ tex text.tex

WHERE TO FIND IT?
    Actual version of cstocs is included in cs-tools package, found at
    ftp://ftp.fi.muni.cz/pub/UNIX/localization/charsets/

THE NAME OF THE GAME
    Name `cstocs' is an acronym of `czech/slovak to czech/slovak'.
    This name is stolen from cstocs.exe utility,
    which was used for similar purposes under M$-DOS.
    
HOW TO INSTALL IT?
    Run install.sh script, which copies cstocs' files on their places.

    There are two versions of cstocs: Perl5 one and GNU AWK one. 
    The install.sh script will try to determine whether you have Perl
    installed and makes a link named "/usr/bin/cstocs" to $LIBDIR/cstocs.pl
    or $LIBDIR/cstocs.awk if there is no Perl installed.
    
    cstocs.awk script is written in GNU AWK language, so you must have gawk
    installed. Cstocs 3.0 was developed using GNU awk 2.15 and 3.0.
    I don't know, if it uses any nawk- or gawk-specific stuff. If you
    see awk's syntax error when running cstocs, you should use newer
    version of awk, than you have. If you then will see such a message
    again, send me mail about it.
