FTP Note, figlet release 2.1.1, 25 Aug 1994
-------------------------------------------

Note: figlet 2.1.1 is a minor revision of figlet 2.1.  The files
FTP-NOTE, README, chkfont.c, figlet.c, figlist and showfigfonts have
been changed.  All other files are identical with the 2.1 release.

For those making figlet 2.1.1 available by anonymous FTP: please put
the version number (2.1.1) in the filename, so that FTP'ers can know
they're not getting the same program they already have.

Also, for those who maintain archives of figlet fonts, please note that
all of the standard fonts have been changed, as of release 2.1, to
include non-ASCII characters.  These fonts are the following:

big.flf
block.flf
bubble.flf
digital.flf
lean.flf
mini.flf
script.flf
shadow.flf
slant.flf
small.flf
smscript.flf
smshadow.flf
smslant.dld
standard.flf
term.flf

The new versions of these fonts can be identified by the words "figlet
release 2.1" somewhere in the first few lines.  These fonts are
included in the standard figlet 2.1.1 package, and are also available by
anonymous FTP from "ftp.nicoh.com", in directory "pub/figlet/fonts/ours".
