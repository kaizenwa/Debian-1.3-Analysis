DESCRIPTION: Frank, Ian & Glenn's Letters.
 Figlet is a program that creates large characters out of ordinary screen
 characters. It can create characters in many different styles and can
 kern and "smush" these characters together in various ways. Figlet
 output is generally reminiscent of the sort of "signatures" many people
 like to put at the end of e-mail and Usenet messages.
