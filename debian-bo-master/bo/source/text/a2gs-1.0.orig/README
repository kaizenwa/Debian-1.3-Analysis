OK, I hate short readme files, but ...

Anyways this is a short program to convert text into
a format readable by gs and many postscript printers.
For right now the actual text formating is done by an
execl call to fold, expand, pr, and sed.  Originally
I intended to do this in the "c" code as well, but
unless you want to process a large number of files
the difference in speed would be neglishable anyways.


To compile:
   make a2gs


To install:
   make install


I've designed the makefile to automatically make
dependancies.
