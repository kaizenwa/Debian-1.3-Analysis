<!-- I used to think this was illegal, but I don't any more.  Firstly
it doesn't fall within the scope of 420:1-4.  I think this can be
reconciled with 42);5-14, by giving a narrow meaning to `applies'.  An
exclusion of E only ever applies if a token of type E becomes
contextually required or a start tag for E is encoutered when the
exclusion is in effect.  -->
