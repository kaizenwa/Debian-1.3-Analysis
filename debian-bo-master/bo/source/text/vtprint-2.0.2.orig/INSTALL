INSTALL --  Installation directions for vtprint 2.0
=======

I. What you need

    * an ANSI C compiler (vtprint won't compile without an ANSI C
      compiler, but "unprotoize" might solve this)

    * UNIX or similiar system with one of termios, termio, or sgtty

    * about 10 minutes of your time to install vtprint


II. Before you compile

    * First, you'll need to edit the Makefile.  There are a number
      options, but you'll probably only want/need to change a few of
      them.

    * If your system uses something other than /dev/tty as the tty
      device, change DEVTTY and SEDDEVTTY.  (SED* defines are used
      only in building the man pages.)

    * If you want to place the vtprintcap file somewhere other than
      /usr/local/lib/vtprint/vtprintcap, please change the LIBFILE
      and SEDLIBFILE defines.

    * If you are installing vtprint for a whole system (you are the
      sysadmin), please check/edit the *_DIR destination directories
      and OWNER and GROUP defines (for file ownership).

    * If you are an ordinary user and want to install a *private* copy
      of vtprint, please check/edit the USR_* destination directories.

    * Check the CFLAGS and compiler section.  If your system is old and
      doesn't support POSIX termios, please either define SYSV_TERMIO
      or SGTTY in the CFLAGS.  (Depending on which your system has!)

    * If you wish to rebuild the man pages, please verify that the 
      commands given in MAN_* will produce correct output.

III. Compiling vtprint

    * If you run "make", a vtprint binary should be created.  (Some
      systems make get warning messages, those are probably normal.)

    * If you run "make test" from a station you think should/will work
      with vtprint, a test file should be printed.  Please read 
      "testfile" about this.

IV. Installing vtprint

    * If the above step worked, either do "make install" as "root", or
      do "make userinstall" to install a private copy of vtprint.

    * If you wish to rebuild man pages, you may attempt to do so by
      doing "make man".  (You need 'roff and sed to do this!)

    * Install the man pages by doing "make install.man" or
      "make userinstall.man"

    * Add any definitions you need to the "vtprintcap" file (forward
      your changes to garrett@sciences.sdsu.edu).

    * Read the man pages for vtprint, vtprintcap, and vtprtoff.

    * Use vtprint!

    * Write to "garrett@sciences.sdsu.edu" letting him now how it
      works!  You should fill out an entry for the COMPAT file using
      the template COMPAT.templ if your configuration doesn't already
      appear in the COMPAT file.

    * Enjoy!
