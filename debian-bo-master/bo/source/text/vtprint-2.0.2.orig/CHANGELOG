CHANGELOG
=========

The following changes to vtprint have been made:

2.0.1 -> 2.0.2

Removed: Lots of nonsense in the Makefile.  There is no mail target anymore,
         and install does not attempt to change ownerships anymore.  Also,
         the .SILENT has been removed, so you won't wonder what it did.

2.0 -> 2.0.1

Fixed:   Problem compiling on BSD systems due to use of RAWOUT.  (thanks to
         dolittle@math.toronto.edu for spotting the bug)
Fixed:   Mispelling of "fg" for "fd" in termstate.c (dolittle@math.toronto.edu)
Fixed:   Problem compiling on OSF/1 due to basename symbol conflict (thanks to
         ephelps@carbon.denver.colorado.edu)
Added:   New entries in the COMPAT file thanks to (minh@lis.rch.unimelb.edu.au)
Added:   Option to send mail to the author when installing vtprint.

         dolittle@math.toronto.edu for spotting the bug)
