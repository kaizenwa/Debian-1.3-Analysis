       vvttpprriinntt  is  a  simple  filter that prints ASCII text to a
       printer connected to a terminal or terminal emulator.   It
       uses  terminal  escape sequences to print, and can substi-
       tute for llpprr(1) in circumstances where the printer is  not
       connected directly to the host or available via TCP/IP.

       --bb     Causes  vvttpprriinntt to open the output stream in binary
              modes, overriding any automatic postprocessing done
              by the host (e.g. CR/LF translations).  This has no
              effect if the output stream is not a tty device.

       --BB     Undoes the effect of the --bb option.  Note that this
              does  _n_o_t open the output stream in text mode if it
              would not normally be opened in that mode.

       --cc     Causes vvttpprriinntt to append any linefeeds (ASCII  0xA)
              with  carriage returns (ASCII 0xD).  This is useful
              for printing data from a UNIX or similiar  host  to
              an  MS-DOS system's printer that expects CR/LF line
              termination.

       --CC     Causes vvttpprriinntt to pass  all  carriage  returns  and
              linefeeds unmodified.

       --dd     Use  the tty device file instead of stdout for out-
              put.  This is defined as //ddeevv//ttttyy on  this  system.
              (This  is  operating  system  specific and may vary
              from system to system.) This is  useful  for  using
              vvttpprriinntt  as a pipe called by programs that suppress
              or redirect the stdout stream of the pipe or print-
              ing process.

       --DD     Use the stdout stream for output, rather than a tty
              device file.

       --ee     Forces vvttpprriinntt to ignore the TERM environment vari-
              able and use the builtin control codes instead.

       --EE     Undoes  the  effect  of the --ee option, which allows
              vvttpprriinntt  to   attempt   to   find   an   entry   in
              //uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//vvttpprriinntt//vvttpprriinnttccaapp   for   the  TERM
              value and use the corresponding control codes.

       --ff     Requests vvttpprriinntt to suppress inclusion of formfeeds

              (ASCII 0xC) between multiple files.  Note that this
              has no affect on any formfeeds that may be  present
              in the input files already.

       --FF     Requests  vvttpprriinntt to include formfeeds between mul-
              tiple files specified on the  command-line  and  at
              the end of the last file printed.

       --hh     Print out a simple usage message.

       --ll     Print out the vvttpprriinntt license agreement.

       --LL _v_t_p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p
              Specifies  an  alternate  file  to  use  instead of

       --nn     Causes vvttpprriinntt to  strip  the  CR  from  any  CR/LF
              sequences.   This  will  not affect handling of any
              CRs present elsewhere in the file.

       --NN     Causes vvttpprriinntt to pass  all  carriage  returns  and
              linefeeds unmodified.

       --qq     Quiet  mode.  Suppress various status messages from
              being displayed, useful in situations where vvttpprriinntt
              is used as part of a shell script, for example.

       --QQ     Cancels  the effect of the --qq option, allowing nor-
              mal progress reporting to occur.

       --tt     Force the use of the TERM  variable  to  perform  a
              look  up  of  the  control  sequences to be used in
              //uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//vvttpprriinntt//vvttpprriinnttccaapp.  If an entry  in
              that  file  can't be found, vvttpprriinntt will abort with
              an error.

       --TT _t_e_r_m_t_y_p_e
              Use the value of _t_e_r_m_t_y_p_e instead of the  value  of
              the   TERM  environment  variable  when  performing
              lookups in //uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//vvttpprriinntt//vvttpprriinnttccaapp.

       --VV _d_e_v_i_c_e
              Specifies  an  alternate  device  file  instead  of
              //ddeevv//ttttyy to use.

       vvttpprriinntt  cannot  be  used  to  print files containing non-
       printable characters, as these may  cause  conflicts  with
       the terminal or emulator used.

       When  used  over  a serial (modem) connection, vvttpprriinntt may

       not work properly unless hardware (CTS/RTS)  flow  control
       is  used.   This is due to the fact that most printers are
       slower than serial connections in common use.

       vvttpprriinntt uses terminal escape sequences to print,  and  not
       all  terminal  emulators  support  these sequences, and of
       those that do, some support it differently.  You can  find
       a listing of some of the programs known to work and not to
       work with vvttpprriinntt in the file CCOOMMPPAATT..  The best  thing  to
       do  is  try  your  particular emulator, and find out if it
       works.  The author would appreciate any reports of success
       or  failure,  or  strange behavior.  You can send those to
       him via Internet e-mail.  (See the AAUUTTHHOORR chapter for  how
       to reach him.)

       largely incomplete.  The author would very much appreciate
       it  if  individuals with more information different termi-
       nals would get in contact with him so that support can  be
       added for these terminals in the master archive.

       Do  _n_o_t background this program, as it has no way of know-
       ing when it is in the background and when  it  is  in  the
       foreground.   This will result in your foreground process'
       output being printed as well as the output from vvttpprriinntt..

BBUUGGSS
       vvttpprriinntt  doesn't  handle some signals properly, especially
       the SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals,  which  can't  be  caught
       anyway.   Also  it  doesn't check to see if you have back-
       grounded the process.  The resulting condition  may  leave
       all  output directed to the printer instead of the screen.
       The fix for this condition is to run the provided vvttpprrttooffff
       program  with  no  arguments,  which  will  restore normal
       screen output.  (You probably won't be able  to  see  what
       you're typing while you start vvttpprrttooffff from the shell.)
