This is a file for testing vtprint.  Hopefully it will provide some
insight as to whether your program works correctly or not.  To use, type
"vtprint [options] testfile"

Okay,  are characters lining up?

    ***************************
    * This box should line up *
    ***************************

Now we have to skip to a new page.

This should appear on a second page of the output.

Now answer the following questions:

    1) Did the first page print out completely and correctly?
    2) Were there two pages of output?

If both questions are answered yes, congratulations!   vtprint will work
properly for you!
