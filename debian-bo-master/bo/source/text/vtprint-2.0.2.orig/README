VTPRINT 2.0 
-----------

Welcome to vtprint 2.0!

If you have already installed a previous version of vtprint, installing
this version is almost the same.  

There is a file "INSTALL" which should be read, as it describe step-by-
step how to install vtprint, either as an ordinary user or as a sysadmin.
There is also a FAQ in case you get stuck.  Read it before asking me, since
most questions should be answered there.

You should read the Makefile over, and make sure you are happy with the
destination directories, file ownerships, etc.

After you have compiled vtprint, you can test it by doing "make test".
Read "testfile" if you don't get an obvious result!
