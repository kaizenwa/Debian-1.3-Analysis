What's new in vtprint 2.0 from 1.x?

vtprint-2.0 represents a *complete* rewrite of vtprint.  I decided to change
somewhat the design philosophy, deeming portability to non-UNIX systems to
be really worthless.  Hence, this is probably only compilable on UNIX  or
UNIX-clone systems.  Also, I moved to the "getopt()" facility which
simplified some of the option parsing code.

Here's a list of some of the "user-visible" additions to vtprint:

    1) support for any *terminal* with printer control codes via
       an external library file (see vtprintcap(5).)

    2) support for CR/LF handling directly

    3) support for output to *any* device file via the command line.

    4) support for "session defaults" via an environmental variable
       which can hold command-line options.

    5) optional "binary" mode, overriding CR/LF translations (can only
       be used on terminal devices).

    6) probably other things I can't think of now.
