This directory contains some files to test apsfilter. Note that apsfilter
is now able to print compressed files and those who are compressed using 
gzip. You shouldn't need to uncompress them first before printing ;-)

test.ascii.66-lines	- simple ascii file
test.dvi && sledge.ps	- dvi file with inclusion of ps-picture, a special 
			  feature of dvips
test.dvi.a4		- a typical TeX DIN A 4 page
test.tiger.ps		- ghostscrits tiger in ps form
			  this can be printed as mono and as color picture
umlaut.test		- print this typing lpr -Pascii
			  since umlaute are treated as a data file
