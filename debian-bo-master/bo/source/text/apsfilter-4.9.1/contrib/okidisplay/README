okidisplay is for HPLJ compatible OKI 400ex. They have a programmable 
display. Martin Kraemer (Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de) has made a C Program,
that hacks the current print job into the display of the printer in the 
following form:

	<job>:<user>@<host>

The program okidisplay has to be in apsfilters search path.
Best would be in bin/...

In bin/apsfilter you have to enhance the PRINT_PS variable two times,
~line 346:


	*)	
		# we have a nice non ps printer
		if [ -z "$GS_RESOL" ]
		then
			# default is _not_ to fiddle around with
			# ghostscripts printer driver resolution
			PRINT_PS="	gs				\
					-q				\
					-sDEVICE=${PRINTER}		\
					-sPAPERSIZE=${PAPERSIZE}	\
					-dNOPAUSE			\
					-dSAFER				\
					-sOutputFile=-			\
					-				\
					| okidisplay			\
						\"$JOB:$USER@$HOST\"	"
		else
			# if we urgently need another resolution
			# then we use it (selectable in /etc/apsfilterrc
			# or in $HOME/apsfilterrc)
			PRINT_PS="	gs				\
					-q				\
					-sDEVICE=${PRINTER}		\
					-r${GS_RESOL}			\
					-sPAPERSIZE=${PAPERSIZE}	\
					-dNOPAUSE			\
					-dSAFER				\
					-sOutputFile=-			\
					-				\
					| okidisplay			\
						\"$JOB:$USER@$HOST\"	"
		fi
		;;
