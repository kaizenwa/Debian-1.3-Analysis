	Hi there!

	Anyone following the development of TeX and friends more
	closely will have realized that SOME versions of dvips are NOT
	able to deal with the -D option anymore correctly. 

	This option used to tell dvips which resolution should be used
	for the fonts or to create new fonts via MakeTeXPK. So we
	supply the small script 

		setup_dvips.sh

	to create small config-files that are used by dvips. A rather
	long email-thread with Thomas Esser (check out teTeX for his
	real work!!) helped to take care of some exceptions, and this
	is the "small" result.

	To use dvips with apsfilter just run 

		./bin/setup_dvips.sh

	as root for EACH Printer you intend to use, it'll create small
	config-files for your printers that are read by dvips.

	Another drawback with newer versions of dvips is the
	impossibility to create fonts while being executed from lpr
	due to some small bug in dvips. The only "workaround" is to
	create missing fonts with xdvi or dvips from the commandline
	before printing the document, all other functionality isn't
	affected, meaning you still are able to print dvi-files with
	ps-includes if your apsfilterrc is setup correctly.

	Have fun,
			Thomas & Andreas

	Again Thanks to Thomas Esser who helped clarifying lots of
	hidden details.
