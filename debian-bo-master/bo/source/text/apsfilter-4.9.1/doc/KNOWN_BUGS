1)	If you print multiple files in one command line, i.e.:
		lpr ascii1.txt ascii2.txt ascii3.txt

	and if you use a2ps's feature of printing documents with a 
	small header, containing user id, machine name and file name,
	then each ascii document, that will be processed by a2ps will
	contain the filename ascii1.txt in the header.

2) 	When printing a dvi-file in Landscape-mode this isn't
	recognized and the right border will be chopped off! To
	prevent this some method to determine the bounding-box of the
	largest dvi-page will be needed, so dvips could rotate the
	page so it'll fit on a page!

3)	If your file(1) command (i.e.: the file /etc/magic) doesn't 
	have rules for all file types, that apsfilter knows about,
	then be carefull adding rules in /etc/magic. Try each new 
	entry on the commandline first. Templates for the magic
	file can be found in the template directory.
	Double entries cause trouble !!!! THIS IS IMPORTANT HERE,
	since apsfilter relies on a working file(1) command.

4)	Suns Solaris 1 and 2 file command can't read from a pipe.
	In the src area is a replacement file command, that is
	free (taken from BSD-4.4 Lite, FreeBSD 2.X).

5)      Using gs-3.53, escp2 printers are not supported. This should be
detected or accounted for in later releases (for Debian).
