New Goodies
===========

Apsfilter is now more secure. You have to set INSECURE in /etc/apsfilterrc
as root first otherwise its not possible for users to use the 
custom files $HOME/.apsfilterrc.

There is a new switch DVIPS_RESOL_DorP. Some dvips versions use the P 
and some the D Option to change the printer resolution on the command line.
So if you have trouble printing TeX dvi files using dvips, check this one
first, please ! It defaults now to -D so it runs like a charm with
Thomas Essers teTeX-0.3 package ;-)

Nice Contribution:
okidisplay is for HPLJ compatible OKI 400ex. They have a programmable 
display. Martin Kraemer (Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de) has made a C Program,
that hacks the current print job into the display of the printer in the 
following form: <job>:<user>@<host>
So you can see, what print job currently is active ;-)

WHAT IS APSFILTER
=================

Do you have the German Unix Magazine UnixOpen February 1995 handy ?
Yes ?! Then read the article about apsfilter "Jetzt wird Druck gemacht".
					
APSFILTER is a lineprinter input filter for systems with a BSD-like
printing mechanism (lpd, /etc/printcap), that saves users a lot of work 
when printing different file types wether compressed or not !!!

Additionally it enables non Postscript printers, that are supported
by the free postscript emulator - under the terms of the GPL - 
"ghostscript" (gs), to print postscript files automatically !

With the new apsfilter Version 3.0 its now possible to print 
*compacted* documents directly without unpacking !!! 
The wanted packers/unpackers have to be already installed on your system.

 o Supported packers:

	GZIP, PACK, COMPRESS, FREEZE/MELT

 o Supported file types:

	Postscript
	TeX DVI
	Ascii
	Data (PCL,...)
	GIFF
	TIFF
	Sun Rasterfiles
	FIG
	PNM (pbmplus)

Unix Platforms, that are able to run apsfilter flawlessly
=========================================================

	- FreeBSD 1.X
	- FreeBSD 2.X
	- SUN SPARCSTATIONS, Solaris 1.1.1 (SunOS4) (when using 
		another file command that can read from a pipe)
	- some (not all) Linux Distributions
	  	Slackware V 1.1
		Slackware 2.1.0 (problems with permissions in spooldir)
		LST-1.8 (minor problem, incomplete /etc/magic file)

	- and surely all commercial Unix Systems, 
	  that run a BSD 4.X operating system

==========================================================
These are the sites, where apsfilter versions can be found
==========================================================

(1) This ftp server will also contain beta releases if we are
    currently on the way to a new release

	ftp server:	ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de
	directory :	pub/Linux/local/packages/APS/aps-49.tgz

	ftp server:	sunsite.unc.edu
	directory :	pub/Linux/Incoming/aps-49.tgz

ftp the newest release from there. The current naming scheme for 
apsfilter releases is:		aps-Release.tgz

Beta versions contain the letter B in the version number and
have mostly a number with three digits.
