ChangeLog:
===============================================================================

Montag, 10. Juli 1995 20:45:55 Uhr MET DST Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.GUN.de>
	* released 4.9.1

Montag, 10. Juli 1995 20:45:55 Uhr MET DST Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.GUN.de>
	* FranzJosef Knelangen <fjk@ruf.uni-freiburg.de>
	  "Fatal error: need gs ..." error eliminated in bin/apsfilter

Samstag, 8.Juli 1995, 19:51:37 Uhr MET DST Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.GUN.de>

	* released 4.9

Samstag, 8.Juli 1995, 19:00:47 Uhr MET DST Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.GUN.de>

	* Klaus-Dieter Henkel <henkel@aega84.AAT-F.AEG-F.DE>:
	  can't print PS and ASCII files onto a PS printer, because of 
	  "HAVE_GS = True" checks in the wrong context. Obviously he doesn't 
	  need ghostscript when having a PS printer. Moved the check to the 
	  4th section when creating the PRINT_PS variable.
	  Thanks, this was a important fix !!
	* Andrew Young <aty@mintaka.sdsu.edu>
	  Mr. ispell && grammer checker ;-))
	  fixed some chicken english mistakes ;-))
	* Uwe Bonnes <bon@elektron.ikp.physik.th-darmstadt.de>
	  Fix for a2ps to strip the MS-Dog ^M at end of line in PS files.
	* myself
	  bin/apsfilter: DVIPS_RESOL_DorP, was misspelled in section 2
	* Thomas Esser <te@informatik.uni-hannover.de>
	  fixes for setup_dvips.sh

Thu May  4 13:27:43 MET DST 1995 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.GUN.de>

	* Martin Kraemer <Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de>:
	  Many many things, *thanks*:
	- setupaps removed
	- PRINT_TO_FILE disabled, was only for testing purposes
	- set -x also.
	- Test for empty variables changed ( -z "$XXX" )
	- okidisplay.tar.gz into new contribution dir

Mon May  1 17:41:25 MET DST 1995 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.GUN.de>

	* bin/setup_dvips.sh fixed: RES=RES_X added

Mon May  1 13:54:51 MET DST 1995 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.GUN.de>

	* 4.9 Test release released

	* Since there seem to be two different flavours of dvips program,
	  I introduced a DVIPS_RESOL_DorP Flag, to use -P or -D option when
	  changing print resulution. Defaults to -D for Thomas Essers
	  dvips (teTeX-0.3).

	* Added an INSECURE Flag that can be set in /etc/apsfilterrc
	  globally. Only by setting INSECURE to True, its possible,
	  that users custom configuration file is executed with
	  lpd (sometimes root) Permissions.

Thu Mar  2 20:05:38 1995  Thomas Bueschgens  <sledge@hammer.oche.de>

	* created setup_dvip.sh to support newer versions of dvips. Thanks
	  to Thomas Esser for some metafont-tips.

	* created README.TeX, just first version, but it'll suffice :-)

	* Changed -D (RES) to -P (RES) in apsfilter (DVIPS_OPTS)

Mon Feb  6 19:30:55 MET 1995 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* uphya001@odie.physik2.uni-rostock.de (Lars Koeller)
	  His flavour of file command prompts with
	  "ascii text (with  escape sequences)" when printing
	  PCL (HP command language) files. So the case structure
	  gets an alternative *escape*|*data*). And the case data
	  has to be moved before the case ascii clause.

Tue Jan 31 12:54:07 MET 1995 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* joe@fred.iaas-berlin.de (Joachim Schoenberg):
	  - in 4.9-gamma, typo in line 461, wrong fi at end of a command
	  - added "from $LOGINNAME" in fault filetype (for network print.)

Sat Jan 28 19:10:12 MET 1995 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* joe@fred.iaas-berlin.de (Joachim Schoenberg):
	  print data failed, solution: case *data*)

	* eleminated GS_RESOL in apsfilter script. Trust ghostscripts defaults
	  in its printer driver. If you need it, the set it via apsfilterrc.
	  Modified sample apsfilterrc file.

Mon Jan  2 20:17:49 MET 1995 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* daub@einstein.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de:
	  apsfilter: A2PS_STD_OPTS changed to A2PS_STD_OPTIONS

	* Christoph Junge <chris@cj.in-berlin.de>:
	  esc2 wrong -> escp2, changed in apsfilter
	  added st800, Stylus support.

	* Michael_Nelson <nelson@seahunt.imat.com>
	  FAQ: problems with LJIII and 1 MB Ram when printing
	  with a2ps two pages on one and resol. = 300dpi.
	  Solution: resol 150x150.

	* SETUP: touch SPOOLDIR/lock and chmod 644 for Slackware 
	  2.1.0 necessary.

	* Corey Sweeney <corey@bbs.xnet.com> and many others ...
	  want remote printing functionality ... ;-)
	  Here it is, the ugly hack:
	  bin/apsfilter: when setting REMOTE_PRINTER=True
	  then we print to a printer named remote.
	  So make a printer entry in /etc/printcap for your
	  printer named remote and set the environment variable
	  in bin/apsfilter ( ~ line 55)
	  Please note, now everything is being sent to the 
	  _one_ remote printer ... sorry ... !!!!
	  Added some comments to the FAQ.

	* Donald R. Newcomb <dnewcomb@whale.st.usm.edu>
	  Support for Panasonic KX-1123 (KX-1123P?).
	  Take type epson. Added epson support in bin/apsfilter
	  Hope dvips X and Y coordinates 360x180 are in the correct
	  order ... I'll hear from you ;-) FAQ updated.

	* Lucas James <jj@ldjpc.apana.org.au>
	  rewindstdin fails for FreeBSD 2.X, because of the new
	  64 bit offsets. Added support for FreeBSD 2.X.

	* From: Thorsten Frigger <thorsten@elmos.elmos.de>
	  SunOS 4.1.X / Solaris 1.1.X - file(1) can't read from pipe
	  Added FreeBSD's sources of file command. Solaris sysadms
	  can now fiddle around with that version. But beware, you
	  are on your own ... Don't know if its suitable to replace
	  the originally file command completely ... be careful !!!

	* Steve Whorwood <steve@vertex.demon.co.uk>
	  Patch for a2ps.c. Slackware 2.0 with man 1.3 produces
	  other escape sequences for boldface, so a2ps fails
	  printing boldface correctly when printing manpages.
	  A fix for a2ps.c in the src tree provided ....

	* bumped version counter to 4.9 in different files

	* Updated FAQ

	* fixed Toms e-mail address in the file DONATIONS,
	  to keep him happy ;-)

Tue Nov  1 09:20:17 MET 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	Stefan Roehrich <sr@stefan.tricbbs.fn.sub.org>
	* changed typo in apsfilter, esc2 -> escp2.

Sun Oct  9 19:39:06 MET 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* changed mknew, not to include new and unfinished setupaps
	  stuff and RCS files for rel 481.

	* gs isn't a public domain product. Changed this in ANNOUNCE 
	  and WHO_AM_I. Hope I removed all occurrences.

	* rolled Rel. 481

Sun Oct  2 17:27:51 MET 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* Vince Skahan wanted landscape printing:
	  Added a new a2ps feature in apsfilter: 1l and 1ln
	  Allows you to print one page landscape with and without
	  header.
	  Changed the code around a2ps, basic (needed) a2ps opts,
	  that must be kept even if user overwrite the A2PS_OPTS
	  variable in their apsfilterrc files. Updated apsfilterrc file.

Sun Oct  2 13:39:22 MET 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* bcr@physics.purdue.edu (Bill C. Riemers) asks for more security, so:
	  Security enhancements to SETUP. Check if we are installed
	  in a directory, that is owned by root, daemon or bin.
	  Otherwise inform user, ask for permission to fix it,
	  show user waht will be done. Exit, if user isn't willed
	  to give us permissions ...
	  Only exception are our developement machines knobel and
	  hammer ... since we develope under our user accounts ... ;-)

Fri Sep 30 10:43:06 MET 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* Work on bug (7), try to give each printer his own spool dir.

Sun Sep 25 17:48:12 MET 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* changed mknew, so that GNU tar follows symbolic links

	* introduced a form to report bugs APS-BUG-FORM
	  added this info into INSTALL file

	* bumped version to 4.8, changed 4.8 to 48 in GLOBAL.sh
	  so that mknew produces aps-48.tgz, as announced !!!

Sun Sep 25 12:55:41 MET 1994 Andreas Klemm

	* removed the silly benchmark from SETUP

	* a2ps manpage will be installed if certain fix
	  man-dirs are found.

	* added option -nL for a2ps to suppress the user Login ID
	  as well when printing pages with no borders
	  (FEATURE 1n and 2n)

	* updated documentation / installation

	* introduced a TROUBLESHOOTING file, debugging hints ...

	* changed the name of the variable DEBUG_TO_FILE 
	  to PRINT_TO_FILE to make more clear, that print data
	  will be put into this file.
	  Real debugging output will be found in the file
	  PRINTER_SPOOLDIR/log as before !

	* disabled debugging in the filter for the final 
	  _release_ version 4.8

	* added LOCAL_PATH in global/GLOBAL.sh, to be in sync with
	  TROUBLSHOOTING docu, how to add more local search paths
	  to needed programs.

	* updated docu a bit. renamed some files, added some files
	  to be more clear.

Sat Sep 17 20:27:36 1994  Thomas Bueschgens  (sledge@hammer.oche.de)

	* Added PROBLEMS file so people know what to do in case of
	  trouble, whom to send mail to and so on!

	* Let RCS take over the revision/release-numbers to avoid those
	  4.01Beta-names!! Two number should be sufficient, right?

	* README: added pointer where to get pbmplus & jpeg-stuff if
	  someone needs to add this stuff to his machine to print
	  pictures.

	* setup/filtersetup: added support for djpeg needed for printing
	  JPEG-Pictures. Introduces HAVE_DJPEG for  apsfilter
	  automatically.

	* bin/apsfilter.tom: added support for JPEG-pictures for both,
	  color and mono-printer. Due to that new Variable DJPEG_OPTS
	  which is set depending on color/mono-printer.

Wed Aug 31 21:28:20 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* rolled new version 403 Beta

Wed Aug 31 21:23:36 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* bug in SETUP, filtersetup run very early and don't find
	  a2ps and rewindstdin, filtersetup wasn't repeated later,
	  when a2ps and rewindstdin are compiled and installed ...

	* since we compile in background, we wait for that ...

	* introduced fun stuff ... do you have humour ?! ;-)

Sat Aug 27 18:38:48 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* bumped version count to 4.02 (Beta) to avoid confusion

Sat Aug 27 18:29:55 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* introduced global apsfilterrc file /etc/apsfilterrc
	  Therefore changed SETUP again.

	* read apsfilterrc now erlier in apsfilter, not in the case
	  structure or functions ... Perhaps a bit overhead, but
	  shorter and better

	* read global apsfilterrc first, so that there are sane
	  defaults, and then - if present - the users one ...
	  so the user gets his customization but if he has an
	  old template I keep apsfilter happy for the case, it
	  contains needed stuff for runtime.

Sat Aug 27 16:52:17 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* bumped version to 401B (Beta) to avoid confusion when
	  speaking about the new release ... ;-)

Sat Aug 27 15:23:33 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* Better documentation of template/apsfilterrc

	* new compile/install utility setup/compile

	* Enhanced the SETUP script in many ways ...
		- script calls setup/compile
		  to automatically compile and install
		  a2ps and rewindstdin.
		- additional remarks concerning user setup
		  (apsfilterrc) and remote printing...

Sat Aug 27 13:17:23 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.gun.de>

	* My e-mail address changed ! ;-) Please note this ;-)

	* Changed mknew to create smaller uuencoded Beta versions
	  If a apsfilter Release contains the letters {a,A,B,b}
	  ( -> see GLOBAL.sh ) then this smaller archive is created
	  without doc and testfiles.

	* End of SETUP utility tells you now what to do next:
	  compile and install a2ps and rewindstdin.

Wed Aug 24 18:22:18 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.kirsch.de>

	* Some more installation instructions for a2ps and rewindstdin
	  in the README file.

Wed Aug 24 17:56:43 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.kirsch.de>

	* changed apsfilter's fault_filetype function to be smarter
	  and nicer. Better formatted output and tells user now
	  about "unsupported" filetypes ... and that he might solve this
	  by typing lpr -Pascii or lpr -Praw.
	  Since it might be possible that he tried to print ascii files
	  containing control characters or such ... who knows what file(1)
	  reports ...

	* fixed bug in SETUP, it didn't ask properly for BAUDRATE when
	  installing a serial printer. Asked for Device twice, removed
	  one question ;-)

	* bj10e doesn't have 360dpi, changed it to 300dpi, hope that's
	  correct now.

Wed Aug 24 16:28:13 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.kirsch.de>

	* Rolled the version 4.0-Beta

	* Changed global/GLOBAL.sh to version 4.0

	* Merged older changelog files into this one (beginning from 
	  apsfilter 1.3 !!!) 

	* added Q 1.4 "Printing of long ascii listings 
		(C-Source,...) is dog slow..."
	  to FAQ

	* added Q 1.5 "how to manage strange search paths for programs..."
	  to FAQ

	* FAQ Q 1.1, ypu have to run filtersetup, not mksymlinks,
	  to add new filters to the apsfilter program.

	* created a KNOWN_BUGS file - a todo file ...

Wed Aug 24 16:15:32 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.kirsch.de>

	* removed doc/INSTALL since its meaningless ;-)
	  It explains to you how to extract the gnu zipped tar archive
	  aps-XXX.tgz. But to get that file/information you have to extract
	  the archive first ...  you get the clue ?! ;-)

Wed Aug 24 15:22:34 MET DST 1994  Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.kirsch.de>

	* Updated README and WHO_AM_I to reflect the latest changes

	* Changed the name WHO_AM_I to WHAT_AM_I to reflect the
	  purpose of this file better.

	* removed README_QUICK_INSTALL since it didn't contain
	  valuable stuff and README is already smart to the user ;-)

	* Created a file MANIFEST which is a list of all files
	  that belong to apsfilter with a short description for
	  what purpose they are. Removed that stuff from README.

	* Added more information into README, which documents to
	  read next.

	* Changed README to tell the user to install the template
	  file apsfilterrc into his home directory.

	* introduced the file FAQ in apsfilters top level directory.

	* put only apsfilter under RCS revision control
	  starting at apsfilter 4.1

	* stripped apsfilter a bit more, moved changelog and
	  thanks to contributors into this file

Wed Aug 24 15:02:09 MET DST 1994 Andreas Klemm <andreas@knobel.knirsch.de>

	* After Thomas had his `creative time' the version is again
	  owned by me ;-) This means testing and writing docu ;-)
	  Thanks Tom for your valuable work when I had no time
	  to change the things in the filter !

	* Changed Makefiles of src/a2ps-4.2-akl-new and src/rewind-stdin.
	  Introduced the shellscripts install_it. These scripts are looking
	  in /etc/printcap, where apsfilter is really installed, to place
	  the binaries of a2ps and rewindstdin exactly in
	  $APS_BASEDIR/bin, which is on top of the search path in apsfilter.
	  This makes sure, that the enhanced a2ps will be used instead of
	  older ones. Same for other tools needed for apsfilter.

	* The install_it scripts checks and makes sure, that apsfilter
	  has to be installed first before attempting to install
	  a2ps and rewindstdin.

Thu Aug 11 14:23:15 1994  Thomas Bueschgens  (sledge@hammer.oche.de)

	* setup/mksymlinks: create necessary symlinks if color printers
	  are choosen.

	* SETUP: added support for color-printers so the correct entries
	  for /etc/printcap are computed.
	  
	  remove FEATURE from setup, this is user-configurable by now from
	  .apsfilterrc

Wed Aug 10 10:06:53 1994  Thomas Bueschgens  (sledge@hammer.oche.de)

	* bin/apsfilter.tom: added PNMTOPS-variable to control wether
	  color or mono-pics are created.
	  
	  recompute HAVE_PNMTOPS to depend on HAVE_PPMTOPGM if mono is
	  used to ensure correct error-messages if pbm-utils are installed
	  incomplete.

	* setup/filtersetup: added ppmtopgm to the list of
	  needed/supportet filters so color-data may be converted to
	  mono-data.

	* bin/apsfilter.tom: moved A2PS_MARGIN-definition to print_ascii()
	  so it is only defined if necessary.

Tue Aug  9 16:36:59 1994  Thomas Bueschgens  (sledge@hammer.oche.de)

	* bin/apsfilter.tom: changed 'echo $0' to 'basename $0' sp
	  paths with '-' are recognized correctly, too. 

Mon Aug  1 09:09:05 1994  Thomas Bueschgens  (sledge@hammer.oche.de)

	* SETUP: removed the choice wether to modify /etc/magic or not
	  since this caused errors on many systems
	  Corrected some typos

	* template/: changed the README and added a warning that
	  double-entries in /etc/magic may cause malfunctions of apsfilter

	* global/GLOBAL.sh: changed one path to reflect my systems
	  tex-installation

	* doc/: changed the documentation a bit to keep track with the
	  newest changes

	* SETUP: read BAUD if installing a serial-printer, don't write
	  APS_BASEDIR to /etc/printcap if addinga printer

	* template/apsfilterrc: added the HAVE_MAKETEXPK and
	  FEATURE-templates to the example-apsfilterrc

	* bin/apsfilter.tom: clean up documention in apsfilter, changed
	  a2ps-options, added HAVE_MAKETEXPK-flag
	  
	  moved FEATURE-recognition from apsfilters name to users config
	  file .apfilterrc, prepared use of color-property

	  added support for compacted ASCII-files if ascii-filetype was
	  forced

================================================================================
changes 3.0.1 -> 3.0.2
================================================================================

 [ some fixes from Bob Trush <rd@tarpit.oau.org> ], thanks !
 - corrected typo in README, README_QUICK_INSTALL and setup
 - added support for HP Laserjet 4l "ljet4l"
 - support for BSD/386 from BSDI
 - new variable MAGIC defines where the magic(5) file can be found
 - grabs HOME_DIR more precisely using grep "^$LOGINNAME:" ....
 - more precise and effective usage of the shells eval command
   for eval $PRINT_PS ...
 - added/changed PATH in GLOBAL.sh
 - added HAVE_MAKETEXPK to decide wether to create fonts while
   print_dvi or not
 
================================================================================
changes 3.0 -> 3.0.1 (AKL)
================================================================================

 - changed $APS_BASEDIR/bin/GLOBAL.sh to $APS_BASEDIR/global/GLOBAL.sh
 - lowercase the output of the file(1) command to be more portable
   rewritten the queries in the case structure

================================================================================
changes 2.3 -> 3.0 (AKL)
================================================================================

 - removed reverse print order for nec printers
 - added -M option not to call MakeTeXPK to create missing fonts
   when printing with dvips because of a bug in the script that causes
   an exit of apsfilter and not printing anything.
 - ascii->a2ps: added missing -1 option when printing in portrait.
 - HOME_DIR is users homedir. Here we look for ps files that might
   be included when printing dvi files with dvips using the feature,
   to include Postscript pictures produced by xfig or other programs...
 - introduced a .apsfilter config file in each users home directory
   allows the user to add printer specific initialization when printing
   raw ascii text 
	var. PRINT_RAW_SETUP_PRINTER allows to set special init commands
	var. PRINT_RAW_SUPPRESS_FORMFEED suppresses formfeed after print_raw
 - modifications for EPSON STYLUS (gs' printer type esc2 wasn't managed
   by the filter.
 - added support for esc2 printers ;-) I forgot them uiiii ;)
 - removed $ECHO which represented an echo command that can handle
   control characters \xxx since printf is used for that ...
 - introduced user custom print and feature commands in some
   print functions ... print_dvi, print_raw, print_ps ....
   user defineable via $HOME/.apsfilterrc file
 - removed Preserving of TMP_FILE since we don't have any ...
 - added a global setup file bin/apsfilterrc that is created during 
   installation by bin/filtersetup. It contains env. variables that tell
   us, which filter programs are available or not (gs, dvips, a2ps,...)
   If you add a filter, then you have to edit filtersetup and rerun it.
   In apsfilter you should ask then, if a special filter is available
   before trying to call it .... 
 - added sun rasterfile support
 - read PATH from GLOBAL.sh
 - removed all occurrences of TMP_DIR, since not necessary anymore
 - added /usr/openwin/bin to searchpath for Sun's Solaris 1 to
   find ras2ps....
 - added filter support for gif and fig
 - print sunraster using Poskanzer bitmap utilities, if ras2ps isn't there
 - can print compressed files compressed by: compress, gzip, pack, freeze
   one exception, doesn't work on compressed dvi files (dvips -> gs)
 - and certainly some more .... ;-)

# A last minute hack caused file type autorecognition to fail :-(
# The culprit: I only appended $PATH to the search path for machine 
# specific search paths. And boom :-(
# After removing $PATH from the PATH= line everything works perfectly now.
# Oh folks .. the next time I don't include wishes from people without 
# testing, even if the changes are soooo minimal as in this case '-)
#
# No line in this script exceeds 80 columns any more,
# as suggested by Stephen Hsieh <sch2@crux5.cit.cornell.edu>
#
# Modified the way how apsfilters command line arguments are stored
# in environment variables, 
# as suggested by Dirk Sturzebecher <dirk@flop.escape.de>

#
# introduced shell functions print_ps, print_dvi, print_ascii, ....
# is needed for the new program functions to force printing of ascii, which
# is needed for printing "deutsche Umlaute"
#
# problems with "deutschen Umlauten"
# Text containing "Deutsche Umlaute" may be interpreted as data, so cr/nl 
# conversion for deskjet and possibly other printer doesn't work.
# A possible solution is to force the script to handle imput data as text or
# something else.
#
# exit 1 on print fault caused lpd to print the file again and again
# and lots of tmp files made TMP_DIR full.. so we have to exit 0 in any case
#
# Introduced MAILX variable. /bin/mail = elm on Linux. Elm didn't find
# ~/Mail directory, so it failed to send $NOTIFY a mail when a print error
# occurred.
#
# David Frey <dfrey@stud.ee.ethz.ch>:
# use lpr's command line arguments -wwidth -iindent -llength, pipe ascii
# through pr
#
# and some more ...

Major changes since apsfilter-1.3:
---------------------------------
o I changed the copyright to the GPL, since in my first public 
  version it was to rigid. My fault .. but now everything is ok !

o Main feature in this version is a total rewrite of the configuration
  section that makes printer specific modifications very simple !
