This directory contains a template file ``apsfilterrc'' that every 
user _may_ (not have to) place into his home - directory to fiddle 
around with some options ...

Simply copy apsfilterrc to $HOME/.apsfilterrc

	$ cp apsfilterrc $HOME/.apsfilterrc

Edit $HOME/.apsfilterrc to change apsfilters behaviour. Read the 
comments in this user-customizeable setup file.

The etc.magic.* files contain rules for the file(1) command
to detect the type of files.

If apsfilter complains about unknown-filetype, be sure to check out
your /etc/magic wether they contain pieces for the supported
filestypes.

If your /etc/magic is a bit outdated just add the missing part!

WARNING!!

be sure that you have no double-entries in your /etc/magic, since this
would prevent apsfilter from printing properly.
