Directory lout/doc/expert

This directory contains the Lout source files
for the Expert's Guide to the Lout Document
Formatting System.  To produce the Guide, type
the command

	lout all > outfile.ps

in this directory.  This must be done four times
to completely resolve all cross references (five
times if Letter page size is used), although the
PostScript file outfile.ps is printable after
the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.  A
copy of the final outfile.ps is included.  There
should be no warning messages on the fourth run.
