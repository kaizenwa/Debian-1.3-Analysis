@Begin
@PP
A footnote is created by typing
footnote. @Index @Code "@FootNote"
@ID @Code "@FootNote { Like this. }"
after the word that the footnote refers to.  It will be numbered
automatically and placed at the foot of the page or column;
@FootNote { Like this. }
or, if space there is insufficient, it may start on or run onto the
following page or column.  The footnote must be enclosed in braces.
@PP
The @Code "@FootNote" symbol has a @Code "@Location" option which
determines where it goes:
@ID @Code {
"@FootNote"
"    @Location { ColFoot }"
"{ ... }"
}
places the footnote at the bottom of the column, and
@ID @Code {
"@FootNote"
"    @Location { PageFoot }"
"{ ... }"
}
places it at the bottom of the current page, occupying the full page
width even in a multi-column document (this is occasionally
useful for footnotes to headings).  Of course, in a single-column
document there is no difference anyway.  The default value of the
@Code "@Location" option is {@Code "ColFoot"}.
@PP
Endnotes work in exactly the same way as footnotes, except that the
endnote. @Index @Code "@EndNote"
symbol to use is @Code "@EndNote" and they appear either at the end
of the document or at the end of some major part of it, depending on
the type of document (Chapter {@NumberOf types}).  Endnotes are
always column width and so have no @Code "@Location" option.
@PP
The language of a footnote or endnote will be the language of the
document as a whole.  This is not necessarily the same as the
current language at the point where the footnote or endnote occurs,
or even the language of the enclosing large-scale structure symbol.  It
may be necessary to enclose the body of the footnote in a language
symbol, like this:
@ID @Code "@FootNote { French @Language { ... } }"
Doing it the other way ({@Code "French @Language @FootNote ..."}) is
not effective.
@PP
A footnote attached to the very last line of a chapter or appendix of
a book occasionally runs onto the first page of the following chapter
or appendix, and this looks very poor.  If this happens, the solution
is to place an @Code "@LP" after the last line (including the footnote).
@PP
The setup file contains a number of options for controlling the
appearance of footnotes.  (See Section @NumberOf setup for a general
introduction to setup files and their options.)  Here are all the
options, with their default values:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@FootNoteThrough { No }"
"@FootNoteLocation { ColFoot }"
"@FootNoteNumbers { Arabic }"
"@FootNoteFont { 0.80f }"
"@FootNoteBreak { 1.20fx }"
"@FootLen { 2.00c }"
"@FootAboveGap { 1.00v }"
"@FootGap { 0.20c }"
}
There are also setup file options for controlling endnotes.  Since
they are quite similar to the ones for footnotes, we won't say any
more about them here.
@PP
@Code "@FootNoteThrough" may be @Code "Yes" or @Code { "No" };
footnotethrough. @Index @Code "@FootNoteThrough"
@Code "Yes" means that the footnotes are numbered continuously
through the document (or through each chapter in the case of books);
@Code "No" means that the numbering begins afresh on each
page.  @Code "@FootNoteLocation" determines the default value of
footnotelocatin. @Index @Code "@FootNoteLocation"
the @Code "@Location" option mentioned above; it may be either
@Code "ColFoot" or {@Code "ColPage"}.  @Code "@FootNoteNumbers"
determines how the footnotes are numbered;
footnotenumbers. @Index @Code "@FootNoteNumbers"
it may be {@Code Arabic}, {@Code Roman}, {@Code UCRoman}, {@Code Alpha},
or {@Code UCAlpha}.
@PP
@Code "@FootNoteFont" and @Code "@FootNoteBreak" determine the
footnotefont. @Index @Code "@FootNoteFont"
footnotebreak. @Index @Code "@FootNoteBreak"
font and paragraph breaking style of footnotes.  The default value
of @Code "@FootNoteFont" produces the same font family and face as the
bulk of the document, but reduced to 0.8 times the original size.
@PP
@Code "@FootLen" determines the length of the small horizontal line
footlen. @Index @Code "@FootLen"
drawn above the footnotes; 
@Code "@FootAboveGap" determines the minimum space to be left clear
footabovegap. @Index @Code "@FootAboveGap"
above this line; and @Code "@FootGap" determines the
footgap. @Index @Code "@FootGap"
vertical separation between footnotes.  All three may be any length.
