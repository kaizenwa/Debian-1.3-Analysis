Directory lout/doc/user

This directory contains the Lout source files for the User's Guide
to the Lout Document Formatting System.  To produce the Guide,
type the command

	lout all > op

in this directory.  This must be done five times to completely
resolve all cross references, although the PostScript file op is
printable after the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.

The first run will produce a large number of error messages,
nearly all beginning with "unresolved cross reference".  These
should gradually go away on later runs.  The following shows the
error message output on the fifth run for Letter size printing:

lout file "gra_summ" (from "gra" line 44, from "all.letter" line 37):
     8,1: 23.0c object too high for 21.8c space; @Scale inserted
lout file "cpp_tabs" (from "cpp" line 24, from "all.letter" line 38):
   53,23: c2lout: C text ended inside a comment
   55,35: c2lout: C text ended inside a comment
lout file "ap_qck" (from "all.letter" line 40):
  155,25: 22.6c object too high for 21.8c space; @Scale inserted

The first and last point to two places where there are unbreakable
displays which are slightly too large to fit on one page and so
have been vertically scaled to fit.  These displays fit on an A4
page hence these messages do not appear when using A4 size.  The
other two warnings point to two places where a C program text ended
inside a comment, which in these cases was deliberate so is no problem.

A copy of the final PostScript output file (A4 paper size) is
stored at "ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/jeff/lout/lout.3.08.user.ps.gz".
