When part of a document is written in a language other than English,
languages. @Index { languages other than English }
Lout should be informed of this using the @Code "@Language" symbol:
language. @Index @Code "@Language"
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"... the garter, he said:  French @Language { `Honi soit qui mal y"
"pense' }, and this saying ..."
}
Changing language is quite analogous to changing font using the
@Code "@Font" symbol.
@PP
Since accented characters (Section {@NumberOf characters}) are always
available irrespective of the language, at first sight it might seem
that there is no need to bother informing Lout what language you are
writing in.  However, words are hyphenated differently depending on the
hyphenation.languages @SubIndex { in languages other than English }
language, and some symbols have different results in different
languages.  For example,
@ID @Code "Danish @Language @Date"
produces
@ID { Danish @Language @Date }
date.languages @SubIndex { in languages other than English }
time.languages @SubIndex { in languages other than English }
lists.languages @SubIndex { in languages other than English }
and the alphabetic list symbols of Section {@NumberOf lists} also
vary with the current language.  So it's worth doing for the sake of
knowing that non-English parts will appear as they should.
@PP
At the time of writing, the following languages were available as
part of the standard distribution of Lout:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
Czech Cesky Cestina
Danish Dansk
Dutch Nederlands
English
Finnish Suomi
French Francais Fran{@Char ccedilla}ais
German Deutsch
Norwegian Norsk
Polish Polski
Russian
Slovenian Slovenia Slovenija
Spanish Espa{@Char ntilde}ol
Swedish Svenska
}
As shown, most languages have alternative names, all equally acceptable
to the @Code "@Language" symbol.
@PP
If your entire document is in a language other than English, you need
to change the @Code "@InitialLanguage" option:
initiallanguage. @Index @Code "@InitialLanguage"
@ID @Code "@InitialLanguage { Deutsch }"
If you are using your own setup file (Section {@NumberOf setup}), you
can change it there.  If not, you can change it at the start of your
document, as explained in Section {@NumberOf ordinary}.
@PP
Czech, Polish, and Slovenian use the ISO-LATIN-2 character set, and
Russian uses Cyrillic characters.  Consult directory @Code "software"
in the Lout distribution to find out how to get the extra things you
need for these languages.  Other left-to-right languages are easily
added, so please consult the author if your language is not listed.
