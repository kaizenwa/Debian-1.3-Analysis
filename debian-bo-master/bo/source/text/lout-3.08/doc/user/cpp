This chapter describes how to typeset C and C++ program text using the
cp. @Index @Code "@CP"
c. @Index { C++ }
@Code "@CP" symbol in conjunction with the @Code c2lout filter.  The
@Code "@CP" symbol looks after printing keywords in bold, variables
in italic, and so on, depending on a style you choose.  It does not lay
out programs in the sense of choosing indenting, it preserves the layout
you give to the program.  From now on, `C' means `C or C++' wherever
it occurs.
@PP
It is possible to simply print out one or more C files; we call this
@I { stand-alone mode }.  Alternatively, the C program text may be printed
as part of a larger Lout document; we call this @I { embedded mode }.
