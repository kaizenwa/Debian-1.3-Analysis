In conclusion, here is the input for a relatively large table:

The most interesting things about it are the use of outdented paragraphs,
and the @Code "@Wide" symbol which restricts the width of the second column,
which would otherwise be as wide as the first and last.  Here is the result:
@LeftDisplay 10p @Font 1.15fx @Break @Tab
    linewidth { 1.0p }
    vmargin { 0.4v }
    @Fmta { @Col @B A ! @Col @B B ! @Col @B C ! @Col @B D }
    @Fmtb { @Col outdent @Break A ! @Col 1.8c @Wide ragged @Break B !
            @Col C ! @Col outdent @Break D }
{
@Rowa above { single } below { single }
    A { Scholarship }
    B { Value $ }
    C { Closing date }
    D { Qualifications }

@Rowa
    A { 1.  Tenable at the University of Sydney }

@Rowb
    A { Commonwealth and University Postgraduate Research Awards }
    B { 10,415 (12,724 to 16,433 from 1 January 1990) }
    C { 31 October }
    D { Graduates with Hons I or Hons II Div. 1.  For research in any field }
