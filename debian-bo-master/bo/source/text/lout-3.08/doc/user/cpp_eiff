There is an @Code "@Eiffel" symbol for typesetting Eiffel programs
in conjuction with a filter called {@Code "eif2lout"}.  Apart from
the change of language, everything is identical to C printing.  The
file and symbol names are different, of course:
@ID @OneRow @Tab
    vmargin { 0.5vx }
    @Fmta { @Col A ! @Col B }
{
@Rowa
    A { {@Code cdoc}, {@Code creport}, etc. }
    B { {@Code edoc}, {@Code ereport}, etc. }
@Rowa
    A { @Code c2lout }
    B { @Code eif2lout }
@Rowa
    A { @Code "@CP" }
    B { @Code "@Eiffel" }
@Rowa
    A { @Code "@CPrint" }
    B { @Code "@EiffelPrint" }
}
but everything works in an exactly analogous way:  you place
@ID @Code "@SysInclude { edoc }"
at the top of your document, enclose Eiffel program texts in
@Code "@Eiffel { ... }", and so on.  The default style has been
changed to {@Code varying}, so as to conform to the style guidelines
in the standard Eiffel reference @Cite { $meyer1992eiffel }.  Some care
has gone into making this conformance strict; in particular, if you
enclose identifiers within comments in ` and ', as the style guidelines
say you should, they will come out in italics.
@PP
The files needed for Eiffel printing are distributed separately from
Basser Lout.  You can get them from the author's @Code ftp directory
(see the preface of this guide).
