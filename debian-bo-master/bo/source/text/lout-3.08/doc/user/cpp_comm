It is possible to embed Lout text inside C and C++ comments, by
starting off the comment with an @Code "@" character.  The entire
comment after the @Code "@" character should be Lout text.  For
example, to force Lout to start a new page at some point within a C
program, place
@ID @Code "/*@ @NP */"
at that point.  Or you could make a heading like this:
@ID @Code "/*@ @Display @Heading { treeprint() } */"
Other possible uses for this feature include index entries and margin
notes.  Incredible as it may seem, you can even write
@ID @Code "/*@ @CD @Heading { Function @CP { treeprint() } } */"
with a @Code "@CP" symbol and some C code inside the Lout code
inside the C code.  You probably can't go further, however, since
that would require a C comment inside a C comment.
