The @Code "@Verbatim" symbol prints the following object exactly as
it appears in the input file.  All special meanings for characters,
symbols, etc. are turned off; there is one result line for each
input line.  For example,
@ID @Code {
"@IndentedDisplay @Verbatim {"
"A line of \"verbatim\" text"
"Another line, with a \\ character"
"}"
}
has result
@IndentedDisplay lines @Break {
"A line of \"verbatim\" text"
"Another line, with a \\ character"
}
Use @Code "{ Courier Base } @Font @Verbatim { ... }" to get the result
in a fixed-width font.
@PP
If the verbatim text contains @Code "{" or @Code "}" characters, then
they should either be balanced or else you need to use the alternative
form
@ID @Code {
"@Verbatim @Begin"
"..."
"@End @Verbatim"
}
so that there is no doubt about where the verbatim text ends.
@PP
The @Code "@Verbatim" symbol relies on the @Code "sed" command, which
exists on Unix systems but not necessarily on others.  To ensure that
this manual can be formatted on any system, the result above was
simulated (i.e. not actually produced by the @Code "@Verbatim" symbol).
