The Lout definitions for the @Code "@Fig" symbol are kept in a file called
{@Code "fig"}, which you must include at the start of your document if
fig.file @Index { @Code "fig" file }
you want advanced graphics, like this:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@SysInclude { fig }"
"@SysInclude { doc }"
"@Doc @Text @Begin"
"..."
"@End @Text"
}
Files of definitions, like {@Code "fig"}, must be included before the
setup file.  Alternatively, if you are using your own setup file, you may
place the include commands within it; the place to put them is clearly
marked in all the standard setup files.
@PP
Throughout this chapter we will show the Lout text on the left and the
corresponding result on the right, like this:
@ID {
@Code {
"@Fig {"
"   @Square"
"   //0.5c"
"   @Circle"
"}"
}
||7ct
@Fig {
   @Square
   //0.5c
   @Circle
}
}
Subsequent examples will omit the enclosing {@Code "@Fig"}.
