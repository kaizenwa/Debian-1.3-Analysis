NAME
     c2lout - convert C and C++ source code into Lout

SYNOPSIS
     c2lout [ options ] C-files

DESCRIPTION
     Reformat C and C++ source code for input to the  Lout  docu-
     ment  formatting  system, taking care of comments, character
     strings, tab characters, etc.

     c2lout reads the named C and C++ files and  produces  output
     suitable for input to "lout -s".  Thus,

          c2lout myprog.c | lout -s | lpr

     will print myprog.c on a PostScript printer.  Each file will
     start on a new page, preceded by its name in bold.

OPTIONS
     -pfixed
          Use a fixed width font (the default).

     -pvarying
          Use a varying-width italic font  with  non-italic  bold
          keywords.

     -psymbol
          Use a varying-width italic font with mathematical  sym-
          bols and non-italic bold keywords.

     -n   Do not print the file name before each C or C++ file.

     -f<font>
          Select a font family.  The  default  is  -fCourier  for
          -pfixed, and -fTimes for -pvarying and -psymbol.

     -s<size>
          Select a Lout font size.  The default is -s9p  (meaning
          9  points)  for  -pfixed,  and  -s10p for -pvarying and
          -psymbol.  These work well with 80-character-wide  pro-
          grams.

     -v<vsize>
          Select a Lout vertical inter-line gap.  The default  is
          -v1.1fx  meaning  1.1 times the font size measured from
          baseline to baseline.

     -t<num>
          Set the tab interval to <num>  characters  (default  is
          -t8).

     -T<width>
          Without this option, c2lout simulates tabs with spaces.
          With this option, c2lout simulates tabs with Lout tabu-
          lation operators; <width>  is  the  width  of  one  tab
          interval  in  the  final print, measured in Lout units.
          This guarantees alignment of characters following  tabs
          even with varying-width fonts, provided <width> is suf-
          ficiently large.  For example,  -T0.5i  produces  half-
          inch tab intervals.

     -u   Print usage information on stderr.

     -V   Print version information on stderr.

RAW MODE
     There is a "raw mode" usage of c2lout invoked by a -r  flag.
     This  converts  one C file into Lout-readable source without
     any heading or trailing information.  Synopsis:

         c2lout -r  -i<infile>  -o<outfile>  -e<errfile>  -t<num>
     -T<width>

     Users should never need this mode; it is  invoked  automati-
     cally  from  within  Lout  by the @CP symbol from the cprint
     package (see reference).
