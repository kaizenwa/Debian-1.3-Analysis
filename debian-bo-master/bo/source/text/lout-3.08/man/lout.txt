LOUT(1)                   User Commands                   LOUT(1)



NAME
     lout - prepare Lout document for printing

SYNOPSIS
     lout [ -s ] files

DESCRIPTION
     Invoke the Basser Lout interpreter on the  concatenation  of
     the  named  files,  producing  a PostScript file on standard
     output suitable for printing on  PostScript  printers  using
     lpr(1).   If no files are named, stdin is used instead.  The
     special file name - may be used to  denote  standard  input.
     There  may  be  white  space between flags like -i and their
     associated <filename> or <dirname> values.

     An optional .lt suffix may  be  used  for  Lout  source  and
     include  files.   When  invoking files ending in this suffix
     the suffix may be omitted.

OPTIONS
     -s              Suppress all  reading  and  writing  of  the
                     cross  reference  database;  other databases
                     are not affected.  Useful when  many  simple
                     documents  that don't do any cross referenc-
                     ing are stored in one directory.

     -EPS            Produce output in the form of an EPS (Encap-
                     sulated   PostScript)   file,  suitable  for
                     inclusion in another document.

     -p              Produce  plain  text   output   instead   of
                     PostScript.

     -P              Like  -p  but  with  a  form-feed  character
                     between pages.

     -S              Safe execution:  disable all calls  to  sys-
                     tem(3),  instead  echoing  the commands that
                     would have been executed.

     -e<filename>    Direct error messages to <filename>  instead
                     of to stderr.

     -o<filename>    Direct  PostScript  output   to   <filename>
                     instead of to stdout.

     -i<filename>    Search the directories of the  include  file
                     path   (see   below)   for   <filename>   or
                     <filename>.lt and include it.  There may  be
                     multiple -i options.

     -I<dirname>     Add <dirname> to  the  list  of  directories
                     searched  for  @Include  files and -i option
                     files.  There may be  multiple  -I  options.
                     @Include  first  searches the current direc-
                     tory, then searches the  -I  directories  in
                     the  order  given,  and finally searches the
                     default include file directory (see  below).
                     @SysInclude  and  the  -i  option  omit  the
                     search of the current directory.

     -C<dirname>     Add <dirname> to  the  list  of  directories
                     searched  for  Lout character mapping (.LCM)
                     files.  There may be  multiple  -C  options;
                     the  directories  are  searched in the order
                     given, and  finally  the  default  character
                     mappings directory is searched (see below).

     -F<dirname>     Add <dirname> to  the  list  of  directories
                     searched  for  font  metrics (formerly .AFM)
                     files.  There may be  multiple  -F  options;
                     the  directories  are  searched in the order
                     given, and finally the default font  metrics
                     directory is searched (see below).

     -H<dirname>     Add <dirname> to  the  list  of  directories
                     searched  for  hyphenation  patterns  files,
                     both unpacked (.lh) and packed (.lp).  There
                     may  be multiple -H options; the directories
                     are searched in the order given, and finally
                     the   default   hyphenation   directory   is
                     searched (see below).

     -D<dirname>     Add <dirname> to  the  list  of  directories
                     searched for Lout database files.  There may
                     be multiple -D options.  @Database  searches
                     the  current  directory,  then the -D direc-
                     tories  in  the  order  given,  and  finally
                     searches  the  default  databases  directory
                     (see below).  @SysDatabase omits the  search
                     of the current directory.

     --<opt>{<val>}  Set setup file <opt>  to  <val>,  overriding
                     any  value  assigned  to  <opt> in the setup
                     file.  For example, --@PageType{Letter} will
                     set  the  @PageType  setup  file  option  to
                     Letter.  The value  may  be  a  sequence  of
                     words  but not an arbitrary Lout object.  If
                     there are spaces you must ensure that it  is
                     passed to Lout as a single option; the usual
                     way to do this is to enclose it in quotes.

     -x              Initializing run, not for ordinary use: read
                     and  check  all font files mentioned in font
                     definitions, read and check all  hyphenation
                     files  mentioned in language definitions and
                     build compressed versions,  read  and  check
                     all  database  files  mentioned  in database
                     clauses and build index files.

     -u              Print usage information on stderr.

     -V              Print version information on stderr.
