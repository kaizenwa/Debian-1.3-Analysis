This set of data and program files implements a French dictionary to
be used with the ispell program, version 3.1.04 and following.  The
dictionary contains roughly 50,000 roots, which expand to about
220,000 words.  Since I don't see why a person who doesn't understand
French would need a French spelling checker, the rest of the
description and installation instructions are in French, in the file
"LISEZMOI".
