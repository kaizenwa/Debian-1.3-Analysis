I am please to announce version 1.0 of the GNU miscellaneous files
distribution.

This distribution includes files not of crucial importance for system
administration or operation, but which have come to be common on
various systems over the years.

All the files in version 1.0 have come from BSD, but files from other
sources are eagerly solicited.  If you have any suggestions about
files to add to this distribution, or corrections to the files here,
please send them to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

Please send all bug reports by electronic mail to:
    bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu

These files are all freely redistributable.
