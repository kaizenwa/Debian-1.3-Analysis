GNU `ptx' is the GNU version of the traditional permuted index
generator.  It can handle multiple input files at once, produce TeX
compatible output, and produce readable "KWIC" (KeyWords In Context)
indexes without needing to use `nroff'.  This version does not handle
input files that do not fit in memory all at once.

GNU `ptx' has been written by Franc,ois Pinard.  It is an evolving
product, and specifications might change in future releases.

This is a beta release.  This version is able to handle small
files quickly, while providing a platform for more development.
However, development priority is low.  An overall renaming of all
options is foreseeable.

The command syntax is not the same as traditional `ptx': all given
files are input files, the results are produced on standard output by
default.
