This is a fix to mpage that makes it work with ArborText called "mfix".

To compile it just type: 

cc mfix.c -o mfix

To use this as a fix to mpage, just pipe the mpage output through stdin and it will
send the corrected output to stdio.. 

For example, try it on the file "test.ps", by typing :

mpage -2 -P test.ps | mfix | lpr

and the file should be sent to the printer..

Note: This program might mess up if you aren't using Arbortext.. So if it doesn't print
out correctly check the source..


Any bugs or problems contact.
