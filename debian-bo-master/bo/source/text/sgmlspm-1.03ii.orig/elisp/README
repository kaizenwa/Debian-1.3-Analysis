This directory contains sgmls.el, a LISP front-end for the SGMLS
parser and any associated post-processors.  By default, it is set up
to use James Clark's sgmls with the sgmlsasp post-processor, but you
can reconfigure it for use with sgmlspl by adding the following code
to your ~/.emacs file:

  (setq-default sgmls-postprocessor "sgmlspl")

You can also choose a central directory for your sgmlspl scripts, as
in the following example:

  (setq-default sgmls-spec-directory "~/lib/perl5")

There are many, many more options -- read the comments at the top of
the file for details.
