Thu Aug 24 10:14:09 1995  David Megginson <david@baeda.english.uottawa.ca>

	* tolatex.pl and tohtml.pl: added support for wacky SYSID
        modifications to NSGMLS.

	* Makefile (clean): added $(SGMLSPL) variable, so that users can
	specify a location for sgmlspl not in their paths (suggested by
	Rick Wong, rwong@jessica.stanford.edu).

* VERSION 1.01

Sat Aug 12 09:58:17 1995  David Megginson  <david@baeda.english.uottawa.ca>

	* tohtml.pl: changed entity handler to deal with funky sysids
	from NSGMLS (this needs more work).

	* Makefile (SGMLDECL): changed to
	/usr/local/lib/sgml/sgmldecl/docbook.dcl to reflect changes in my
	local system (your mileage may vary).
	(clean): now _really_ cleans up.
	(html): if the refs.pl file does not exist in the relevant
	directory, make the HTML files _twice_.

	* sgmlspl.sgml: fixed some typos with the function name sgmls()
	instead of sgml() (reported by Rick Wong
	<rwong@jessica.stanford.edu>).

	* sgmlspm.sgml: fixed the captions on tables 1 and 2 (reported by
        Rick Wong <rwong@jessica.stanford.edu>).
