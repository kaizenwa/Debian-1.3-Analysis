This set of data files implements a Spanish (castellano) dictionary to
be used with the international ispell program, version 3.1.13 or
further. The dictionary contains 51,000 roots (aprox.).

If you want to run the spanish dictionary, you have to undefine the
NO8BIT macro in the local.h configuration file.

Contents:

	The distribution is included in the espa~nol.tar.gz file.
To extract sources that are in files ending in `.tar.gz' you can use the command

      gzip -d < espa~nol.tar.gz | tar xf -

where `espa~nol.tar.gz' is the name of the file.

This file is expanded to the following files:

	espa~nol.aff: Affixes file.

	espa~nol.words: Contains a list of words that appear in the
official espa~nol dictionary (Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa'nola
de la Lengua 21st edition).

	espa~nol.comp: Contains a list of words not appearing in the
official dictionary but being used in computer related texts.

	antiguas.words: Contains a list of words that appear in the
official espa~nol dictionary and they are old ones that are not
currently in use.

	espa~nol.words+: Contains the expanded list of words generated
	from the espa~nol.words and espa~nol.comp word files.

	e~nes: Script for replacing the 'n and 'N by ~n and ~N in the
espa~nol.aff, espa~nol.words and espa~nol.words+. If you use the
second way to specify this letter you have to run this script. This
script uses the sed utility. It has been checked by using the GNU sed
version 2.05. If you want to run this script make sure that you have the
GNU sed installed and type:

		make e~ne

	Makefile: Makefile for building the hash file
(espa~nol.hash) from the affix file and the espa~nol.words file.
This way of building the hash file needs about 50Mb of paging space and
100 Mb of temporary disk space. Please, ensure that you have
enough disk space in the tmp partition (usually /usr/tmp).
If you do not have it, you have to set the TMPDIR environment variable to
a path where you can allocate 100 Mb of temporary disk storage. If you
want to create the espa~nol.hash just type:
		make

	If you want to create the espa~nol.hash from the expanded word
	list (espa~nol.words+), just type:

		make build
	It does not need so much temporary space.

	Four different formatters are supported:

	Default formatter: The acute characters are coded as follows:

		'a	á
		'e	é
		'i	í
		'o	ó
		'u	ú
		'n	ñ
		"u	ü
		'A	Á
		'E	É
		'I	Í
		'O	Ó
		'U	Ú
		'N	Ñ
		"U	Ü
	TeX formatter: The acute characters are coded as follows:

		\'a	á
		\'e	é
		\'{\i}	í
		\'o	ó
		\'u	ú
		\'n	ñ
		\"u	ü
		\'A	Á
		\'E	É
		\'{\I}	Í
		\'O	Ó
		\'U	Ú
		\'N	Ñ
		\"U	Ü
	plainTeX formatter: The acute characters are coded as follows:

		\'{a}	á
		\'{e}	é
		\'{\i}	í

		\'{A}	Á
		\'{E}	É

		\'{U}	Ú
		\'{N}	Ñ
		\"{U}	Ü

	latin1 formatter: The acute characters are coded as specified
	in the iso_8859_1 code.

	If you want to run ispell by using one of the previous formats
	please type:

		ispell -T <formato> -d espa~nol <fichero>

	Note that the affixes list and the word list are under
development. We are currently working on them. If you find words
that does not appear in the word list or words that must not appear in
the word list, please send a message to espanol-bugs@datsi.fi.upm.es
