#{{{  Notes
.\" All literals should be written using a \fBbold\fP fonts, all
.\" variables using a \fIitalic\fP font.  Remember the following
.\" characters:
.\"
.\"  \e    backslash
.\"  \-    Minus
.\"  -     Hyphen
.\"  \(en  En-dash, typically used in things like "page 11\(en15"
.\"  \(em  Em-dash
.\"
.\" Don't use quotes in the usual text for god's sake, italic and bold 
.\" are better to read and you have to define strings for opening and 
.\" closing quotes to keep nroff and troff output nice.

#{{{  Description
.SH DESCRIPTION
long drawn out discussion of the program.  It's a good idea
to break this up into subsections using the .SS macros, like
.SS "Section Selection"
To seperate a paragraph, use 
.PP
Don't use .LP, it isn't part of all man macros.
.SS "Online Problem Reports"
There is no BUGS section, instead use
.IP "Bugs"
to document broken functions where they are described.
.PP
If you want to make references to other manual pages, use
.IR man (7)
or \fIman\fP(1).  Don't use .SH WARNINGS, warn people in the
description where the item to be warned about is described.
#}}}
#{{{  Options
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-option\fP
Some people make this separate from the description.
.IP "\fB\-option\fP \fIfile\fP"
You can also use .TP, but I like .IP much more.
