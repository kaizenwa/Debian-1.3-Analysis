&sdc; -- Sgml Document Compiler
<preface>

extensive way.

It is assembled from some subdocuments, which already share some text
parts. If you find something repeated -- you know why now.

Chapter <ref id=man// is simply the manual page of &sdc;.

For an short overview see the intro, which is Chapter <ref id=intro//
