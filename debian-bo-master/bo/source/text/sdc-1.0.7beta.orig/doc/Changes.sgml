<o>(22nd Okt 96) search <code/sgmls/ as <code/sdc-sgmls/ in
   the <code/bin/ subdirectories of the lib dir.

<o>(21st Sep 96) introduced path name flatening to protect NDATA
   entities stored in different subdirs of the DOCPATH from each
   other. The "/"'s get translated into "_"'s now. (see files.scm
   about meta characters.)

<o>(7th Juli 96) Version 1.0 cleaned the Hack in the DTD's to include
   subdoc entities. Now they should be wrapped with an
   <code/&lt;InclDiv>/.

<o>(26th June 96) arguments to rc files

<o>(19th June 96) Version 0.7: Introduced reparsing of the
document. Implementation based on streams and an recursive descendant
parser.

Because the old code is left in, some files are hardly clean and easy
to read.

<o><code/SUBDOC/ entities supported. You can include complete
documents within others and get them restructured as divisions of the
outer document.

<o>DTD's changed to use mixed content model. Not explicit 
<code/&lt;p>/ tags nessesary anymore.

<o><code/&lt;newpage/ supported within list items.

<o>Tgif supported as notation.

<o>Most (the computational intensive) notation handling based on
Makefiles.

<o><code/&lt;quote>/ element has got an <code/style/ attribute.

<o><code/-D/ option added. It adds a directory at front of the path
given by the environment variable <code/DOCPATH/.

<o>The <code/&amp;ltc;/ is not needed anymore. (But still allowed)

<o>(25th. Oct. 95)<code/SGML_PATH/ is no longer used (<bf/but
overwritten!/). The new name for the path pointing to the document
tree is <code/DOCPATH/. It is a simple colon separated path, pointing
to the directories to be searched for document entities.

<o>(25 Oct 95) Proposed tables work a little with Lout (they work as
long as there are no row/column spawning cells). Unforunatly the
implementation revealed limits of Lout. As there is obviously no way
to implement the full semantic without changes to Lout, and the latter
are not within reach.

<o>rc files added

<o>library is now a path
