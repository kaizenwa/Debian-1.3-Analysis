News for psptools 1.2
=====================

  - New names: the distribution is now called psptools, the printing
    tool is psplpr (which also implies that its environment variables
    have been renamed).

  - New tool: npslpr.

  - Better support for files that are not DSC conformant, by setting up
    a showpage replacement that sends code corresponding to features
    with an *OrderDependency of PageSetup. (As a side effect, this makes
    showpage call copypage then erasepage, which is not what Ghostscript
    does for example).

  - Better error messages.

  - Added environment variables for individual printers.

  - Support for parameters (used for example by CustomPageSize).

  - Support for getting the printer capabilities with nidump on machines
    having NetInfo.

  - Support for the inclusion of specific default values in the
    generated output.

  - Safer inclusion of PPD code if needed (recommended by the PPD 4.2
    document).

  - Addition of an error message when a parse error has been encountered
    in the PPD file, indicating the file and line of the error.

  - Addition of a ppd directory containing not widely available PPD
    files.

  - Fixed many typos, some of them causing bugs (in the handling of file
    inclusion, for example) :-(
