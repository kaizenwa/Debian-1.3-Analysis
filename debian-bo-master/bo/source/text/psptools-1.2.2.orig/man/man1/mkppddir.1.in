.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkppddir
creates or updates a file named
.B @ppd_dir@
in each
.I directory
containing PPD files (identified by a .ppd extension).
This file consists of lines mapping the PC file name to the Unix file
name for a given PPD file.
The exact format of a line is

.na
.nf
    \fIpcname\fP \fIfullname\fP \fIfilename\fP
.fi
.ad

where
.I pcname
is the name of the file as stored on a PC (in lowercase, without any
extension),
.I fullname
is the full name of the file (as it would normally be stored on a
system that is not a PC, in mixed case without extension) and
.I filename
is the actual name of the file on the system with its extension; the
.I filename
can contain spaces while the other names cannot.
.PP
The directory files created by
.B mkppddir
may be used by tools using PPD files to lookup specific files given
their PC or Unix name.
.PP
Note that
.B mkppddir
will delete empty
.B @ppd_dir@
files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version of
.B mkppddir
and exit.
.TP
.B \-f\fP,\fB \-\-force
Force the creation of a new
.B @ppd_dir@
rather than just updating it for files that are not listed in it
or have been created, deleted
or modified since the last modification of the directory file.
