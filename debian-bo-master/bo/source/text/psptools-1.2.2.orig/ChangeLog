	* src/mkppddir.pl.in: corrections
	Corrected misbehaviour of the --rename option.

	Better lookup for alternate names got from ppd.dir.

Thu Feb 24 12:46:09 1996  Yves Arrouye  <arrouye@marin.fdn.fr>

	* src/psplr.pl.in: default values selection
	Added the possibility to use DefaultSomething with the -u
	option, thus including code for the default setup of the
	Something feature.

	* man/man1/psplr.1.in: documented new features

Thu Feb 19 18:06:59 1996  Yves Arrouye  <arrouye@marin.fdn.fr>

	* (whole distribution): summary of changes
	Renamed the plpr tool to psplpr, and named the distribution
	psptools because psplpr will be accompanied by other tools.
	  Dispatched the various files to diverse directories, though
	there's still a single configure script and Makefile to manage the
	whole thing.
	  Added a ppd directory in which one can find PPD files for the
	Canon BJC printers (and Apple StyleWriter printers) and Aladdin
	Ghostscript, and a smart installation script.

	* src/ppd.pl.in: bug fixes and new features
	Fixed a bug in the inclusion of files.
	  Added the ability to redefine the showpage operator in order to
        (presumably) correctly do page setup with files that are not DSC
	conformants.
	  Added the parsing of query definitions (used by pspquery, of
	course...).

	* src/psplr.pl.in: new features
	Added the --lpr and --pr options. Note that pr is still untested
	as I do not have one :-(.
	
	* man/man1/psplpr.1.in: improved

Wed Nov 22 11:45:19 1995  Operator  <root@marin.sevy.fr>

	* Makefile.in: distribution
	Added this ChangeLog to the list of distributed files.
	  Removed the PACKAGE variable that is not used.
	  Removed the INSTALL file from files that are deleted by the
	maintainer-clean target.

	* configure.in: version
	Moved from version 1.0b to 1.1b to reflect changes.

	* plpr.pl.in: features handling
	Added recognition of keywords alternate names which are translated
	to their natural names after the PPD file has been parsed and
	before any other thing (like adding defaults for all options) is
	done by plpr(1).

	* ppd.pl.in: _parseppdfile()
	Enter alternate name from the *OpenUI keyword. The names mappings
	are stored in the %PPD_AltNames and %PPD_NatNames arrays.
	  Recognize keywords alternate names and replace them with their
        natural names if needed (this is not needed by plpr(1) but may be
	useful). Note that the code does not use alternate names for the
	options but just for the keywords.

	* plpr.1.in: options documentation
	Added documentation for the list optional keyword of the -z,
	--show option.
	  Changed the release date to 22 November, 1995.
	  Fixed miscellaneous typos.

	* plpr.pl.in: main part
	Implemented the list optional keyword for the -z, --show option,
	which lists features in a form that should be easy to parse by a
	separate tool.
