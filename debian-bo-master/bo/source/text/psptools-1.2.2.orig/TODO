What Do I Have to Do Next?
==========================

Next features for psptools 1.3 or above:

  - Handling of hexadecimal substrings in QuotedValues.

  - Inclusion of any resource (compatible with PSUtils' includeres and
    the organization of NEXTSTEP systems).

  - Automatic extraction of resources from files for later use by pspr
    (maybe not necessary because extractres from PSUtils does that).

  - Full emulation of pslpr's behaviour (in fact, just the resources
    inclusion---see above---and landscape printing, the LZW option
    being maybe a bad idea because of the patent on LZW).

  - Support for internalization on any platform.

Wished features:

  - C rewrite (if only I did not start this as a small Perl thing...).

  - Or at least a better (meaning just good) ppd.pl library.


Please email your wishes and enchnacements to me.
