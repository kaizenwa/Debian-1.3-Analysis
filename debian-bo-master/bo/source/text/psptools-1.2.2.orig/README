Psptools release 1.2.1
======================

Copyright (C) 1995, 1996 Yves Arrouye <Yves.Arrouye@marin.fdn.fr>
See the COPYRIGHT file in this distribution for more information.


Psptools is intended to comprise a set of tools to help one use the
capabilities of her PostScript printing devices (aka printers).
  This file is an introduction to the tools offered by psptools 1.2, a
free redistributable package.


The tools actually included in psptools are:

  - psplpr	a spooler frontend and filter for PostScript files

  - npslpr	a would-be clone of Adobe's pslpr, for command-line
		compatibility, just translating options and invoking
		psplpr to do the job (not all options of pslpr are
		actually supported)

  - mkppddir	create a specific directory listing of PPD files
		in a given directory for use by other tools

To make the psptools work, you will need:

  - perl5	Larry Wall's Perl language, version 5

You may also need:

  - psselect	too from Angus Duggan's PSUtils suite (needed only if
		you want to use npslpr's pages manipulation options)

  - includeres	from the same suite, a tool to include resources in
		PostScript files (called by psplpr if it exists to
		do resource inclusion which is not done actually).



The psplpr tool
===============

The psplpr command is used to preprocess files before they are submitted to
a system printer spooler. The preprocessing adds code got from a PPD
file to select specific features of the printer.
  The psplpr tool can also act as a stand-alone filter, thus producing
files for later printing.

The program can be used either for real PostScript printers or for
printers whose input is produced by a PostScript converter like the
Ghostscript PostScript interpreter. The program handles lpr(1) filtering
options and calls the appropriate filters before preprocessing the
resulting PostScript file.

If you make modifications to this program, please email them to me.
