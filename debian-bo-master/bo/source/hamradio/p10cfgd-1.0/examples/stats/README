These are some simple 'expect' scripts written by John Conner WD0FHG to help
gather stats from Packeten switches, along with sample outputs from some of
the scripts.  

These will require substantial modification for use in other environments, but
hopefully get the point across that interacting with a switch using 'expect'
is pretty easy.
