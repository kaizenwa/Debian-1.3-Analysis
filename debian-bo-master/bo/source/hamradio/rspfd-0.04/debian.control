PACKAGE: rspfd
DESCRIPTION: Radio Shortest Path First routing program.
 This program is used by Radio Amateurs who are running TCP/IP over the
 AX.25 packet radio protocol. It advertises the routes of your system
 in an on-air bulletin, explores the routes other systems that run RSPF,
 and sets up routes for the stations to talk to (and through) each other.
