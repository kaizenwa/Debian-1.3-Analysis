This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of Wilson How's dld package.

This package was put together by me, Guy R. Thomas <gthomas@native-ed.bc.ca>,
from the Linux-specific sources to dld-3.2.6, as distributed on tsx-11.mit.edu 
in /pub/linux/sources/libs/dld-src-3.2.5.tar.gz.

The changes are essentially the configuration for Debian GNU/Linux and the
addition of support for the Debian package maintenance scheme in the form of
various debian.* files and directories.
