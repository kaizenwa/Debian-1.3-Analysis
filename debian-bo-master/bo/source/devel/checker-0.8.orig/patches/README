Here are some files form other packages that I have changed.
They are provided so that you could compile them.  However, the binaries are
already included in ../bin/

gas.diffs (cd binutils-2.5.2/gas; patch < gas.diffs)
i386.h (gas-2.3/gas/include/opcodes/i386.h)
These file implements code insertion. Copy them, if you have gas sources.
Compile GAS with -DCHECKER option.

ld.diff is a patch for ld.c (binutils-1.9l.3 from HJ)

ld.so.diffs is a patch for ld.so version 1.5.2
