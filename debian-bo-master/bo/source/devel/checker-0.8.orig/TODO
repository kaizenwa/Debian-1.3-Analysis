		TODO file for Checker V0.8

From gingold@email.enst.fr

* more parameter to checker: size of red zone, automatic garbage collector 
  at interval, disable checker...

* protection of internal datas by chkr_check_addr()

* stop after n errors.

* garbage collector must only read pointers on 'good' zones : use the bitmaps

* watch points can be easily implemented

* options for gathering the garbages:  depth of history...

* garbage with BRK and MMAP.

* give more information (if there was an old block) with (nma).

* r_alloc

* history for sbrk.

* dwarf, coff

* use SegPage instead of SegRW, SegRonly, SegWonly to allow mprotect on the 
  .text, .data segments.

* with the stubs, it is possible to add messages such as: 'arg 1 of strcmp'...
