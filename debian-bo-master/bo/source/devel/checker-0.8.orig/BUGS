Known bugs in Checker:

* not all options in define.h are supported

* potential bugs (things that have not been tested)
  Some of the syscall checks (in linux-syscall.c) have not been tested.
  The clone syscall is not allowed.
  Some ioctl and fcntl calls have not been implemented, because I don't
    have enough information about them.

* chkr_check_addr & chkr_set_right don't work across segments.

If you find a bug in Checker (not in your program!),
 Send me your program, and how you compile it.
 If your program is big, try to find a simpler example.
 If you know exactly where the bug is (e.g. at a syscall check), send me
 an example which triggers the bug.
 If you have made a patch, send me it.
