This directory contains already compiled binaries.

The distribution 0.7 also contains a patched version of ld.so, which can
safely (I hope!) replace your old ld.so. You *don't* need it if you don't
want to use libmdchecker.a or plchecker.o
If you have a ld.so more recent than 1.5.2 (try ldd -V), I think you don't
need to install this patched version.

To install it, just do (if you are root):

 ln -f /lib/ld.so /lib/ld.so.old # save the old one
 install -c ld.so /lib/ld.so.new # install the new one
 ln -f /lib/ld.so.new /lib/ld.so
 rm /lib/ld.so.new
