Hi All,
  This is a version of BSD 4.4 make (pmake), which should compile and
run under SUNOS 4.1.1 and Linux 0.99pl10 (and above)

  If you have problems with 'arch.c' then check out the definition for RANLIBMAG,
you should be able to safely define this to be ""..

  If you are porting to a new architecture, then may I suggest you add an extra
entry in 'main.c' to define MACHINE for your machine if your headers don't define it anyway..

  Some of the ideas for how to port this came from Paul Vixie's version.
The main bits are what is in the support directory.
  Any copyrights etc on all files are fully respected.
