            FastCGI application roles, the FastCGI application
            library, server support for FastCGI, and FastCGI performance.

            Fifth International World Wide Web Conference,

        Several example programs.  The links below invoke the
        programs.  Use the section that corresponds to the
        Web server you have configured for FastCGI:
        <ul>
          <li>Open Market Secure WebServer:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/apps/echo"><tt>echo</tt></a>,
              an example program that returns a page containing all of its
              inputs -- environment variables and <tt>stdin</tt>. (Source code:
              <a href="examples/echo.c"><tt>echo.c</tt></a>.)
              Notice the FastCGI process ID in the initial
              environment (there are two <tt>echo</tt> processes
              running).  Also notice the request variables
              that carry ticketing information (<tt>SI_*</tt>);
              the anonymous ticket has been forced into the URL so you
              can see it.  Alter it if you wish -- see what happens.
            <li><a href="/apps/echo-protected"><tt>echo</tt></a>,
              the same program accessed via a URL that is access
              controlled by a simple Authorizer.
              (Source code:
              <a href="examples/tiny-authorizer.c"><tt>tiny-authorizer.c</tt></a>.)
              Authenticate with user ID <tt>fastcgi</tt> and
              password <tt>sano</tt> to gain access.  In addition
              to demonstrating Authorizer-based access control, this
              application demonstrates Authorizer-controlled session affinity:
              Use the query string
              <a href="/apps/echo-protected?0"><tt>?0</tt></a>
              to route your request to <tt>echo</tt> process 0,
              and the query string
              <a href="/apps/echo-protected?1"><tt>?1</tt></a>
              to route your request to <tt>echo</tt> process 1.
            <li><a href="/SampleStore/App"><tt>sample-store</tt></a>,
              a more realistic example. (Source code:
              <a href="examples/sample-store.c"><tt>sample-store.c</tt></a>.)
              This shopping cart implementation demonstrates how
              FastCGI applications can get high performance using
              in-memory caching yet preserve data across crashes.
              Request routing is controlled by the anonymous ticket in
              the URL; if you erase your ticket you'll get a new
              shopping cart.  Using <tt>ps</tt>, locate and kill the
              two <tt>sample-store</tt> processes; the Web server will
              restart them and the new processes will recover your
              shopping cart.  The program also illustrates how a
              single application can play multiple roles.
          </ul>
          <li>NCSA and Apache servers:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="examples/echo.fcg"><tt>echo</tt></a>,
              an example program that returns a page containing all of its
              inputs -- environment variables and <tt>stdin</tt>. (Source code:
              <a href="examples/echo.c"><tt>echo.c</tt></a>.)
          </ul>
           <li>Any Web server, using <tt>cgi-fcgi</tt>:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="examples/echo.cgi"><tt>echo</tt></a>,
              an example program that returns a page containing all of its
              inputs -- environment variables and <tt>stdin</tt>. (Source code:
              <a href="examples/echo.c"><tt>echo.c</tt></a>.)
          </ul>
