This directory contains several registrar clients:

*  open.reg.tcl is the "normal" GroupKit open registration system

*  rm_conf.tcl is a super-user version which allows deleting any conference;
   this is useful to get rid of "phantom" conferences that GroupKit
   sometimes leaves behind.

*  command.reg.tcl is a command line client, suitable for starting 
   programs when you start up X for example

There are three others included here, which are experimental:

*  facil.reg.tcl is a control panel for a facilitated registrar client,
   where a single user (the facilitator) controls what tools (conferences)
   other users in a facilitated meeting may use

*  slave.reg.tcl is a registrar client for the non-facilitator users in
   a facilitated meeting; "slave" is in the sense that the facilitator
   controls what conferences the user accesses

*  rooms.reg.tcl is a rooms-based client, where conferences are placed
   into a room; "walking" into the room joins you to all conferences
   therein, and leaving a room deletes you from them
