README for the "megaconf" sample conference
-------------------------------------------

This conference takes a slightly different approach than the normal
GroupKit system.  Rather than every application in its own process
and window, here we embed a number of "applets" into a single process
and window; a sort of "poor man's groupkit meets opendoc".  Every tool
is built as an individual object, so if you've been cringing ever
since GroupKit moved away from C++ this may be of some interest!

The system uses [incr Tcl] as the basis for building tools, so you'll
have to have that installed.  You'll also need to build a version
of gkwish that includes [incr Tcl].  This is no longer a supported
option in GroupKit, so you'll have to add it yourself to the
tkAppInit.c file (see the installation instructions that come with
[incr Tcl]).

You'll also have to add the appropriate line into your .groupkitrc:

   userprefs "prog.MegaConf.cmd" \
        "exec gkitclwish -f $gk_library/contrib/megaconf/megaconf.tcl"

There are three example conference applets: a whiteboard program,
a chatting tool, and a postit note.  If you want to create more, 
you'll have to add in code to two routines in megaconf.tcl, namely
"makeRoomControls" and "createObjInternals".
