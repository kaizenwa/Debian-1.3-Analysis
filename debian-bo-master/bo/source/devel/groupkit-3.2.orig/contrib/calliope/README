This directory contains Calliope, a prototype collaborative
editor written using the GroupKit groupware toolkit.

To use Calliope, first install GroupKit, available from the 
University of Calgary.  Their web page is found at:
http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/projects/grouplab/projects/groupkit.

All the files in the Calliope package should be copied into a
directory called "calliope" in $GK_LIBRARY/contrib.

Then add the following lines to your ~.groupkitrc:

userprefs "prog.Calliope.cmd" \
          "exec gkwish -f $gk_library/contrib/calliope/calliope.tcl"
userprefs "prog.Calliope.group" "Text Editors"

Reinitialize your registrar client, and you should be able to run Calliope

Information on Calliope can be found at:
