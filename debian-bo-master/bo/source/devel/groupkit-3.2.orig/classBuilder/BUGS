The biggest problem with this application is the manner in which
the inherited options and commands get applied to the new class.
It would be nice if these could automatically be applied to the new 
class in an appropriate manner, such as to all of the subwidgets.
However, because not all widgets act alike in tcl/tk it is left up to
the designer of the new class to specify how the options and commands
are used in the new class.  As a result errors can occur if this
is not done.

The current way in which the commands are used in a new class
has not been fully tested so it is very likely that there are
errors.  

Another improvement would be to eliminate either the procedure
CreateClassRec or InitWidgetRec since both have similar effects.

Also better error messages should be added, it is not always clear
what the problem is from the error messages that are currently 
generated.
