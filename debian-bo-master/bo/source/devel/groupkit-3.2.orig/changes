   gk_views widget and the new gk_popup widget.

6. 8/30/95 (new feature) gk_popup.  This basically is a couple of duplicated

    in the environment - makes it more general

12. 8/24/95 (changes/enhancements) classBuilder.  Better reporting of
    errors, they are no longer hidden.  Allows inheritance from any 
    widget widget that gkwish knows how to construct, before it only 
    allowed stanard Tk widgets and those using the classBuilder.
    Added a "cget" command in order to be compatible with tk4.0.
    Root window of a widget can now be any standard tk widget, not
    just a frame, and is specified with the classes "rootWindow" 
    variable.  The options/optionValues given by the command that
    creates the widget are now stored in the widget's record during
    creation time only, they are specified by widgetRec(tmpOptionName).

    widget.
