% This module traverses the goal for each procedure, looking
% for conjunctions containing assignment unifications to or from
% a variable that is local to the conjunction.  Such unifications
% effectively just introduce a new local name for a variable.
% This module optimizes away such unifications by replacing all
% occurrences of the local name with the other name.
%
% Note that the output of this pass is not in super-homogeneous form,
% since if two equivalent variables are passed in two argument positions,
% they will not be distinct after this pass. This is not a problem, since
% this pass occurs after the passes that rely on super-homogeneous form.
%
% This HLDS-to-HLDS optimization is applied after the front end has
% completed all of its semantic checks (i.e. after determinism analysis),
% but before code generation.
% 
% It allows optimizations such as middle recursion to be simplified, 
% and it reduces the pressure on the stack slot allocator.
