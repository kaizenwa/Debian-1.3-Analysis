This file contains a checklist of the steps that must be
taken when releasing a new version of Mercury.

1.  Update the version number in
	README
	INSTALL (various places)
	bindist/bindist.README
	bindist/bindist.INSTALL
	bindist/bindist.configure.in
	configure.in
	library/library.m
    and update the NEWS and RELEASE_NOTES files.  The RELEASE_NOTES file
    should include the contents of the NEWS file.

2.  Checkout a fresh copy, and do
	autoconf
	mercury_cv_low_tag_bits=2 sh configure
	mmake MMAKEFLAGS='MCFLAGS="-O5 --num-tag-bits 2" -j4' tar

3.  Fix the tar file so that it unpacks into the directory `mercury-<version>'
    rather than `mercury'.

4.  Test it on lots of architectures.

5.  Copy the gzipped tar file to ~fjh/www_public/mercury, and
    to the turiel ftp site ftp://turiel.cs.mu.oz.au/pub/mercury.
    Email kostis@cs.sunysb.edu (Konstantinos Sagonas) to tell him
    to make copies of it on ftp://ftp.cs.sunysb.edu/pub/XSB/mercury
    respectively.
    The mirror on ftp://ftp.csd.uu.se/pub/Mercury is automated.

6.  Email mercury-announce@cs.mu.oz.au and cross-post announcement to
    comp.lang.misc, comp.lang.prolog, comp.lang.functional, comp.object.logic,
    and for major releases also to comp.compilers and gnu.announce.

7.  Update the Mercury WWW home page (/local/dept/www/mercury/mercury.html).
