To create a binary distribution on Windows 95 or Windows NT:

	- first install from the source distribution (see ../README.MS-Windows)

	- s/mdemangle/mdemangle.exe/ and s/mkinit/mkinit.exe/
	  in bindist/Mmakefile and bindist/bindist.Makefile.in

	- then just do `mmake bindist' in the bindist directory
	  (it may go into an infinite loop, but only _after_
	  producing the .tar.gz file, so if it does, just kill it)
