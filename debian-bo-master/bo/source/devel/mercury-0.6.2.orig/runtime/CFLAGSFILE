# Use these options for optimizing compiles with gcc
# -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -DSPEED

# Use this with gcc if you want to look at the .s files
# -fverbose-asm
# (and add -mrnames for mips register names, if you want)

# use to preserve the cpp output with gcc
# -save-temps

# use to debug gcc's flow analysis
# -dr -df -ds

# Use these options for debugging compiles
-g 

# Enable this option if you want to measure the number of times
# each register is used.  Note that the measurement includes
# uses which occur inside debugging routines, so to get an accurate
# count you need to disable all the debugging routines by compiling
# with -DSPEED and not using any -d* flags.
# -DMEASURE_REGISTER_USAGE -DSPEED

# Use this option if you want to include call profiling information.
# -DPROFILE_CALLS

# Use this option if you want to include time profiling information.
# -DPROFILE_TIME

# Use this option with -DSPEED if you want minimal (relatively efficient)
# debugging
# -DDEBUG_GOTOS

# Use this option with -DSPEED if don't want debugging, but you do want
# to support the `-w' (entry point) command
# -DDEBUG_LABELS
