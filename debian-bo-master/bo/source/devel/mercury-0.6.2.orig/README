This directory contains the source distribution for the University of Melbourne
Mercury compiler, version 0.6.

The Mercury implementation is free software, but it is Copyright (C)
1994-1996 The University of Melbourne.  It is distributed under the terms
of the GNU General Public License.  See the file COPYING for copying
permission.  The Mercury library and runtime (the files in the library
and runtime subdirectories) are distributed under the terms of the GNU
Library General Public License.  See the file COPYING.LIB for copying
permissions for those files.  (If those licencing arrangements are not
satisfactory, please contact us!  We are willing to offer alternative
arrangements, if the need should arise.)  The subdirectory `boehm_gc'
contains a conservative garbage collector distributed by Hans Boehm -
see the file README in that directory for copyright information about
those files.  A few files (config*, runtime/timing.c) are derived from
code that is copyright by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.  The
program `texi2html' in the doc directory is copyright by CERN; see the
copyright notice at the end of that file.

THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  ANY USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  See the file COPYING.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
But first read README.IRIX-5, README.AIX, or README.BSDI if you are
installing on a machine running IRIX 5, AIX, or BSD Unix.

The documentation sources are in the `doc' subdirectory.  The installation
process will install INFO, HTML, and DVI versions in the locations specified
in the file Mmake.common - by default these locations are
/usr/local/mercury-0.6/info, /usr/local/mercury-0.6/lib/mercury/html,
and /usr/local/mercury-0.6/lib/mercury/doc respectively.
The files RELEASE_NOTES, NEWS, HISTORY, LIMITATIONS, and BUGS
also contain useful information.  If you're interested in looking
at the source code, the file compiler/notes/COMPILER_DESIGN is
a good place to start.
