Comments:

	C bug during installation of Icon:
   
	   When an #include is encounted in conditional code that is *not*
	   selected and the file name is supplied via a defined constant,
	   the C preprocessor produces the message "bad include syntax". This
	   is a known System V C preprocessor bug. If this bug is encountered,
	   comment out the offending #include statements and continue with
	   "make Icon". The statements are not selected so this has no
	   effect on the resulting system.

	Keyboard Functions:

	   Most 386 UNICES support the keyboard functions getch(), getche()
	   and kbhit().  They will not be defined by default, unless they
	   are found to work on all available SysV/386 systems.  To try
	   out keyboard functions, add the following two lines to your
	   define.h file (see configuration notes for more information):

	   #define KeyboardFncs
	   #define HaveTermio
