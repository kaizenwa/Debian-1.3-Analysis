Comments:

	iconc invokes cc without the -O flag (see #define COpts "" in define.h)
	to avoid an obsure C optimizer bug.

	(Added 2/4/91 by Steve Wampler):
	(1) On our version of Ultrix (3.0) the Makefile in ~/src/runtime
	dies instantly.  This is apparently a bug in the Ultrix make,
	not in the makefile.  Adding a '-' in front of the if ([ ! -f rt.a...
	fixes the problem.

        (2) Also for Ultrix 3.0, the -O option needs to be removed from
	~/config/unix/dec_3100/rtt.hdr   Otherwise, strange errors
	result when trying to run rtt.
