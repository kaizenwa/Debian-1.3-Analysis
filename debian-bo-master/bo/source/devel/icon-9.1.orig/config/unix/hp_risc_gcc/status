System configuration:

	HP 9000 RISC using HPUX/9.05 and gcc-2.6.3

Latest Icon version:

	Version 9 compiler and interpreter

Installer:

	Neal Becker


Known bugs:

	None.

Comments:

	(These are from a former configuration and may no apply here.)

	HP/UX uses the LPATH environment variable as a path to the linker.
	This conflicts with the use of LPATH in link declarations under
	the Icon compiler.

	The pdco test fails when compiled by iconc because it requires a
	larger-than-default co-expression stack size.  It runs successfully
	if then environment variable COEXPSIZE is set to 200000.
