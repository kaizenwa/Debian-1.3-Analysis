System configuration:

	PS/2 Model 80 running AIX V1.1

Latest Icon version:

	Version 7.6 compiler

Installer:

	...{uunet}!{decwrl,apple}!metaphor!laguna!alex

Missing features:

	None

Known bugs:

	As of this writing, the compiler-generated C code must be
	compiled without optimization (as is the default for the PS/2
	AIX implementation) -- some bugs exist if optimization is
	used.

	Some anomalies have been discovered in transcendental functions
	(e.g. acos(1.0) -> -6.12), probably due to library bugs.
