Comments:

	The Icon installation guide gives the standard directory for
	an installation as /usr/icon/v8. CDC's UNIX (VX) has a root directory
	that includes /usr but this directory is owned by the system. The
	permissions would not allow writes.

	One way around this is to use the $USER catalog of NOS/VE. In VX,
	$USER is known as /nve/user_name (/nve/icon in paths.h, which assumes
	a user icon). The VX command 'cd' takes you there. You can read or
	write with no problems to this directory (in VX or NOS/VE). For these
	reasons, Icon is installed in $USER (/nve/icon). This implies that
	anyone else will have to change the path by using their user_name.

	In your VX profile (.profile), you can supply the command
	'cd icon/v8' to point to the right directory.
	
	VX has no 'strip' command. You may have to edit a file or two to get
	rid of the 'strip's.
	
	From the testing I did, there appears to be on our system an upper
	limit for VX memory allocation. This limit usually is hit by the UNIX's
	system command. If a child process is spawned by system, you possibly
	need two times your memory allocation (there could be other sub-
	processes executing that take up more memory). Anyway, the chosen
	numbers allow for 68K of Icon interpreter code. If your system has a
	fair amount of memory on NOS/VE, you probably can increase the numbers.

	The configuration for VX as provided by John Zimmer includes several
	changes to the main source code (under control of the defined
	constant CDC_VXVE).  By the time these changes were received, the
	source code had changed considerably.  It is now known if all the
	changes were installed correctly or whether changes in the source
	code since are valid for VX.
