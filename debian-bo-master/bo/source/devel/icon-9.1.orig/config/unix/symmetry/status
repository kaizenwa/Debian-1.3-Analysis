System configuration:

	Sequent Symmetry running Dynix 3.1.2

Latest Icon version:

	Version 9.0 compiler and interpreter

Installer:

	Cliff Hathaway
	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

Missing features:

	Keyboard functions.

Known bugs:

	Some old compilers can't handle #elif; there's one in
	src/icont/tmain.c.

Comments:

	rtt invokes cc without the -O flag (see #define COpts "" in define.h)
	becuase cc produces incorrect code for a loop in create() from the
	file rcoexpr.rtt. Note, iconc uses the same cc flags as rtt.

	Keyboard functions are not enabled because type-ahead is discarded
	when tty modes are changed.
