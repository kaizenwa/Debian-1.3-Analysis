System configuration:

	VAX-11 running 4.3bsd

Latest Icon version:

	Version 7.6+ compiler

Installer:

	Ken Walker
	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

Missing features:

	None.

Known bugs:


	None.

Comments:

	This configuration should also work for 4.2bsd.

	iconc invokes cc without the -O flag (see #define COpts "" in define.h)
	to avoid a cc optimizer bug resulting in assembler error messages
	of the form

	  "/tmp/ctm210113", line 8576: brw: Branch too far(-33287b): try -J flag

	This can also be solved by stopping the C compilation at the assembler
	code and explitely invoking the assembler with -J. iconc should be
	changed to do this automatically for Vax bsd systems.
