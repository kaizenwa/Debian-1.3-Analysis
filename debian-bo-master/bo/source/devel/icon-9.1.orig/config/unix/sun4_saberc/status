System configuration:

	Sun Sparcstation using Saber C interpreter

Latest Icon version:

	Version 8.5 compiler and interpreter

Installer:

	Ken Walker
	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

Missing features:

	*** NOT ALL COMPONENTS ARE CURRENTLY SET UP TO BUILD UNDER SABER C ***
        *** SEE COMMENTS ****

Known bugs:

	Saber C cannot include a file using a preprocessor constant.
	This requires manually changing src/preproc/preproc.h

Comments:

	This configuration is for testing Icon developement, rather
	than installing a production system.

	After configuring with "make Configure name=saber_c", do an
        ordinary build of the system - this uses gcc.

        Then, in the selected component, start Saber C (for example,
        via xsaber under X windows). Within Saber C do

           make saber

        This uses information in the Makefile to load the source files
	(except for the output of yacc which is loaded as an object
	file, becuase it has some things which cause Saber C to complain
	during execution). Now use Saber C commands to examine, run, and
	otherwise debug.

	Components with "make saber" entries:
		iconc
		rtt (but see note under bugs)
