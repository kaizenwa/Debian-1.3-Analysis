System configuration:

	Unix System V/386 (ESIX System V Release 3.2D)

Latest Icon version:

	Version 8.10 compiler and interpreter

Installer:

	Clint Jeffery
	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

Missing features:

	None

Known bugs:

	None.

Comments:

	C compiler flags:

	   It is necessary to remove the "-p -w" options from the Makefile
	   in tests/general, since this compiler won't accept them.

	C warnings during installation of Icon:
   
	   When an #include is encounted in conditional code that is *not*
	   selected and the file name is supplied via a defined constant,
	   the C preprocessor produces the message "bad include syntax". This
	   is a known System V C preprocessor bug. If this bug is encountered,
	   comment out the offending #include statements and continue with
	   "make Icon". The statements are not selected so this has no
	   effect on the resulting system.

	Keyboard Functions:

	   Most 386 UNIXes support the keyboard functions getch(), getche()
	   and kbhit().  They will not be defined by default, unless they
	   are found to work on all available SysV/386 systems.  To try
	   out keyboard functions, add the following two lines to your
	   define.h file (see configuration notes for more information):

	   #define KeyboardFncs
	   #define HaveTermio

	X-Icon Releases

	   ESIX comes with X11R3, which means it doesn't support the
	   X-Icon function XIconic().  If you are running X11 R4 or R5,
	   remove the line:
	   
	   #define NoIconify
	   
	   from define.h.

	X-Icon Libraries:

	   ESIX uses non-default libraries in addition to -lX11.
	   If you are using another Sys V/386 you may need to adjust
	   the libraries required for X in xiconc.def and xiconx.mak.
