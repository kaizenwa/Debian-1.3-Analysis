System configuration:

	System V Release 4

Latest Icon version:

	Version 8.6 compiler and interpreter

Installer:

	Ralph E. Griswold
	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

Missing features:

	None

Known bugs:

	With ESIIX 4.0, stack overflow occurs for the X test programs
	calib.icn and sensdemo.icn.  This may be because they use mutable
	colors and may be an ESIX X server problem.

Comments:

	It is necessary to remove the "-p -w" options from the Makefile
	in tests/general to test the Icon C compiler in non-optimized mode,
	since 386 System V C compilers don't accept the -w option.
