Comments:

	This is a configuration for Solaris using the SunPro C compiler.
	It is VERY IMPORTANT that /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc precede /usr/ucb/cc
	in your search path -- or that /usr/ucb/cc be absent from the path.

	This configuration uses no Berkeley or SunOS 4.x compatibility files;
	it was built with PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/SUNWspro/bin.
	The Makefiles assume that OpenWindows is in /usr/openwin.

	The Sun C compiler (/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc) produces code which
	generates spurious runtime errors for the seq() Icon function
	for values less than or equal to -2 with the -O option
	(equivalent to -xO2).  CFLAGS is set to -xO1 in runtime.hdr.
