Comments:

	Overflow checking is included, but has not been well tested.
	Co-expressions are included; "make Test-coexpr" ran O.K.

	Note that the clock-rate for Stride 400 Series is 100 Hz; for
 	Stride/Millennium 700 Series it is 128 Hz (CHECK THIS).
	This necessitates a line in "define.h": #define Hz 100
