The following comments about Icon compilation, somewhat edited, were
provided by Sebastian Rahtz:

To recompile Icon, you should get yourself to .../icon/v8, and then
do 

   make Setup name=masscomp

followed by

   make Icon Install

But before you do this, edit .../icon/v8/setup/masscomp/paths.h to
reflect your intentions. This is the current contents of the file
at our installation:

#define RootPath "/u/staff/spqr/icon/v8"
#define IcontPath "/u/staff/spqr/icon/v8/bin/icont"
#define IconxPath "/u/staff/spqr/icon/v8/bin/iconx"
#define HeaderPath "/u/staff/spqr/icon/v8/bin/iconx.hdr"

Presumably you change all of these to be /usr/local/icon or whatever,
Who knows! Have fun. Compilation takes about 20 minutes or less.
