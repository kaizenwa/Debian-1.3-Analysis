System configuration:

	Intel 386-type processor running FreeBSD-2.0

Latest Icon version:

	Version 9.0

Installer:

	Thomas Gellekum
	<thomas@ghpc8.ihf.rwth-aachen.de>

Missing features:

	All normally defined features should be present, including
	co-expressions.  I believe the missing features are
	executable image saving and calling Icon from C. See comments.

Known bugs:

	None.

Comments:

	I ported icon because some other package needed it. At least
	the tests ran successfully apart from minor differences, and
	the aforementioned package seems to work.
