Comments:

	Early versions of Ultrix (like ours, 3.0) have a bug in make
	that shows up when trying to do a make in ~/src/runtime.
	Change the '@' on the first 'if' action to a '-' to fix the
	problem.  (2/21/91)

	You have to do the same thing to the Makefile in ../Generic
	(change all '@'s to '-'s).
