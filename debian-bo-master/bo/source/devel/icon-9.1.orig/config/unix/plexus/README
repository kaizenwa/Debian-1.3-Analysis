This directory contains the sources and configuration files to 
compile Icon 6.0 on a 68000 based Plexus P-60 or P-35 under System V.
(My guess is that this will also work with the 68020 based P-75, but
I have no way to test that.)

NOTE that there is a bug in the C compiler which causes the command
	cc -O x.s
to produce a null output file. (The command works fine if you leave
the -O off.)  The only files this effects are `rswitch.s' and `rover.s'.
There are two possible solutions:

	1. Remove the -O option from the file `iconx.hdr' in this directory.

	2. Explicitly compile rswitch and rover prior to running make. The
	procedure is as follows:
		make Setup name=plexus_m68
		cd src/iconx
		as rswitch.s
		as rover.s
		cd ../..
		make Icon Install




---- SYSTEM III ---
This same configuration should work with System III, with the possible
exception of the files `rswitch.s' and `rover.s'.  System III uses a
different C compiler and assembler so those two files may be incompatible.
