Comments:

	This configuration uses the Cygnus gcc compiler, which can be
	obtained by anonymous FTP from the vendor/cygnus directory on
	ftp.uu.net.

	This configuration uses no Berkeley or SunOS 4.x compatibility
	files; it was built with PATH=/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/cygnus/bin.
	The Makefiles assume that OpenWindows is in /usr/openwin.
