System configuration:

	486 running Solaris 2.1 with Sun cc compiler.

Latest Icon version:

	Version 8.10 compiler and interpreter

Installer:

	Kenneth Walker

Missing features:

	Executable images

Known bugs:

	None

Comments:

	I used the sun4_solaris and i386_svr4 configruations as starting
	points. The following comment was inherited from sun4_solaris:

	  This configuration uses no Berkeley or SunOS 4.x compatibility
	  files; it was built with PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/SUNWspro/bin.
	  The Makefiles assume that OpenWindows is in /usr/openwin.
	  The Sun C compiler (/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc) produces code which
	  generates spurious runtime errors for the seq() Icon function
	  for values less than or equal to -2 with the -O option
	  (equivalent to -xO2).  I set CFLAGS to be -xO1 in runtime.hdr.
