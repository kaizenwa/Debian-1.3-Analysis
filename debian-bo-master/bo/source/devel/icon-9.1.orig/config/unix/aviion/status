Missing features:

	Co-expressions

Known bugs:

	None

Comments:

	Requires gcc version 2 (supplied with DG/UX 5.4.1) to compile.
	May or may not work under DG/UX 5.4, which only comes with
	gcc version 1.

	The prototype for 'getopt()' as supplied with Icon 8.6 conflicts
	with the prototype provided in <stdlib.h> by DG.  You need to
	change the Icon 8.6 prototype (in src/h/cproto.h) and definition
	(in src/common/getopt.c) to match the DG version:

        int getopt Params((int nargs, char *const*nargv, const char *ostr));
