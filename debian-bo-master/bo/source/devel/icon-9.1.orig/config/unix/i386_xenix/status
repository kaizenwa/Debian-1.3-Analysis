	   and kbhit().  They will not be defined by default, unless they
	   are found to work on all available SysV/386 systems.  To try
	   out keyboard functions, add the following two lines to your
	   define.h file (see configuration notes for more information):

	   #define KeyboardFncs
	   #define HaveTermio
