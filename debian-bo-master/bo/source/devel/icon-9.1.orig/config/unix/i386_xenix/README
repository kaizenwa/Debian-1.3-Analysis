In some versions of XENIX, signal.o must be loaded before any
user modules. If it is not, there is a "fix-up" error.  If this
happens in loading iconx, extract signal.o from its library:

	cd /lib
	ar x Llibc.a signal.o

and move Localisms.old to Localisms in this directory. That
will cause the Makefile for iconx to be modified accordingly.
Note it is necessary to run

	make Configure name=pc_xenix again

after doing this.
