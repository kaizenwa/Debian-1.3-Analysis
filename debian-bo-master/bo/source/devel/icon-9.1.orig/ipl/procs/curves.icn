#  This file links procedure files that generate traces of points on various
#  plain curves.
#
#  The first two parameters deterimine the defining position of the
#  curve:
#
#	x	x coordinate
#	y	y coordinate
#
#  The meaning of "definition position" depends on the curve.  In some
#  cases it is the position at which plotting starts.  In others, it
#  is a "center" for the curve.
#
#  The next arguments vary and generally refer to parameters of the
#  curve.  There is no practical way to describe these here.  If they
#  are not obvious, the best reference is
#
#	A Catalog of Special Plane Curves, J. Dennis Lawrence,
#	Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1972.
#
#  This book, which is in print at the time of this writing, is a
#  marvelous source of information about plane curves and is inexpensive
#  as well.
#
#  The trailing parameters give the number of steps and the end points
#  (generally in angles) of the curves:
#  
#	steps	number of points, default varies
#	lo	beginning of plotting range, default varies
#	hi	end of plotting range, default varies
#
#  Because of floating-point roundoff, the number of steps
#  may not be exactly the number specified.
#
#  Note:  Some of the curves may be "upside down" when plotted on
#  coordinate systems in which the y axis increases in a downward direction.
#
#  Caution:  Some of these procedures generate very large values
#  in portions of their ranges.  These may cause run-time errors when
#  used in versions of Icon prior to 8.10.  One work-around is to
#  turn on error conversion in such cases.
#
#  Warning:  The procedures that follow have not been tested thoroughly.
#  Corrections and additions are most welcome.
#
#  These  procedures are, in fact, probably most useful for the parametric
#  equations they contain.
