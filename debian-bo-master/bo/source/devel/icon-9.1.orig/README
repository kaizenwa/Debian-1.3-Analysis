Please note:  There is both an interpreter and a compiler for Icon on
some platforms.  For most uses, the interpreter is preferrable.  It
gets into execution quickly and is fast enough for many applications.  The
compiler produces programs that run faster than the interpreter, but
it is requires a large amount of memory and disk space and is slow to
get into execution.  In addition, we no longer are able to maintain
the compiler.
