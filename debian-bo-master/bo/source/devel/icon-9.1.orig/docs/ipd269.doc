1.__Introduction

   The Icon program library consists of Icon programs, pro-
cedures, documentation, and data. Version 9.1 of Icon is required
for graphics and some other parts of the library of the library
[1,2].

   Section 7 lists the contents of the library. More compete
documentation is contained in comments in the program and pro-
cedure files.  There also is separate documentation for some pro-
grams. See the hierarchy below.


2.__Unloading_the_Library

   Note: The complete library, when unloaded, requires about
5.5MB of disk space. In particular, some documents in PostScript
form are quite large. If your disk space is limited, take this
into consideration before starting to unload.

   The library is designed to be unloaded in a hierarchy that
contains separate directories for different kinds of material.
Material that requires graphics [2] is in separate directories
whose names begin with g. If Icon doesn't support graphics on
your platform, you can ignore these directories.

   The directory structure for this version of the library is

        |--data                    data
        |
        |--docs                    documentation
        |
        |--incl                    include files
        |
        |--packs                   packages
        |
        |--procs                   procedures
        |
        |--progs                   programs
|--ipl--|
        |--gdata                   as above, but for graphics
        |
        |--gdocs
        |
        |--gincl
        |
        |--gpacks
        |

        |--gprocs
        |
        |--gprogs
        |
        |--cfuncs                  loadable C functions



   The packages contain material that is too complex fit into
other parts of the hierarchy or that does not conform to the
library structure.

   The loadable C functions are for platforms on which Icon sup-
ports the built-in function loadfuncs(). See the README in that
directory for more information.

   The library files are packaged in different ways for different
platforms. See the installation instructions for your platform.


3.__Link_and_Include_Search_Paths

   Many library programs link procedures. For example, options()
is used by many programs for processing command-line options and
is linked from ``ucode'' files obtained from translating
options.icn.

   Icon searches for ucode files first in the current directory
and then in directories specified by the IPATH environment vari-
able.  IPATH consists of a sequence of blank-separated path
names. The search is in the order of the names. For example, on a
UNIX system running csh,

        setenv IPATH "../procs /usr/icon/ilib"


results in a search for file names in link declarations first in
the current directory, then in ../procs, and finally in
/usr/icon/ilib.

   Files included by the preprocessor directive $include are
searched for on LPATH. It has the same form as IPATH.

   The method of setting IPATH and LPATH varies from system to
system.

   Since the current directory always is searched first, IPATH
and LPATH need not be set if ucode and include files are placed
in the same directory as the program files.  See the next sec-
tion.

4.__Installing_the_Library

   Installing the Icon program library consists of two steps: (1)
translating the procedure files to produce ucode files and (2)
translating and linking the programs.

   Ucode files are produced by translating the procedure files
with the -c option to icont, as in

        icont -c options

which translates options.icn. The result is two ucode files named
options.u1 and options.u2. The .u1 file contains the procedure's
code and the .u2 file contains global information about the pro-
cedure.  It is these files that a link declaration such as

        link options

needs.

   Scripts for translating the procedure files are provided with
the distribution.  Once the procedure files have been translated,
the ucode files can be moved to any place that is accessible from
IPATH.

   The programs are translated and linked using icont without the
-c option, as in

        icont deal


which translates and links deal.icn, a program that produces ran-
domly selected bridge hands. The result of translating and link-
ing a program is an ``icode'' file.  On some systems, the name of
the icode file is the same as the name of the program file with
the .icn suffix removed (for example, deal). On other systems,
the icode file name has the suffix .icx in place of .icn (for
example, deal.icx).  Scripts for translating and linking the pro-
grams are provided with distributions for individual platforms.
Instructions for building the programs contained in separate
packages are included with those packages.

   Some systems (UNIX, for example) support the direct execution
of icode files.  On such systems, an icode file can be run just
by entering its name on the command line, as in

        deal


   On other systems, it is necessary to run iconx with the icode
file as an argument, as in

        iconx deal

(This also works on systems that support direct execution.) Note
that the suffix (if any) need not be mentioned.

   Many library programs take arguments and options from the com-
mand line. Options are identified by dashes. For example, in

        deal -h 10

the -h 10 instructs deal to produce 10 hands.

   Icode files can be moved to any location accessible from your
PATH. Ucode and include files are needed only during linking.
They need not be accessible when icode files are run.


5.__Usage_Notes

   It is important to read the documentation at the beginning of
programs and procedures in the library. It includes information
about special requirements, limitations, known bugs, and so
forth.

   Some of the programs in the Icon program library are quite
large and may require more memory than is available on some plat-
forms.

8.__Contributions_to_the_Icon_Program_Library

   New material for the Icon program library always is welcome.
It must be prepared in the style exemplified by the material in
this release. Adequate documentation is essential; it must be in
the format used for present library - we do not have the
resources to rewrite or reformat contributed documentation. Test
data also must be provided - at least enough so that we can
determine that the contributed program material is basically
functional. In cases where test data is impractical because of
the nature of the contribution, instructions for testing must be
provided.

   Program material can be submitted by electronic mail at one of
the addresses given in the next section or on Macintosh or MS-DOS
disks.  Printed listings are not acceptable.

   Contributions to the Icon program library must be free of any
restrictions and may not carry copyright notices, even if accom-
panied by permission for unlimited copying.

   The decision to include contributed material in the Icon pro-
gram library rests entirely with the Icon Project.  The Icon Pro-
ject reserves the right to modify submissions to conform to
library standards, to correct errors, and to make improvements.
Contributors will be consulted in the case of substantial
changes.


9.__Feedback

   If you encounter problems with material in the Icon program
library, please let us know.  If you can provide corrections or
improvements to library material, please send them by electronic
mail or on a diskette.
