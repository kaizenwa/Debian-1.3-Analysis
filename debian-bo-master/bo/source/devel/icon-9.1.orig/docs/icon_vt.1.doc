NAME
  icon_vt - construct Icon variant translator system

SYNOPSIS
  icon_vt

DESCRIPTION
  An Icon variant translator system is a facility for constructing preproces-
  sors for variants of Icon.

  To set up a variant translator system, a new directory should be created
  solely for its use; otherwise files may be accidentally destroyed by the
  set-up process.  For the purpose of example, suppose this directory is
  named vt. The set-up process consists of

       mkdir vt
       cd vt
       icon_vt

  Note that icon_vt must be run in the area in which the variant translator
  system is to be built.

  The shell script icon_vt constructs two subdirectories: h and itran. The
  subdirectory h contains header files that are needed in C routines. The
  subdirectory itran contains the translator proper.

  The main directory in which icon_vt is run contains a Makefile and auxili-
  ary files needed to construct a variant translator, which is named vitran.
  The two files variant.defs and variant.c initially are placeholders.  It is
  in these files that the variant is described by macro specifications and
  any needed C support routines.  A make in this directory produces a trans-
  lator, vitran.  If variant.def and variant.c are left empty, the result is
  an identity translator.

  If the input syntax of the variant translator is different from that of
  Icon, it is necessary to modify the Icon grammar, which is in
  itran/icon_g.c.

OPTIONS

  -m  Preprocess each .icn source file with the m4(1) macro processor.

  -s  Suppress informative messages.  Normally, both informative messages and
      error messages are sent to standard error output.

  -P  Suppress #line directives in the output. This option may be necessary
      to prevent #line directives from occurring in places that result in
      syntactically incorrect output.

FILES
  v9/vtran  code for building personalized interpreters
