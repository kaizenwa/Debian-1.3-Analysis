	* Makefile.in: Remove extraneous whitespace from empty line.
 	It confuses some makes (like BSD's).

	* expect.tests/expect-tests.exp: Make sure the test case sources
	actually exist before sourcing them.

        * testsuite: made modifications to testcases, etc., to allow
        them to work properly  given the reorganization of deja-gnu and the
        relocation of the testcases from deja-gnu to a "tool" subdirectory.

Sun Feb 21 10:55:55 1993  Mike Werner  (mtw@poseidon.cygnus.com)

	* testsuite: Initial creation of expect/testsuite.
	Migrated dejagnu testcases and support files for testing nm to
	expect/testsuite from deja-gnu.  These files were moved "as is"
	with no modifications.  This migration is part of a major overhaul
	of dejagnu.  The modifications to these testcases, etc., which
	will allow them to work with the new version of dejagnu will be
	made in a future update.
