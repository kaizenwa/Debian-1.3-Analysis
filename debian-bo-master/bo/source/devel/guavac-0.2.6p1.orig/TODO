List of needed and desired changes to guavac, in no particular order:

The biggest thing that is needed is a more intelligent dependancy analysis.
Right now, guavac works great if you are compiling one source file against
any number of .class files, but it has serious problems with multiple
uncompiled sources, especially when faced with circular dependancies.  This
is a really hard problem, and all of my half-efforts to fix it have failed.

Support for Java 1.1.

Traverse code after generation, verify stack sizes.

Can't access protected fields/methods through instances, only through
inheritance.

Can only declare 'throws' for subclasses of parent's thrown classes.

Expand error reporting to give more errors in a method after failure.  (hard)
