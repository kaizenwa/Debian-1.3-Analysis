.SH "DESCRIPTION"
DOC++ is a documentation system for C/C++ and Java generating both LaTeX output
for high quality hardcopies and HTML output for sophisticated online browsing
of your documentation. The documentation is extracted directly from the C++
header or Java class files.
.PP
Here is a list of highlights:
.IP - 
heirarchically structured documentation
.IP - 
automatic class graph generation (as Java applets for HTML)
.IP - 
cross references
.IP - 
high end formating support including typesetting of equations
.PP
The documentation for doc++ is distributed only as HTML and postscript,
since this can be automatically generated from the source code. They are
all held in the 
.I /usr/doc/doc++ 
directory.
