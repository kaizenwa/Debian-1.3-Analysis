NAME
     xxgdb - X window system interface to the gdb debugger.

SYNOPSIS
     xxgdb [ -_t_o_o_l_k_i_t_o_p_t_i_o_n ... ] [-_x_x_g_d_b_o_p_t_i_o_n ... ] [-_g_d_b_o_p_t_i_o_n
     ... ] [_o_b_j_f_i_l_e [ _c_o_r_e_f_i_l_e ]]

DESCRIPTION
     _X_x_g_d_b is a graphical user  interface  to  the  _g_d_b  debugger
     under  the X Window System.  It provides visual feedback and
     mouse input  for  the  user  to  control  program  execution
     through  breakpoints,  to  examine and traverse the function
     call stack, to display values of variables and  data  struc-
     tures, and to browse source files and functions.

     _X_x_g_d_b  allows  initial  gdb  commands  stored  in  the  file
     ._g_d_b_i_n_i_t  to  be  executed  immediately  after  the symbolic
     information is read.  If ._g_d_b_i_n_i_t  does  not  exist  in  the
     current  directory,  the  user's  home directory is searched
     (~/._g_d_b_i_n_i_t). Option -nx can be used to prevent  xxgdb  from
     executing this file.

     _O_b_j_f_i_l_e is an object file produced by a  compiler  with  the
     appropriate  option  (-g)  specified to produce symbol table
     information for gdb.

     If a file named _c_o_r_e exists in the current  directory  or  a
     _c_o_r_e_f_i_l_e  is  specified,  _x_x_g_d_b  can  be used to examine the
     state of the program when the core dump occurred.

     The name of the debugger invoked by _x_x_g_d_b  is,  by  default,
     gdb,  but it can be overridden with the environment variable
     XXGDB_DEBUGGER or with the db_name option.

OPTIONS
     _X_x_g_d_b accepts all of the standard  X  Toolkit  command  line
     options  (see  _X(1)),  and all the gdb options (see _g_d_b(1)),
     plus the following xxgdb specific options:

     -db_name
          Specify the  name  of  the  debugger  to  override  the
          default "gdb"

     -db_prompt
          Specify to xxgdb  what  is  the  debugger  prompt.  The
          default  is  to expect the prompt to be the name of the
          debugger enclosed in parenthesis followed  by  a  space
          (eg, "(gdb) ").

     -nx  Do not execute .gdbinit file.

          Uses a 64x64 icon instead of the default 48x48 icon.

SUBWINDOWS
     _X_x_g_d_b consists of the following subwindows:

     File Window         Display the full pathname  of  the  file
                         displayed  in the source window, and the
                         line number of the caret.

     Source Window       Display the contents of a source file.

     Message Window      Display the execution status  and  error
                         messages of _x_x_g_d_b .

     Command Window      Provide a list of the  common  gdb  com-
                         mands which are invoked by simply click-
                         ing the LEFT mouse button.

     Dialogue Window     Provide a typing interface to gdb.

     Display Window      Provide a window  for  displaying  vari-
                         ables each time execution stops.

     Popup Windows       Provide windows for displaying variables
                         (see   "Displaying  C  Data  Structures"
                         below).

     The relative sizes of the source window, command window, and
     the  dialogue window can be adjusted by dragging the grip (a
     small square near the right edge  of  a  horizontal  border)
     with the LEFT mouse button down.

SELECTION
     Text selection in the source window is modified to  make  it
     easier  to  select  C  expressions.   LEFT mouse button down
     selects a C expression by highlighting it in  reverse-video.
     LEFT  mouse button down also positions the caret and updates
     the line label accordingly.

     C expression selection is based on the  resource  _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s
     which  determines  the  set  of characters that delimits a C
     expression.  (The default word  selection  behavior  in  the
     Athena  text  widget  selects  a  word  delimited  by  white
     spaces.)  Text selection adjustment is possible  by  holding
     the LEFT mouse button down and dragging.

     A LEFT mouse button click with the SHIFT button down  prints
     the value of the expression selected.

SCROLLBAR
     Pressing the LEFT mouse button  scrolls  the  text  forward,
     whereas  pressing  the  RIGHT  mouse button scrolls the text

     backward.  The amount of scrolling depends on  the  distance
     of  the  pointer  button away from the top of the scrollbar.
     If the button is pressed at the top of the  scrollbar,  only
     one  line  of text is scrolled.  If the button is pressed at
     the bottom of  the  scrollbar,  one  screenful  of  text  is
     scrolled.

     Pressing the MIDDLE mouse button changes the thumb  position
     of  the  scrollbar.   Dragging  the MIDDLE mouse button down
     moves the thumb along and changes the text displayed.

COMMAND BUTTONS
  Execution Commands
     run         Begin program execution.

     cont        Continue execution from where it stopped.

     next        Execute one source line, without  stepping  into
                 any function call.

     step        Execute one source line, stepping into  a  func-
                 tion  if  the  source  line  contains a function
                 call.

     finish      Continue execution until the selected  procedure
                 returns;  the  current procedure is used if none
                 is selected.


  Breakpoint Commands
     break     Stop program execution at the line or in the func-
               tion  selected.   To  set a breakpoint in the pro-
               gram, place the caret at the start of  the  source
               line  or  on the function name and click the break
               button.  A stop  sign  will  appear  next  to  the
               source line.

     tbreak    Set a breakpoint enabled only for one stop.   This
               is  the same as the break button except the break-
               point is automatically disabled the first time  it
               hit.

     delete    Remove the breakpoint on the source line  selected
               or the breakpoint number selected.

     show brkpts
               Show the  current  breakpoints  (both  active  and
               inactive).


  Stack Commands
     stack     Show a stack trace of the functions called.

     up        Move up one level on the call stack.

     down      Move down one level on the call stack.


  Data Display Commands
     print     Print the value of a  selected  expression.  (also
               see "Displaying C Data Structures" below)

     print *   Print the value of the object the selected expres-
               sion is pointing to.  (also see "Displaying C Data
               Structures" below)

     display   Display the value of a selected expression in  the
               display window, updating its value every time exe-
               cution stops.

     undisplay Stop displaying the value of the selected  expres-
               sion  in  the  display  window.   If  the selected
               expression is a constant, it refers to the display
               number   associated  with  an  expression  in  the
               display window.

     args      Print the arguments of the selected frame.

     show display
               Show the names of currently displayed expressions.
                    .IP "locals" Print the local variables of the
               selected frame.

     stack     Print a backtrace of the entire stack.


  Miscellaneous Commands
     search
          Pop up a search panel which allows  both  forward  (>>)
          and  reverse  (<<) search of text strings in the source
          file.   Hitting  carriage  return  after  entering  the
          search  string will begin a forward search and pop down
          the search panel.

     file Pop up a directory browser that allows the user to move
          up  and  down  in  the directory tree, to select a text
          file to be displayed, to select an executable  file  to
          debug,  or  to  select a core file to debug.  Directory
          entries are marked with a trailing slash (`/') and exe-
          cutables  with  a  trailing  asterisk (`*').  Filenames
          beginning with a dot (`.') or ending with a tilde (`~')
          are not listed in the menu.

     search
          Pop up a search panel which allows  both  forward  (>>)

          and  reverse  (<<) search of text strings in the source
          file.   Hitting  carriage  return  after  entering  the
          search  string will begin a forward search and pop down
          the search panel.

     yes  Send 'y' (yes) to gdb. To be used when gdb  requires  a
          yes/no response.

     no   Send 'n' (no) to gdb. To be used when  gdb  requires  a
          yes/no response.

     quit Exit _x_x_g_d_b.


  Displaying C Data Structures
     _X_x_g_d_b  provides  some  primitive  support  for   graphically
     displaying   C  structures  and  the  ability  of  following
     pointers.  Pressing the RIGHT mouse button on the print  (or
     print  *)  command button displays the value of the selected
     expression (or the value the selected expression is pointing
     to)  in  a  popup.  If the value is a pointer or a structure
     containing pointers, the user can examine the value  of  the
     object  that  pointer is pointing to by clicking the pointer
     value.  This will create another  popup  that  displays  the
     object  the  pointer  points  to.  Clicking the label of the
     popup pops down itself and all of its descendants.

X DEFAULTS
     To change the default values of  widget  resources  used  in
     _x_x_g_d_b,  you  need  to  reference  the  widgets by name or by
     class.  The widget hierarchies for the main window, the file
     menu, the search dialog box, and the popup data display used
     in xxgdb are shown as follows, with the name of  the  widget
     followed by the name of its class in parentheses:
