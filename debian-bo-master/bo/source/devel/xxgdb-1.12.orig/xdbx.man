.TH XDBX 1 "July 25 1990" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
xdbx \- X window system interface to the dbx debugger.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xdbx
[ \fI-toolkitoption ... \fP] [\fI-xdbxoption ... \fP] [\fI-dbxoption ... \fP] [\fIobjfile\fP 
[ \fIcorefile\fP ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIXdbx\fP is a graphical user interface to the \fIdbx\fP debugger under the
X Window System.  It provides visual feedback and mouse input for the
user to control program execution through breakpoints, to examine and
traverse the function call stack, to display values of
variables and data structures, and to browse source files and functions.
.LP
\fIXdbx\fP allows initial dbx commands stored in the file \fI.dbxinit\fP 
to be executed immediately after the symbolic information is 
read.  If \fI.dbxinit\fP does not exist in the current directory, the 
user's home directory is searched (\fI~/.dbxinit\fP).
.LP
\fIObjfile\fP is an object file produced by a compiler with the
appropriate option (-g) specified to produce symbol table
information for dbx.  For Sun dbx, if no \fIobjfile\fP is specified,
the \fBdebug\fP command can be used later to specify the program to be
debugged.
.LP
If a file named \fIcore\fP exists in the current directory or a
\fIcorefile\fP is specified, \fIxdbx\fP can be used to examine the
state of the program when the core dump occurred.
.LP
The name of the debugger invoked by \fIxdbx\fP is, by default, dbx, but
it can be overridden with the environment variable DEBUGGER.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIXdbx\fP accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options 
(see \fIX\fP(1)), and all the dbx options (see \fIdbx\fP(1)), plus
the following xdbx specific options:
.IP -bigicon
Uses a 64x64 icon instead of the default 48x48 icon.
.SH SUBWINDOWS
\fIXdbx\fP consists of the following subwindows:
.IP "File Window" 20
Display the full pathname of the file displayed in the source window,
and the line number of the caret.
.IP "Source Window" 20
Display the contents of a source file.
.IP "Message Window" 20
Display the execution status and error messages of \fIxdbx\fP .
.IP "Command Window" 20
Provide a list of the common dbx commands which are invoked by simply
clicking the LEFT mouse button.
.IP "Dialogue Window" 20
Provide a typing interface to dbx.
.IP "Display Window" 20
Provide a window for displaying variables each time execution stops.
(Sun dbx only)
.LP
The relative sizes of the source window, command window, and the dialogue
window can be adjusted by dragging the grip (a small square near the
right edge of a horizontal border) with the LEFT mouse button down.
.SH SELECTION
Text selection in the source window is modified to make it easier to
select C expressions.  LEFT mouse button down selects a C expression by
highlighting it in reverse-video.  LEFT mouse button down also positions the
caret and updates the line label accordingly.
.LP
C expression selection is based on the resource \fIdelimiters\fP which
determines the set of characters that delimits a C expression.  (The
default word selection behavior in the Athena text widget selects a
word delimited by white spaces.)  Text selection adjustment is possible
by holding the LEFT mouse button down and dragging.
.LP
A LEFT mouse button click with the SHIFT button down prints the value
of the expression selected.
.LP
.SH SCROLLBAR
Pressing the LEFT mouse button scrolls the text forward, whereas
pressing the RIGHT mouse button scrolls the text backward.  The amount
of scrolling depends on the distance of the pointer button away from
the top of the scrollbar.  If the button is pressed at the top of the
scrollbar, only one line of text is scrolled.  If the button is pressed
at the bottom of the scrollbar, one screenful of text is scrolled.
.LP
Pressing the MIDDLE mouse button changes the thumb position of the
scrollbar.  Dragging the MIDDLE mouse button down moves the thumb along
and changes the text displayed.
.SH COMMAND BUTTONS
.SS "Execution Commands"
.IP "\fBrun\fP" 12
Begin program execution.
.IP "\fBcont\fP"
Continue execution from where it stopped.
.IP "\fBstep\fP"
Execute one source line, stepping into a function if the source line
contains a function call.
.IP "\fBnext\fP"
Execute one source line, without stepping into any function call.
.IP "\fBreturn\fP"
(Berkeley dbx only) Continue execution until the selected procedure
returns; the current procedure is used if none is selected.

.LP
.SS "Breakpoint Commands"
.IP "\fBstop at\fP" 10
Stop program execution at the line selected.  To set a breakpoint in
the program, place the caret on the source line and click the \fBstop
at\fP button.  A stop sign will appear next to the source line.
.IP "\fBstop in\fP"
Stop program execution in the function selected.  To set a breakpoint
in a function, select the function name and click the \fBstop in\fP
button.  A stop sign will be placed near the first executable line of
the function.
.IP "\fBdelete\fP"
Remove the breakpoint on the source line selected or the breakpoint
number selected.
.IP "\fBstatus\fP"
Show the current breakpoints and traces.

.LP
.SS "Stack Commands"
.IP "\fBwhere\fP" 10
Show a stack trace of the functions called.
.IP "\fBup\fP"
Move up one level on the call stack.
.IP "\fBdown\fP"
Move down one level on the call stack.

.LP
.SS "Data Display Commands"
.IP "\fBprint\fP" 10
Print the value of a selected expression.
.IP "\fBprint *\fP"
Print the value of the object the selected expression is pointing to.
.IP "\fBdisplay\fP"
Display the value of a selected expression in the display window,
updating its value every time execution stops. (Sun dbx only)
.IP "\fBundisplay\fP"
Stop displaying the value of the selected expression in the display
window.  If the selected expression is a constant, it refers to the
display number associated with an expression in the display window.
(Sun dbx only)
.IP "\fBdump\fP"
Print the names and values of local variables and parameters in the
current or selected function.

.LP
.SS "Miscellaneous Commands"
.IP "\fBfunc\fP"
Display a selected function on the source window, and change the scope
for variable name resolution to the selected function.  The file scope
is changed to the file containing the function.
.IP "\fBfile\fP"
Pop up a directory browser that allows the user to move up and down
in the directory tree, to select a text file to be displayed, or (in
Sun dbx) to select an executable file to debug.  Directory entries are
marked with a trailing slash (`/') and executables with a trailing
asterisk (`*').  Filenames beginning with a dot (`.') or ending with a
tilde (`~') are not listed in the menu.
.IP "\fBsearch\fP"
Pop up a search panel which allows both forward (>>) and reverse (<<)
search of text strings in the source file.  Hitting carriage return
after entering the search string will begin a forward search and pop
down the search panel.
.IP "\fBquit\fP"
Exit \fIxdbx\fP.

.LP
.SS "Displaying C Data Structures (Sun dbx only)"
\fIXdbx\fP provides some primitive support for graphically displaying C
structures and the ability of following pointers.  Pressing the RIGHT
mouse button on the \fBprint\fP (or \fBprint *\fP) command button
displays the value of the selected expression (or the value the
selected expression is pointing to) in a popup.  If the value is a
pointer or a structure containing pointers, the user can examine the
value of the object that pointer is pointing to by clicking the pointer
value.  This will create another popup that displays the object the
pointer points to.  Clicking the label of the popup pops down itself
and all of its descendants.
.SH X DEFAULTS

.SH FILES
.nf
a.out 		default object file
core 		default core file
\&.dbxinit 		local initial commands file
~/.dbxinit 	user's initial commands file
.SH SEE ALSO
X(1), dbx(1)
.SH LIMITATIONS
Xdbx does not handle all the dbx commands properly.  Only a subset of
the commands is supported:
.nf

        run     stop at	   where   print   list   display     return
        cont    stop in	   up      dump    /      undisplay
        next    delete     down    func    ?
        step    status     use     file    quit

.SH BUGS
Sparc dbx does not always return correct source line position after
an up or down command.  Also, the file variable in sparc dbx sometimes
has an extra slash, as in /file.c, which could break what normally works.  
One way of getting around the latter is to specify the current directory
before the program name, as in 'xdbx ./a.out' or 'debug ./a.out'.
