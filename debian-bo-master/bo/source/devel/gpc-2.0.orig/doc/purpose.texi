@chapter The Purpose of GNU Pascal

@c Since nobody complained, I put in my new "purpose" section here.
@c -- PG, 2. Aug. 1996

The purpose of the GNU Pascal project is to produce a Pascal compiler
(called GNU Pascal or GPC) which

@itemize @bullet
@item
combines the clarity of Pascal with powerful tools suitable for real-life
programming,

@item
supports both the Pascal standard and the Extended Pascal standard as defined
by ISO, ANSI and IEEE. (ISO 7185:1990, ISO/IEC 10206:1991,
ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-1989)

@item
supports other Pascal standards (UCSD Pascal, Borland Pascal, Pascal-SC)
in so far as this serves the goal of clarity and usability,

@item
may be distributed under normal GNU license conditions

@item
can generate code and run on any computer for which the GNU C compiler can
generate code and run.

@end itemize

Pascal was originally designed for teaching.  GNU Pascal provides a 
smooth way to proceed to challenging programming tasks without learning 
a completely different language.

GNU Pascal compiler is part of the GNU Compiler family combining a language
independent part of the GNU Compiler with a Pascal specific front end.

Other compilers of the family currently include compilers for the C, C++
and Objective C languages.
