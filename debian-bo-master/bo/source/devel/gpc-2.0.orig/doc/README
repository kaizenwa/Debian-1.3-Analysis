This directory contains GNU Pascal's Texinfo documentation.
To read it on-line, type

    info --file gpc.info

from this directory.

If you prefer HTML documentation, get and install the `texi2html'
program (needs `perl') and type

    make html

and use your favorite HTML browser to read `gpc.html'.

You can run TeX to create a file `gpc.dvi' by typing

    make dvi
