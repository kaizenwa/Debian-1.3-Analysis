	Hi !
	
	Read this text after you have failed to install the best
	video game written for dec-20. If you have a better one, we are
	interested...
	
	The files necessary to construct/run/destruct ZAP (The Game, if you
	didn't notice...) are:
	
		ZAP.PAS		-- Pascal (PAX) source file.
		TERMCA.MAC	-- Terminal driver for various PAX programs
		HACMA.MAC	-- Macro utilities for ZAP. (The name?
				   Well, the first version of ZAP was
				   called HACK, but the name was changed
				   after hundreds of more and less magic
				   changes)
				   
	If you try to implement ZAP to another machine/with another
	compiler (& run time system), you need to rewrite/modify
	at least the terminal driver (you can write it in pascal, of course)
	and the module hacma. It will be hard, but you can forget
	most of the routines, only the saving and restoring would be
	nice to have.
	
	To run ZAP, you will perhaps want to modify the terminal driver
	to support the terminal type numbers in your system; that should
	be fairly easy, only change the numbers equated type numbers to those
	returned by Gttyp% system call.
	
	To load:
		COMPILE /lang:"/debug/ext" ZAP.PAS
		LOAD ZAP.REL,HACMA.MAC,TERMCA.MAC
		SAVE ZAP
		
	TERMCA.REL is also included in the library PaxLib:Librar/lib
	so load it with that if you have the library on disk.

	Make an empty score file to the SAME directory where ZAP.EXE
	is, named ZAP.Q8C. Get also the files ZAP.HELP & ZAP.NEWS to the
	same directory. (One fuction in HACMA is to check where ZAP
	is saved.) After that, you should be able to run it.
		
	To change terminal type while running ZAP; give the option command
	'o' and select 't'; so you get the list of supported terminals.
	(This is useful if you don't want to modify TERMCA.MAC).

	Ps. If you want to RESTORE a copied save file into ZAP, TAKE ZAP.CMD
	    otherwise it won't allow you to do this. (For wizards only).
