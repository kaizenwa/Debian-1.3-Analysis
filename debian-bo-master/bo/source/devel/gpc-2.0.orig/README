        The GNU Pascal Compiler (GPC) is part of the GNU compiler
        family, GNU CC or GCC.  Version 2.0 of GPC corresponds to
        GCC version 2.7.2.1.

        The file `FAQ' (Frequently Asked Questions) should answer most
        of the questions you might have about GNU Pascal.

        This is the source code distribution of GNU Pascal.  We prefer
        this form of distributing GNU Pascal because it gives you the
        possibility to customize, improve, and maintain the compiler by
        yourself (or to hire a programmer to do it for you).  However
        we provide binary distributions for some platforms at
        ftp://kampi.hut.fi/jtv/gnu-pascal/binary/.

        The most actual GNU Pascal version can always be found at
        ftp://kampi.hut.fi/jtv/gnu-pascal/.  See also our home page in
        the World Wide Web, http://home.pages.de/~GNU-Pascal/.

        See the file `INSTALL' for installation instructions.  (For the
        impatient: compile gcc, `configure', `make', `make install'. :)

        `NEWS' contains a list of changes with respect to the last
        official release, version 1.1 (corresponding to GCC 2.6.3).

        In the directory `doc' you can find the GNU Pascal documentation
        in GNU Texinfo format.  See `doc/README' for more about that.

        The directory `contrib' contains small demo programs contributed
        by volunteers.  (; Well, all of GPC is written by volunteers,
        but those programs are not part of GPC.)

        See the file `PROBLEMS' and the section "GPC Bugs" of the Info
        documentation to find out the major problems of the GPC version
        in this directory.

        The file `FPKvsGNU' contains a comparision between GNU Pascal
        and FPK Pascal, another 32-bit FreeWare Pascal compiler.  It was
        written by authors of both compilers in cooperation, so you can
        easier decide which one fits your needs better.

        `ChangeLog' contains an edit history.

        Everything else belongs to GNU Pascal's source code.

        Please send comments, suggestions, and bug reports to the GNU
        Pascal mailing list, gpc@hut.fi.  See the FAQ for details.

        Enjoy,
