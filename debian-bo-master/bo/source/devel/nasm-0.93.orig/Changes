Change log for NASM
===================

0.90 released October 1996
--------------------------

First release version. First support for object file output. Other
changes from previous version (0.3x) too numerous to document.

0.91 released November 1996
---------------------------

Loads of bug fixes.
Support for RDF added.
Support for DBG debugging format added.
Support for 32-bit extensions to Microsoft OBJ format added.
Revised for Borland C: some variable names changed, makefile added.
LCC support revised to actually work.
JMP/CALL NEAR/FAR notation added.
`a16', `o16', `a32' and `o32' prefixes added.
Range checking on short jumps implemented.
MMX instruction support added.
Negative floating point constant support added.
Memory handling improved to bypass 64K barrier under DOS.
$ prefix to force treatment of reserved words as identifiers added.
Default-size mechanism for object formats added.
Compile-time configurability added.
`#', `@', `~' and `?' are now valid characters in labels.
`-e' and `-k' options in NDISASM added.

0.92 released January 1997
--------------------------

The FDIVP/FDIVRP and FSUBP/FSUBRP pairs had been inverted: this was
fixed. This also affected the LCC driver.

Fixed a bug regarding 32-bit effective addresses of the form
[other_register+ESP].

Documentary changes, notably documentation of the fact that Borland
Win32 compilers use `obj' rather than `win32' object format.

Fixed the COMENT record in OBJ files, which was formatted
incorrectly.

Fixed a bug causing segfaults in large RDF files.

OBJ format now strips initial periods from segment and group
definitions, in order to avoid complications with the local label
syntax.

Fixed a bug in disassembling far calls and jumps in NDISASM.

Added support for user-defined sections in COFF and ELF files.

Compiled the DOS binaries with a sensible amount of stack, to
prevent stack overflows on any arithmetic expression containing
parentheses.

Fixed a bug in handling of files that do not terminate in a newline.

0.93 released January 1997
--------------------------

This release went out in a great hurry after semi-crippling bugs
were found in 0.92.

Really _did_ fix the stack overflows this time. *blush*

Had problems with EA instruction sizes changing between passes, when
an offset contained a forward reference and so 4 bytes were
allocated for the offset in pass one; by pass two the symbol had
been defined and happened to be a small absolute value, so only 1
byte got allocated, causing instruction size mismatch between passes
and hence incorrect address calculations. Fixed.

Stupid bug in the revised ELF section generation fixed (associated
string-table section for .symtab was hard-coded as 7, even when this
didn't fit with the real section table). Was causing `ld' to
seg-fault under Linux.

Included a new Borland C makefile, Makefile.bc2, donated by Fox
Cutter <lmb@comtch.iea.com>.
