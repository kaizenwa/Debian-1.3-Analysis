.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 7
UPLO   - CHARACTER*1
On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as
follows:

UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of A
is to be referenced.

UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of A
is to be referenced.

Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
N      - INTEGER
On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
N must be at least zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
ALPHA  - COMPLEX*16
On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
A      - COMPLEX*16 array, dimension ( LDA, N )
Before entry, with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
triangular part of the symmetric matrix and the strictly
lower triangular part of A is not referenced.
Before entry, with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
triangular part of the symmetric matrix and the strictly
upper triangular part of A is not referenced.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
LDA    - INTEGER
On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
max( 1, N ).
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
X      - COMPLEX*16 array, dimension at least
( 1 + ( N - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the N-
element vector x.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
INCX   - INTEGER
On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
X. INCX must not be zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
BETA   - COMPLEX*16
On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta. When BETA is
supplied as zero then Y need not be set on input.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
Y      - COMPLEX*16 array, dimension at least
( 1 + ( N - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ).
Before entry, the incremented array Y must contain the n
element vector y. On exit, Y is overwritten by the updated
vector y.
.TP 7
INCY   - INTEGER
On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of
Y. INCY must not be zero.
Unchanged on exit.
