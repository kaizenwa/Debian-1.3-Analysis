To install the LAPACK documentation, do the following:

NOTE:  You can follow the same directions to install the BLAS manpages.
       Just copy from blas/man/manl/ instead of man/manl/.

1) Copy the LAPACK manual pages to the desired location.  This
   will probably be /usr/local/man/manl or other.dir/man/manl.

   % cp man/manl/* /usr/local/man/manl

   Be aware that if the manpages are installed in some directory
   other than /usr/local/man/manl you will need to add that directory
   to your MANPATH environment variable.  First type:

   % echo $MANPATH
   
   If it says that MANPATH is undefined, type:

   % setenv MANPATH /usr/man:/usr/local/man:/user_path/man_dir

   Otherwise, if MANPATH is defined, type:

   % setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:/user_path/man_dir

   where man_dir is the directory of manual pages containing /man/manl.

   ('%' is assumed to be your shell prompt.)

2) Add the LAPACK manual pages to the whatis database for keyword
   searching via 'man -k':

   % catman -w -M /usr/local/man 

   or

   % catman -w -M other.dir/man

3) Compile the LAPACK equivalence utility and copy the executable
   to the appropriate directory. 

   % cc -o equivalence equivalence.c

   % cp equivalence /usr/local/bin

   (or copy it somewhere in your path.)

4) Test out the installation.  First make sure your current shell
   knows about the installation:

   % rehash

   Now test out the manual pages:

   % man dgetrf

   You should get the man page for dgetrf.  BE AWARE that your request
   should be in lower case.

   Now test the LAPACK equivalence utility:

   % equivalence <linpack-routine>
   or
   % equivalence <eispack-routine>

   For example,

   % equivalence spbco rsp

   You should get the output:


SPBCO:	REAL FUNCTION SLANSB( NORM, UPLO, N, K, AB, LDAB, WORK )
	REAL FUNCTION DLANSB( NORM, UPLO, N, K, AB, LDAB, WORK )

	SUBROUTINE SPBTRF( UPLO, N, KD, AB, LDAB, INFO )
	SUBROUTINE DPBTRF( UPLO, N, KD, AB, LDAB, INFO )

	SUBROUTINE SPBCON( UPLO, N, KD, AB, LDAB, ANORM, RCOND, WORK, IWORK, INFO )
	SUBROUTINE DPBCON( UPLO, N, KD, AB, LDAB, ANORM, RCOND, WORK, IWORK, INFO )

RSP:	SUBROUTINE SSPEV( JOBZ, UPLO, N, AP, W, Z, LDZ, WORK, INFO )
	SUBROUTINE DSPEV( JOBZ, UPLO, N, AP, W, Z, LDZ, WORK, INFO )

   where the item to the left of the colon is the LINPACK or EISPACK
   routine to which you would like to know if there is an LAPACK equivalent.
   The item to the right of the colon is the associated LAPACK routine
   and calling sequence.

If you have any comments/suggestions, please direct them to lapack@cs.utk.edu.
