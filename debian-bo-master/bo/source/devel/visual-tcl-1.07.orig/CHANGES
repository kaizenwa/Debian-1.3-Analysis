ChangeLog for Visual Tcl:

1.06 -> 1.07 (January 9, 1997)
    o Moved toolbar outside of main application window. Simplified lib_core.

    o Remade some system compounds using grid instead of pack
    o Enabled editing of pre/post commands for window pre/post setup
    o Added support for embedded functions in compounds
    o Added preliminary support for exporting tclets
    o Changed globals to support only explicitly added vars

        thanks to "Visser, Martin MC" <Visser.Martin.MC@bhp.com.au>
    o Enabled loading of project files from command-line

        thanks to Frank Scholz <dev@artus.pf.bawue.de>
    o Fixed bug when running without attribute editor

        This is the same as <Button-2> on unix for folks without three
        buttons. It's primary use is moving compounds whose parent container
        are mostly obscured.
    o Many changes inspired by a patch from Robin Becker
        Closing unsaved application now has: "Yes No Cancel"
        Widget bindings for those without a middle button

    o Added ability to edit multiple commands simultaneously
    o Fixed widget geometry size bug introduced in 1.04
