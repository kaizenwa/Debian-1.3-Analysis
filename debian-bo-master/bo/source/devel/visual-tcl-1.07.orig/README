Visual TCL - A cross-platform application development environment
Copyright (C) 1996,1997 Stewart Allen

Overview
--------

 Visual Tcl is a freely-available, high-quality application development
 environment for UNIX, Windows and Macintosh platforms. Written entirely
 in Tcl and generating pure Tcl should make porting either unnecessary or
 trivial. Visual Tcl is covered by the GNU General Public License insuring
 that it will remain in the capable hands of the internet community. Please
 read the LICENSE file for more information.


Installation
------------

 ALL:

    1. Unzip or untar Visual Tcl into a permanent location. On Unix, I
       recommend /usr/local/vtcl or /usr/vtcl. On Windows, a good default
       is "C:\Program Files\Visual Tcl"


 UNIX:

    2. edit "vt" shell script
       Change PATH_TO_WISH to the location of the wish binary
       Change VTCL_HOME to the directory from step 1.

    3. Put vt in your path (/usr/local/bin or /usr/bin) or change your
       path to include ${VTCL_HOME)

    4. Make sure your display is set and type "vt".


 WINDOWS 95:

    2. edit "autoexec.bat" and add:
       VTCL_HOME=(location_from_step_1)

    3. You will need to associate all ".tcl" files with the Wish appplication.
       You can then create an icon short-cut to "vt.tcl" NOT "vt" which is a
       shell script for unix.

    4. Reboot to make path change from Step 2 effective.
       Double-click on "vt.tcl" icon.


 WINDOWS NT:

    2. Add VTCL_HOME to the system environment variables and set it's
       value to the location from step 1.

    3. You will need to associate all ".tcl" files with the Wish appplication.
       You can then create an icon short-cut to "vt.tcl" NOT "vt" which is a
       shell script for unix.

    4. Double-click on "vt.tcl" icon.


 MACINTOSH:

    2. Once you've decompressed and unarchived it, your done. Just
       double-click on the appropriate "Visual Tcl" icon. There is
       one for 68K Macs and one for PowerPC Macs.


 Please provide updates to this document as you discover errors or
 omissions. I haven't had a chance to perform installations on all
 system types.

 Enjoy!
