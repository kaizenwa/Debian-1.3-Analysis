- create procedure libraries - add category field in proc list.
- more modularization: functions, variables, commands. will help w/...
- add "user applications" link page to web site
- add tix widget support & icon bar
- add a font chooser (platform specific?)
- create per-widget-type "properties" boxes
- add "application options" window (like window class)
- limit undo/redo depth (memory pig). add more granularity
- rename and wrap source and proc
- work on incremental saves and multi-file projects

BUGS

- exporting tclets screws up widget aliases (but the app exports ok)
- improperly filters "tcl*" procedures - more explicit list required
- bind editor is incomplete
- setting an alias to blank doesn't delete the alias (and rev)
- toplevel geometry editor incomplete: grid, aspect, init geom, protocols, etc.
- undo/redo only updated between deselects/reselects
- undo/redo broken for compounds

TCL8.x BUGS & INCOMPATABILITIES

- grid column/row configure -width doesn't support floats
- grid column/row configure is broken for the last row/col
