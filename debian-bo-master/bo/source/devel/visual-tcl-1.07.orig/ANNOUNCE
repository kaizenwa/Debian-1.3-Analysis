 Visual Tcl 1.07b
 January 9, 1997

 Announcing the seventh beta release of Visual Tcl, a freely-available, high-
 quality application development environment for UNIX, Windows and Macintosh
 platforms. Visual Tcl is written entirely in Tcl/Tk and covered by the GNU
 General Public License.

 This is a *major* point release with a lot of new functionality and bug
 fixes. You will notice immediately that the interface has changed slightly.
 A new floating toolbar holds widget icons and the main application bar now
 allows changing of frequently use attributes. This new layout and the new
 widget abstraction code will make it a lot easier to plug in new widgets.

 Another exciting new feature is the ability to generate Tclets which
 can run in Netscape and Microsoft Explorer (if you have the TclPlugin).
 It's as simple as selecting a Toplevel window then use the menu command
 Compound->Save as Tclet. Tclets run in a single window so the selected
 toplevel and any procedures and globals will be grabbed. Tclet generation
 involves the creation of a compound which means all of your widgets will
 be renamed. This means you _must_ use widget aliases instead of their
 explicit name when accessing them. The examples that usually come with
 Visual Tcl have been converted to Tclets. Tclets can also run standalone
 or in a browser. To run a Tclet standalone, though, you must use the
 new Tk8.0a.

 Compound widgets now support embedded procedures. When you create a
 compound, all procedures that begin with "<compound_name>:" will be
 bundled. For example, if you create a compound "Fred", then procedures
 like "Fred:do_this" and "Fred:do_that" will be included.

 The way widgets are saved hs changed; now all widgets are defined before
 being packed, placed or gridded. Previously widgets were inserted right
 after creation. This change will not affect old Visual Tcl projects. They
 will be updated the next time you open/save them. I will add code in the
 next release that allows you to insert custom code into the toplevel window
 creation procedure.

 Some other nicities:
    - you can switch modes by clicking on the mode label
    - native file and color browsers now used under Tk4.2
    - there is a new preference for default geometry manager
    - there is a new menu item: File->Source.
    - you can now load projects from the command line: vt <filename>
    - all application window locations are now saved
    - check out the demo directory for new goodies
