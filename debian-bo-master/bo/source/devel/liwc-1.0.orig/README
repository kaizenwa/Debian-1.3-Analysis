This is ccmtcnvt, version 1.1.

ccmtcnvt converts C++ comments (// foo) to C comments (/* foo */).
Please see ccmtcnvt.1 (the manual page) and the top of the ccmtcnvt.c for
details.

You need my Publib library and a <unistd.h> that declares getopt
to build. Once you have these (or hack the source to avoid them),
you can compile with "make" and install with "make install".

Please send all bug reports by electronic mail to:
    liw@iki.fi

ccmtcnvt is free software.  You may copy it according to the
GNU General Public License, version 2. A copy of the license
is not included, but you can get one from most FTP sites that
have GNU software, for example, prep.ai.mit.edu.
