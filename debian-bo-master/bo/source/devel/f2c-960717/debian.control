Description: A Fortran77 to C/C++ translator, plus static & shared libs.
 f2c translates Fortran77 (with some extensions) into C, so that it can
 then be compiled and run on a system with no Fortran compiler.  The C
 files must then be linked against the appropriate libraries.
 .
 Currently this is more stable than g77, and is the recommended way
 to compile Fortran as black box routines.  However source level
 debugging facilities are not available.
Maintainer: Alan Bain <afrb2@master.debian.org>
Depends: libc5

Suggests: fort77
