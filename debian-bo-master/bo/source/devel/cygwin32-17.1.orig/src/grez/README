This is a portable version of Apple's Rez resource compiler for Macs.
It takes in resource definitions and resource type definitions and
puts out the resources in a binary format.  When running on a Mac,
the output is directly into the resource fork of the output file;
on any other machine, the output just goes into a file currently
(eventually users will be able to choose formats such as MacBinary
or AppleDouble).

The source language is as defined by Apple in the MPW manuals.  Not
all constructs generate correct output, but the parser appears to be
complete (it can parse everything in the "RIncludes" directory).
