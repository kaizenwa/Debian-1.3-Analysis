This file documents the process for making a Cygnus progressive-style
release.  Right now it is only possible to make a 'comp-tools' or an
'emacs' release.  The Install script needs to be hacked to make any
additional type of release.  

Release notes and install notes also need to be worked on in order to
support any other bundle.  If you are not a member of the progressive
release team making a progressive release, the installation notes and the
release notes are probably not appropriate for you, especially the release
notes.  You'll need to provide your own release notes.  If you wish them to
be a part of the CVS repository, you need to do this yourself.  

Once you have a working set of sources, tag those sources, and fill in the
appropriate fields in $TREE/release-info.  The main fields you're likely to
change are RELEASE_DATE, BUNDLE, and (if you are not making an official
progressive release) RELEASE_VAULT.

Build your tree.  This should include the 'release' directory, and it
should have the appropriate tools built in there as a part of the build
process.

Run 'make source-vault' from the top level of an object directory
(e.g., cd sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1-objdir.3; make source-vault) in order
to create the first part of a release, the source tree.  This will
check out a new copy of the tree, and clean it up for release.  This
will take a chunk of time.

    Checking out a new copy instead of copying the current tree is NOT an
    accident, and it is NOT a bug.  It forces you to have all of the software
    checked into CVS, and tagged as well.  This is a good thing.  Really.

The run 'make vault-install' from the top-level of the object directory

Once this is done, run 'make binary-vault' to finish up the rest of
the process (making the Install script, building installation notes,
cleaning up the binary tree).

Once you've done this, the various Pack-* scripts in $objdir/release are
suitable for making a tape.
