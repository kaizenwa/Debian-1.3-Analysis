Fri Feb 10 09:55:35 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* Build-A-Release-in: Don't be nice when compressing tarballs.
	  ($(reldir)/.$(tree)-clean): a more complicated symbolic mode
	  allows us to use one recursive chmod instead of three.

Thu Feb  9 14:11:31 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* Build-A-Release-in ($(gendir)/install.texi): removed target, the
	  install documents are no longer generated on a per-target basis.
	  (generated-files): don't depend on $(gendir)/install.texi.

Fri Feb  3 11:56:36 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* README: describe new toplevel makefile targets.

Thu Jan 19 16:54:42 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* Pack-A-Progressive-in: get Install from ${RELDIR}/${target}, and
	  make sure that it is there before starting to write tape.

Wed Jan 18 14:39:58 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* Build-A-Release-in: build compressed tar file for source-vault
	  target.

Mon Jan 16 11:13:50 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (GENFILE): Added $(srcdir)/subst-relinfo and

Wed Dec 14 16:24:57 1994  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* Pack-A-Progressive-in: Use conv=sync when dd'ing out tapes.
	* Pack-DAT-in: likewise.
	* Pack-src: likewise.

Mon Sep 26 15:28:35 1994  J.T. Conklin  (jtc@rtl.cygnus.com)
	
	* Build-A-Release-in: Add h flag to tar so that symlinks are
	  followed.

	* blockit.c: Removed.

	* Build-A-Release-in: The source-vault target creates a compressed
	  tar images of sources and executables.  These are used by
	  Pack-A-Progressive and Pack-DAT when writing tapes.

	* Pack-A-Progressive-in: Now writes three hunks to a tape: the
	  Install script, the executables, and the sources.  Output is
	  written with `dd ... of=${tape} obs=${BLOCKSIZE}' instead of
	  with the blockit program.  Dumps compressed tar files to tape
	  for executable and source hunks.
	* Pack-DAT-in: Likewise.

	mostlyclean.  Remove Makefile and config.status.

	* PE-in: removed.   PP works just fine.

	* Pack-Exa: added.

	* Pack-src: added.

	* Pack-DAT-in:

Thu Apr 14 09:58:14 1994  Jason Molenda  (crash@sendai.cygnus.com)

	  macro.  At some times, we use a different command to clean up a
	  source tree.

	* vault-install-in: add -w to the make line.
