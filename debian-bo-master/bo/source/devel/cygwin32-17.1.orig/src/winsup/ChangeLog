Tue Jun 11 09:50:09 1996  Jason Molenda  (crash@kyriath.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: changed $(DOC) so it doesn't include html
	files; made a new info-html target that does the html
	versions of the docs.  Since most customers don't have texi2html

	of sizeof (buf).

	DLL and APP are out of sync.

Thu May 16 03:07:18 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* fhandler.cc (FakeReadFile): new function. Interface like
	ReadFile, only called from fhandler_console_in::read, calls
	ReadFile unless we're really reading from STD_INPUT_HANDLE and
	with ENABLE_LINE_INPUT turned off, in which case we use
	ReadConsoleInput instead. When using ReadConsoleInput, always read
	all available events, but only block if we don't get at least one
	actual character. This would be the place to implement FIONBIO on
	the console tty, which doesn't actually exist yet.
	(dbg_input_event): copied from select.cc, debugging code to show
	detail of what events we're actually getting.
	(ioctl): off-by-one on window size.

Wed May 15 18:11:16 1996  Jim Wilson  <wilson@chestnut.cygnus.com>

	* pproc.cc (per_process::init): Move strace initialization from here,
	* strace.cc (per_process::strace_init): To here.
	Pass FILE_SHARE_WRITE to CreateFileA.  Print error message if open
	of log file fails.  Create mutex for trace messages.
	(__sys_printf): Always write to end of disk files.  Use mutex.
	(d): Delete.
	* winsup.h (class per_process): Add strace_init.  Reorganize.
	`run_ctors' renamed to `run_ctors_p'.  New member `trace_mutex'.
	(d): Delete.
	(PATH_MAX): Delete.

	* Makefile.in: Add header file dependencies.

	* dcrt0.cc (_exit): Add debugging printf.
	* shared.h (class shared_info): Rename member mutex_a to fork_mutex.
	* fork.cc (cygwin_fork_helper1): Update.
	Return with error if process slot unavailable.
	Set errno and release fork_mutex if failed because of split heap.
	* shared.cc (shared_info::terminate): Update.
	(shared_info::initialize): Update.

Tue May 14 14:59:32 1996  Doug Evans  <dje@canuck.cygnus.com>

	* fork.cc (cygwin_fork_helper1): Avoid SIGSEGV if allocate_pid fails.

	* pproc.cc (per_process::init): Fix test.

	* winsup.h (): Rename member `parent' to `ppid'.

	(hinfo_vec::dup_for_fork): Fix message.
	(hinfo_vec::dup2): Fix args to debug_printf.  Delete extra printf's.
	* pinfo.cc (pinfo_init_per_process): Update.
	(pinfo::dump): Likewise.
	(pinfo::init_self): Likewise.
	* pproc.cc (per_process::init): Open strace file in append mode.
	* smallprintf.c (__small_vsprintf): Support %p.
	* syscalls.cc (getppid): Update.
	* wait.cc (wait_for_any): Likewise.
	
Mon May 13 13:45:36 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* fhandler.cc (ioctl): fix TIOCGWINSZ handling: (1) check the
	error return (2) if we're trying on STD_INPUT_HANDLE, substitute
	STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE since GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo only works on
	console output (3) check srWindow for the *screen* size, instead
	of checking dwSize for the scroll buffer size.

	* include/sys/errno.h (ECONNABORTED): add another errno value.
	* net.cc (errmap): add ECONNABORTED case.

	* fhandler.cc (fstat): clear the *entire* stat buf, not just the
	first four bytes.

Fri May 10 17:59:09 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* select.cc: change most debugging statements to select_printf.
 	(dbg_input_event): new function, prints an INPUT_RECORD via select
 	printf.
	(polled): Don't sleep around WaitForMultipleObjects; let it have a
 	10ms timeout until we have time to test it with 0.  If
 	WaitForMultipleObjects says that STD_INPUT_HANDLE has data, use
 	PeekConsoleInput to scan the available events. If the first one is
 	not a *bKeyDown* with a non-zero *AsciiChar* then use
 	ReadConsoleInput to rip it off the queue, and pretend it wasn't
 	there, so that later calls to read (and thus ReadFile) don't block
 	because they can't find any *real* input. (This could be optimized
	later to check the whole queue, and if there are *no* real input
	events, nuke them all.)

	* include/sys/strace.h (_STRACE_SELECT, select_printf): new printf
	category, because select needs a *lot* of work. STRACE=256 to use it.

	* fhandler.cc (fhandler_console_in::init): IGNCR can't work
 	without major changes to deal with the interaction with select
 	(which shouldn't wake up if IGNCR causes the whole input to be
 	deleted...) so don't make it the default.
	(fhandler_console_out::tcgetattr, fhandler_tty::tcgetattr): don't
 	set IGNCR based on get_r_binary either.

Wed May  8 20:20:05 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* times.cc (__to_clock_t): must cast dwLowDateTime to *unsigned*
	before adding it -- otherwise we may subtract it!
	(to_time_t): same.

Wed May  8 18:21:28 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* times.cc (corelocaltime): new function. Basic localtime from
	newlib, with no conversions.
	(gmtime): just calls corelocaltime.
	(localtime): uses GetTimeZoneInformation, biases to standard time
	first, then uses DaylightDate and StandardDate to figure out if
	we're in DST -- and calls corelocaltime a second time with the
	rebiased seconds, if we are.
	(times): add debug_printf statements which work around apparent
	compiler bug and 7+ minute error.

	* select.cc: revert to <sac>'s changes of 4/20 which were
	accidentally backed out on 4/24.

Tue May  7 05:29:42 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* times.cc (__to_clock_t): subtract out FACTOR, the difference
	between 1601 and 1970, just like to_time_t() does.

Tue May  7 01:55:06 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* times.cc (gmtime): new function. Use GetTimeZoneInformation to
	compensate ahead before calling localtime (since the newlib
	version doesn't know what timezone we're in.)
	(localtime): use SECSPERMIN, not 60, to show that we know what
	we're talking about.

	* net.cc (errmap): add WSAEADDRINUSE, WSAECONNREFUSED mappings.

Sun May  5 00:45:59 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* include/sys/socket.h: add recvfrom macro and cygwin32_recvfrom
	declaration. Remove htons/htonl misdeclarations as they collide
	with the macros in asm/byteorder.h.

	* include/asm/byteorder.h: enable the ntohl/ntohs declarations so
	we at least get the macro versions when we optimize, even if the
	library hooks aren't there.

Wed Apr 24 23:42:49 1996  Steve Chamberlain  <sac@dilithium.transmeta.com>

	* winsup.h (pinfo, pinfo_list): Remove dummy item.

	* exceptions.cc (i386 call_handler): optimize.
	* fhandler.cc (fhandler_console_in::read): Handle ICRNL right.
	(*:get_name *:always_ready): New.
	* select.cc: Understand that console output doesn't signal when it's
	ready.

Fri Apr 12 14:49:34 1996  Doug Evans  <dje@canuck.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (glob/libglob.a): Pass -I so glob.c finds right dirent.h.

	* Makefile.in (glob/libglob.a): Call glob makefile correctly.
	* winsup.h (pinfo, pinfo_list): Reorder elements to avoid
	alignment bug in PPC gcc.

	* dcrt0.cc (globify): Expand command line wildcards if
	run from dos prompt.

	* exceptions.cc (386 call_handler): More fumblings.
	* fhandler.cc (fhandler_base::stat): Initialize ino.
	(fhandler_console::open): Fix test for RDONLY.
	(fhandler_tty::stat): Set ino.
	(fhandler_console_out::vt100 stuff): More.
	* fork.cc: Lint.
	* pinfo.cc (pinfo::init_self): Don't bother to DuplicateHandles
	to get process info.
	* signal.cc (usleep): Get correct order of magnitude.
	* spawn.cc (spawn_guts): Turn of exception handling in 
	parent of thing which execs.
	* syscalls.cc (stat): Look for <file> and <file.exe>.

	returns invalid result.
