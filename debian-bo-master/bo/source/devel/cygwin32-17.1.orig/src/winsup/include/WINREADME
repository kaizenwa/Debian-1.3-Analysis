Writing these headers is a real pain.

I don't understand Microsoft's header file philosophy, so I've
invented my own.

Each DLL has a header file which declares prototypes for the entry
points.

Eg, kernel32.dll has winkernel.h.  Since there's way too many to do in
one go, I'm doing them as I need them.  When they get done, the word
"DONE" is added to the list of exports at the head of the file.

windows.h includes all the different sub .h files, so normal operation
won't be affected.

Types (and constants) will be declared as close to where they are
needed as possible - eg, if only the .h file which declares the protos
needs them, then they'll be in that header.  If more than one .h file
(and thus more than one .dll) needs the type, the type will move into
wintypes.h.  

Not all of this is true yet, it will be soon.
