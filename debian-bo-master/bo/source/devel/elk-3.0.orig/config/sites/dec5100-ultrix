# This is a shell script.  It is sourced by the build scripts in the
# various subdirectories to gather site- and installation-specific
# information required for building the Makefiles.
#
# This script is read after the "system" file, therefore you can place
# variable settings here to override those from "system".
#
# Some variables in this script are interpreted as boolean variables and
# indicate presence or absence of one specific feature.  The value "yes"
# is regarded as "true", all other values (including no value or even
# non-existence of the variable) are interpreted as "false".
#
# Do not forget to quote values that contain shell meta syntax.
