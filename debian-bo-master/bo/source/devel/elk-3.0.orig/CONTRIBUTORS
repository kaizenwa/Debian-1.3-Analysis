Numerous users of the Extension Language Kit (too many to mention them
all) have contributed ideas, suggestions for improvements, bug reports,
source code, useful feedback, as well as other kinds of support to this
and earlier releases.  Their help has made the present version of Elk
Extension Language Kit a genuinely collective effort.

I'm especially obliged to my former colleague Carsten Bormann, who
has significantly influenced the design of Elk since the beginning
of the project in 1987.  Carsten also wrote most of the bignum code.

I also would like to thank Claus Bathe of NME Berlin for securing the
permission from his management to publish Elk 1.2 (from which the
present version has been derived), and Prof. Dr. Sigram Schindler for
providing the work environment for my research work at Technische
Universitaet Berlin.

In addition, I would like to thank Nick Betteridge, Stephen Bevan,
Alan Bishop, Tim Bradshaw, Paul Breslaw, Dennis Brueni, Thomas Dickey,
Ted Dunning, Gerhard Eckel, Walter Eder, Joe Esch, Mikel Evins,
Ed Ferguson, Ram Firestone, Robert Forsman, Ken Fox, Thomas Gellekum,
Robert Glickstein, George Hartzell, Robert Henry, Don Hopkins,
Xiaoli Huang, Bill Janssen, Rob Jellinghaus, Robert Joop, Kazuhiko Kato,
Doo-Hwan Kim, Bengt Kleberg, Richard Kreutzer, Richard Kuhns, Dinh Le,
John Lewis, Tor Lillqvist, Christopher Maeda, Steven Majewski,
Craig McPheeters, Zdzislaw Meglicki, Perry Metzger, Lars Nyman,
Richard O'Keefe, Bob Pendelton, Flip Phillips, Norbert Preining,
Dave Richards, Robert Sanders, Supreet Singh, Martin Stut, Brian Taylor,
Scott Watson, and Mike Wray.  I apologize for any omissions from
this--necessarily incomplete--list.
