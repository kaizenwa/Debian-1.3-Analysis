          +-- MIGRATE     Explains how C/C++ code (applications or extensions)
	  |               written for older versions of Elk may have to be

	  |               installing Elk; a brief description of the files that
	  |               get installed in the process; and a description of
	  |               the structure of the Makefiles and the purpose of

          |
          +-- MACHINES    Additional, platform-specific advice for installing
	  |               and using Elk, such as compiler bugs, unsupported
	  |               features, problems with older OS versions and other
	  |               pitfalls

          |
          +-- config/     Holds the configuration files with machine- and
	  |               site-specific information required for building
	  |               Elk.  See INSTALL for details.
          |
          +-- include/    The include files to be #included by applications
	  |               that use Elk as their extension language, and by
	  |               extensions to Elk.  Including scheme.h from this
	  |               directory causes all the other .h files to be
	  |               included in the right order.  The include files may
	  |               or may not use ANSI/ISO-C prototypes, depending on
	  |               the config file you have chosen.
          |
          +-- scripts/    Shell scripts to link the Scheme interpreter with
	  |               extensions (useful on platforms that to not support
	  |               dynamic loading of objects), and to create
	  |               dynamically loadable objects from .o files.  See
	  |               INSTALL and scripts/README for details.
          |

          |
          +-- scm/        Scheme files that are loaded during runtime.  These
	  |               are copied to a destination directory specified in
	  |               config/site when Elk is installed.
          |
          +-- lib --,     This directory tree holds the C source for various
	  |         |     Elk extensions that can be loaded into the Scheme
	  |         |     interpreter or linked with an application
	  |         |

          |         +-- xaw/   The Scheme interfaces to the X11 Athena widgets.
	  |         |          There is one .d file for each widget class.
	  |         |          Each of these is compiled into a C source file
	  |         |          when running `make' and then compiled into a
	  |         |          dynamically loadable object.
          |         |
          |         +-- xm/    The .d files for the Motif widgets
          |         |

	  |                    loadable Elk extensions
          |
	  +-- doc/        The directory tree holding the documentation for
	  |               Elk as troff input files and pre-generated

	  |               of the `doc' tree.
	  |
	  |
	  +-- examples --,   A collection of demonstration programs for Elk
	  |              |   and the various extensions (mostly in Scheme)
	  |              |
	  |              +-- scheme  Basic Scheme demos (collected from USENET
	  |              |           and other sources)

	  `-- util/       Various utilities, some of which may aid in preparing
