"timeit" performs timing tests between a server and a client, both
implemented in ANSI C.  The client performs 3 tests, a cardinal ping,
a real ping, and a 10-char string ping (where ping means sending a
value and receiving that value back again).

To build and run, use the following commands:

% ilumkmf
% make timeit-server timeit-client

% ./timeit-server
exported ilu:TimingTest.augustus.parc.xerox.com/0;ilu%3Ac0FGHuC8UdTAO+ETWz1Nl5RjWa3;sunrpc_2_0x61a78_1139713249@sunrpcrm=tcp_13.2.116.14_2283

% ./timeit-client 1 10 100
test "cardinal (C unsigned long)", outerCount 10, innerCount 100:
   category:    min /    avg +-  stdev /    max milliseconds/call

% ./timeit-client 2 10 100
