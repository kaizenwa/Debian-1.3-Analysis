The 3 programs in "httest" are used to test and demonstrate the use of 
the HTTP protocol within ILU.  They show ILU communicating with an
existing Web server, an existing Browser communicating with ILU, and 
ILU communicating with ILU over HTTP.


htserver overview
-----------------

	This server program creates 2 objects;

	An instance of the http_Resource Object type, (as defined in http.isl) 
		with object id /http_obj0 .  This object has implementations of the
		GET HEAD and POST methods, that simply return an entity body describing
		the name of the method that was called.

	An instance of the httest_DerivedResource Object type, (as defined in httest.isl)
		with object id /httpderived_obj0 . This object has implementations of the
		GET HEAD and POST methods, that simply return an entity body describing
		the name of the method that was called.  It also has a 'flipcase' method
		that accepts a string as an argument, flips the case of each character
		in the string, and returns that 'flipped' string back as its return 
		value. However, if the string is 'raiseerror' the flipcase method takes
		this as an indication that the caller wants an condition to be raised
		(hey, it's a test program OK !-), and responds by raising an exception.

	Each object is serviced by it's own ilu server (though that's just how
	it was written) and each object is also Published.

	Usage:  htserver [port_number [ HOSTNAME [verbose] ] ]

        port_number - tcp port the base_server should use - default 80
		Note that on Unix systems you'll need to be root in order to
		put something at a port as low as 80.  

        HOSTNAME - used as part of the id for the server
        of the httest_DerivedResource - defaults to this host.

        verbose - if anthing there as 3nd arg, the program
        outputs information about what's going on.


htclient overview
-----------------

	The client program accepts a URL as it's first argument.  This is
	treated as an identifier for a http_Resource object (which may reside
	in side an existing Web server).  GET HEAD and POST calls are made
	on this object and the results displayed.  (If the URL is literally
	NIL, then this test is skipped.)

	If the second argument is provided, then htclient assumes that is should
	call the GET HEAD and POST methods on the httpderived_obj0 implemented
	by htserver, as well as call its flipcase method using the argument as
	the argument to the method. Results of these calls are displayed.

	Usage:  htclient HttpURL [[string_to_flipcase] [ HOSTNAME ]]

        HttpURL - URL of object to try Get Head and Post on.
        If it's 'NIL', then the http_Resource test is skipped.

        string_to_flipcase - a string to have the httest_DerivedResource
        flip the case of.  If it's "raiseerror" then a user
        exception containing the length of string_to_flipcase
         (i.e. 10 is the length of "raiseerror" will
        be generated and returned.

        HOSTNAME - used as part of the id for the server
        of the httest_DerivedResource - defaults to this host.



webserver overview
------------------

	The webserver program implements a simple web server.

	Usage:  webserver [port_number [file_base [verbose] ] ]

	port_number - tcp port the webserver should use - default 80

	file_base - Root location of where server files are stored - default \htmldocs
	Note: currently doesn't deal well with Windows drive identifiers

	verbose - if anthing there as 3nd arg, the program outputs information about 
	what's going on.




Use of Proxy Servers
--------------------
If your site requires use of proxy servers for access outside your
site, and you wish to try running operations across this 'firewall',
then set the environment variable ILU_HTTP_PROXY_INFO to be the 
hostname of your proxy server, followed by a colon, followed by
the port number of the proxy.  e.g. on Windows
	set ILU_HTTP_PROXY_INFO=wwwproxy.my.site.com:8000	 
or on Unix
	setenv ILU_HTTP_PROXY_INFO wwwproxy.my.site.com:8000



Building
--------

To build on Unix use the following commands:

% ilumkmf
% make 

To build on Windows:
(substituting for \iluwin\interfaces appropriately wherever your ilu interfaces are)

	c-stubber \iluwin\interfaces\http.isl	httest.isl

	nmake -f ilunt35.mak CFG="Win32Debug"

or to build a release version

	nmake -f ilunt35.mak CFG="Win32release"

[Note that executables are created in the WinDebug or WinRel subdirectory.]


Examples of Running 
-------------------

1. To illustrate ILU operating with / obtaining an existing Web server's default document

	htclient http://www.myfavoritesite.com


2. To illustrate ILU operating with / obtaining an existing Web server's specific document

	htclient http://www.myfavoritesite.com/pubs/readme.html


3. To illustrate an existing Web Browser accessing the htserver supplied
object (using port 2718 here so I dont' need special privs, and assuming our
machine name is mymachine.mydomain.com)

	htserver 2718 mymachine t

	Now in a Web browser, try getting the URL  http://mymachine.mydomain.com:2718/http_obj0

You should see the response "server_http_Resource_GET" in your browser.


4. To illustrate ILU interacting with ILU

	htserver 2718 mymachine t

	htclient http://mymachine.mydomain.com:2718/http_obj0 FlipMyCase

or to show raising an exception

	htclient http://mymachine.mydomain.com:2718/http_obj0 raiseerror
