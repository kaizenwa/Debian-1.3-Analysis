This simple example pauses for user input everywhere the application gets control.  By deliberately breaking network connectivity at one of these pauses, one can test ILU's reaction to network failures.  The example is available only in C.

To build,

% ilumkmf
% make

To run the server,

% ./server
SBH = 'ilu:DialogTest-Server/it;ilu%3Dp4NgL1yu-oubkE2nAEl9rLUU6iU;sunrpc_2_0x31000400_2621784198@sunrpcrm=tcp_13.2.116.14_4307'

Then run the client

% ./client 'ilu:DialogTest-Server/it;ilu%3Dp4NgL1yu-oubkE2nAEl9rLUU6iU;sunrpc_2_0x31000400_2621784198@sunrpcrm=tcp_13.2.116.14_4307'

passing the host address and port number from the SBH printed by the server.
