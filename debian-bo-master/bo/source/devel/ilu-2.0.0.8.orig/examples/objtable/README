"objtable" is a C example of the use of an object table, to create
true instances on the fly when some client uses them.

To build:

	% ilumkmf
	% make

Running the C server looks like this:

% ./server &
% SID is holmes.4aea.310690e3.71ef

The client is invoked with the SID from the server as an argument:

% ./client holmes.4aea.310690e3.71ef
name of file f1 is <foo>
name of file f2 is <bar>
name of file f3 is <bletch>
%
