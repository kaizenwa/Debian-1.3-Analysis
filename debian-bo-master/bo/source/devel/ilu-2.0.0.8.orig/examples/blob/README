This directory contains an example of a simple shared interaction system
using Python, TK, and ILU.  This example was contributed by Jim Holmes,
at Rank Xerox's Cambridge Research Center.

A server keeps track of a number of colored tokens on a surface.  Each
client can move any token around, by dragging it with a mouse.  Any
moves made by any client are seen by all the other clients.

To build this example, you must first have installed Python, with support
for Tk (the Tkinter Python module).  Then copy the files in this directory
to another test directory, and cd to that directory.

  % ilumkmf
  % make
  python-stubber BlobExample.isl
  client stubs for interface "BlobExample" to BlobExample.py ...
  server stubs for interface "BlobExample" to BlobExample__skel.py ...
  % 

To run this example, first start the server:

  % python blobServer.py &
  1@holmes.745.308700b8.26984e9a@sunrpc_2_0x61a78_2476105499|sunrpcrm|tcp_holmes_4401
  %

Then start several clients:

  % python blobClient.py & python blobClient.py &
  sbh= 1@holmes.745.308700b8.26984e9a@sunrpc_2_0x61a78_2476105499|sunrpcrm|tcp_holmes_4401
  sbh= 1@holmes.745.308700b8.26984e9a@sunrpc_2_0x61a78_2476105499|sunrpcrm|tcp_holmes_4401
  %

You should see a window come up for every client you've started.

Now click with the mouse in one of the client windows.  A small circle will appear in
all the client windows for each click.  You can also grab the circles and move them
around with the mouse, and the movement will be updated in all the client.
