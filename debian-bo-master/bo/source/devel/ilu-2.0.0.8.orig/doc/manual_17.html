<P>
This document describes the TIM documentation language that the documentation for
ILU is written in.  It is not necessary to be familiar with TIM to
use ILU; you will only need to know TIM if you wish to use it to
write or modify documentation.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC276" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC276">TIM</A></H2>
<P>
TIM is essentially a superset of the GNU texinfo language,
version 2.
It adds several features to allow more precise discrimination of semantics
when documenting software systems.  You should be familiar with the basic
texinfo system first.  Documentation on texinfo is supplied
with the ILU distribution; you should be able to find it in the files
<TT>`ilu/doc/texinfo2.ps'</TT>.
<P>
TIM removes the need to begin every file with <CODE>\input texinfo</CODE>,
and to end every file with <CODE>@bye</CODE>.  These lines are added automatically by
TIM as needed.  This allows a file to define both a stand-alone
document, and to be included as a section in some larger document.
<P>
TIM redefines the following texinfo markup commands:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>@var</CODE> is now used to indicate a regular programming language variable.  The term <CODE>@metavar</CODE>
is used to mark meta-variables.
</UL>
<P>
TIM also extends texinfo by adding the following markup:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>@C</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the C language, e.g., <CODE>@C{#define}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@C++</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the C++ language, e.g., <CODE>@C++{#define}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@class</CODE> is used to mark names of object classes.
<LI>
<CODE>@command</CODE> is used to mark user input, such as a user-typed shell command, when it occurs
in the normal flow of text.  The term <CODE>@userinput</CODE> is used when the user input occurs
within a <CODE>@transcript</CODE> section.
<LI>
<CODE>@codeexample</CODE> is used to mark code that is excerpted in the style of a texinfo <CODE>example</CODE>.
The term <CODE>@codeexample</CODE> should appear on a line by itself, before the text of the code, and the
terms <CODE>@end codeexample</CODE> should appear on a line by itself, at the end of the text of the code.
<LI>
<CODE>@cl</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the Common Lisp language,
e.g., <CODE>@cl{defmacro}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@constant</CODE> can be used to mark constant names and values that appear in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@exception</CODE> is used to mark names of exceptions.
<LI>
<CODE>@fn</CODE> is used to mark function names that occur in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@interface</CODE> is used to mark interface names.
<LI>
<CODE>@isl</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the ILU ISL language, e.g. <CODE>@isl{SIBLING}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@kwd</CODE> is used to mark keywords that occur in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@language</CODE> is used to mark names of computer or human languages.
<LI>
<CODE>@m3</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the Modula-3 language, e.g. <CODE>@m3{INTERFACE Foo;}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@macro</CODE> is used to mark names of macros that occur in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@message</CODE> is used to mark in-line text that is a message a program may write to its output.
<LI>
<CODE>@metavar</CODE> is used to mark meta-variables.
<LI>
<CODE>@method</CODE> is used to mark method names.
<LI>
<CODE>@module</CODE> is used to denote module names for those languages
which support them, such as Common Lisp package names, or Modula-3
module names.
<LI>
<CODE>@parm</CODE> is used to mark parameter names.
<LI>
<CODE>@picture</CODE> is used to include a file containing encapsulated Postscript
of a diagram or picture.  It should appear on a line, followed by the name of the file containing the picture, followed
by a newline.  We find the InterViews tool <CODE>idraw</CODE> works well in creating
diagrams in the form of encapsulated Postscript.
<LI>
<CODE>@program</CODE> is used to mark program names that occur in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@protocol</CODE> is used to mark names of ILU RPC protocols.
<LI>
<CODE>@symbol</CODE> is used to mark names of symbols in Makefiles or object files.
<LI>
<CODE>@system</CODE> is used to mark system names that occur in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@switch</CODE> is used to mark command-line switches or options to programs.
<LI>
<CODE>@transcript</CODE> is used to mark an example that is a dialog between a user and a program.
The term <CODE>@transcript</CODE> should appear on a line by itself, before the text of the dialog, and the
terms <CODE>@end transcript</CODE> should appear on a line by itself, at the end of the dialog.
The term <CODE>@userinput</CODE> may be used within a transcript.
<LI>
<CODE>@transport</CODE> is used to mark the names of ILU data transport systems.
<LI>
<CODE>@type</CODE> is used to mark the names of programming language types.
<LI>
<CODE>@url</CODE> is used to mark World Wide Web urls.
<LI>
<CODE>@userinput</CODE> is used to mark text typed by the user in a transcript section.
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC277" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC277">TIM Tools</A></H2>
ILU provides a program called <CODE>tim</CODE> to turn TIM files
into either PostScript or GNU Info files.  It is
invoked either as
<PRE>
% <STRONG>tim -t <VAR>INPUTFILE</VAR>.tim &#62;<VAR>OUTPUTFILE</VAR>.ps</STRONG>
</PRE>
to produce PostScript code from a .tim file, or as
<PRE>
% <STRONG>tim -i <VAR>INPUTFILE</VAR>.tim &#62;<VAR>OUTPUTFILE</VAR>.info</STRONG>
</PRE>
to produce GNU Info code, or as
<PRE>
% <STRONG>tim -w <VAR>INPUTFILE</VAR>.tim &#62;<VAR>OUTPUTFILE</VAR>.html</STRONG>
</PRE>
to produce World Wide Web HTML, or as
<PRE>
% <STRONG>tim -x <VAR>INPUTFILE</VAR>.tim &#62;<VAR>OUTPUTFILE</VAR>.texinfo</STRONG>
</PRE>
to produce GNU texinfo code.
<P>
<CODE>tim</CODE> is a script written in the perl script language,
so you will need to have <CODE>perl</CODE> installed to use it.  See the
ILU installation instructions for a location from which <CODE>perl</CODE>
can be FTP'ed.
