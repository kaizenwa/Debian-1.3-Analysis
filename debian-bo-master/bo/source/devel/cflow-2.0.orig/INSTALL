Cflow is a bash script, requiring to sub programs

I use it in an environment with 
gcc, gnu fileutils, gnu make and bash.

	1) set CFLOW_SHELL to be the actual path of bash
	2) Set PREFIX to be the root of where
	   you want to install the programs and man page.

I use cproto to generate prototypes, they are provided.
