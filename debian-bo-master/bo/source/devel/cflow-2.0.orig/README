This is a enhanced copy of cflow I've been using, which has been
floating around for a number of years.

This works well if you use GNU make, gcc and bash.


With anything else, you mileage may vary.

Some combinations of code/header file require a little coaxing.

Many contributions are more than a decade old.

I've seen some problems on various systems...
For example, on linux I get:
cflow prcc.c
/u/marty/bin/prcc: cannot redefine: sys_nerr    {v /usr/include/errno.h 8}
/u/marty/bin/prcc: cannot redefine: sys_errlist {v /usr/include/errno.h 9}
/u/marty/bin/prcc: cannot redefine: _sys_nerr   {v /usr/include/errno.h 12}
/u/marty/bin/prcc: cannot redefine: _sys_errlist        {v /usr/include/errno.h 13}
1       __gnu_calloc {/usr/include/stdlib.h 183}
2               calloc {}
3       __gnu_malloc {/usr/include/stdlib.h 188}
4               malloc {}


Get around this with:
leisner@compaq$ cflow -X 'errno.h stdlib.h' prcc.c

to produce the file in examples/prcc.cflow
