LOAD filename

	command.  Reads instructions from the named file and executes
	them.  The file can include procedure definitions with TO, and
	these are accepted even if a procedure by the same name already
	exists.  If the file assigns a list value to a variable named
	STARTUP, then that list is run as an instructionlist after the
	file is loaded.
