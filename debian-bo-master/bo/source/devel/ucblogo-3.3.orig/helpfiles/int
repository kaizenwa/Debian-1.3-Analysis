INT num

	outputs its input with fractional part removed, i.e., an integer
	with the same sign as the input, whose absolute value is the
	largest integer less than or equal to the absolute value of
	the input.

	Note:  Inside the computer numbers are represented in two different
	forms, one for integers and one for numbers with fractional parts.
	However, on most computers the largest number that can be represented
	in integer format is smaller than the largest integer that can be
	represented (even with exact precision) in floating-point (fraction)
	format.  The INT operation will always output a number whose value
	is mathematically an integer, but if its input is very large the output
	may not be in integer format.  In that case, operations like REMAINDER
	that require an integer input will not accept this number.
