For 1.0:

* Have people test libtool on AIX 3, OSF/1, HP-UX, and SunOS 4.

* Don't forget to find link_static_flag for native cc's on HP-UX and
OSF/1.

* Implement shared libraries and `-static' linking on platforms that
support them.  Ones that stand out, which libtool doesn't support:
IRIX.

For 1.1:

* Implement full support for other basic library types (libhello_g,
libhello_p).  Make these types configurable.  Some thinking will have
to be done about the defaults, and what libhello (standard type)
should be.

Sometime in the future (maybe):

* Add support for windoze DLL's, and maybe old Linux jumptable
libraries.  Check out Lesstif and Tcl configuration again.

* What should be done about the difference between -fpic and -fPIC?

* GCC docs imply that all rs6000 code is PIC.  See if it is true of
any other processors (like maybe powerpc).

* Maybe choosing between ln -s and cp -p should be done in ltconfig,
not ltmain.sh?
