NOTE:   The version referred to here is the version of the distribution,
        not of the icmake programs.
	----------------------------------------------------------------

6.21    Elf binaries for unix

6.20    Unix-icmake accepts the -t flag, to specify a temporary binary-
        icmake file. Allowing in unix-environments the riddance of the
        permanent bim-file. The temporary binary makefile will --in this
        case-- get the process-id for its extension.

6.18 - 6.19: Not distributed.

6.17b   DOS-distribution only: Dependencies on icce.h and sicce.lib
	removed from the distribution. Programs are *not* affected by
	this distribution.
	
6.17    Comment accepted in #define directives,
        Trailing info on #include lines ignored,
	Minor changes to documentation files.

6.17    This is as far as our memory reaches: the log of changes before
        this distribution are lost to future generations...
        This release never made sunsite or tsx-11. Only ftp.icce.rug.nl
	got it, and two sub-releases beyond.
