                        UUDEVIEW FOR UNIX INSTALLATION
                                       
   The first step, of course, is to get a copy of the source code to your
   hard disk. If you have not already done so, step back to the previous
   page and download a copy.
   
   You will also need the following:
     * An ANSI-compatible C compiler.
       My recommendation is that you use the GNU C compiler. An old K&R C
       Compiler will probably not be able to compile this program. Such a
       prehistoric beast is the default with SunOS 4.X. Hurry and get the
       GNU compiler.
     * (Optional) If you have Tcl Version 7.5 or greater installed, the
       visual frontend xdeview will be installed, too.
       
   To install the files in Unix, there are three steps to do:
    1. Configuration.
    2. Compilation.
    3. Installation.
       
Configuration

   UUDeview comes with an Autoconf configuration script, which will
   usually set all the necessary options for your system automatically.
   You simply invoke this script by entering

        ./configure

   However, there are some options this script can't guess, which you
   might have to set manually by passing parameters to the configuration
   script. You can receive a complete list of options with the --help
   parameter. Don't be overwhelmed by them, usually you won't need one of
   them. Here's a description of the more important options:
   
   --prefix=DIR
          Sets the base path where the binaries and manual pages will be
          installed to. Biaries will go to DIR/bin, and manuals to
          DIR/man. The default location is /usr/local. If you just want
          to keep the files in your own directories, use --prefix=$HOME.
          You can also set the binary and manual paths separately using
          --bindir and --mandir.
          
   --enable-tcl=DIR
          Use this option if you have Tcl installed in a non-standard
          location. We will need the Tcl include file <tcl.h> in
          DIR/include and the Tcl library <libtcl*.a> in DIR/lib.
          
   --enable-tk=DIR
          Same for your Tk installation.
          
   --disable-tcl
          Use if you don't want support for the Tcl/Tk extensions. You
          will not get to see the Tk frontend, but with this option, the
          resulting binaries will shrink to a more reasonable size.
          
   --disable-manuals
          If you don't want to get the manual pages installed.
          
   --enable-sendmail=PROG
          Use PROG to mail messages to the internet. The program is given
          a list of white-space separated recipients on the command line
          and is fed the mail message, including headers, via standard
          input. One use of this option is to define a program doing
          certain preprocessing on the message before handing it over to
          the mail system.
          If this option is not used, the configuration script does try
          to locate certain common mail agents by itself, with sendmail
          being the first choice.
          You can also use --disable-sendmail to disable the mail sending
          facility altogether.
          
   --enable-inews=PROG
          Use PROG to post articles to the usenet. The program is given
          the parameter "-h" on the command line and is fed the article,
          including headers, via standard input. (The -h option usually
          instructs inews to honor the message's headers.) One use of
          this option is to define a program doing certain preprocessing
          on the article before handing it over to the news system.
          If this option is not used, the configuration script tries to
          locate the inews program, or configures itself to compile and
          use the replacement mini-inews.
          You can also use --disable-inews to disable the message posting
          facility altogether.
          
   --disable-minews
          If there's no news system installed on your site, a replacement
          inews, which is capable of posting files to a newsgroup, will
          be installed. Use this option if you don't want this program to
          be installed, or if it fails to compile (it's not quite as
          portable as the rest of the code).
          
   --enable-posting=server
          If using our replacement inews, we must have the address of a
          server we can route our postings to. With this option, you can
          specify the hostname or IP address of such a news serving host.
          You can always override this setting at runtime by setting the
          NNTPSERVER environment variable.
          
   --enable-domain=domainname
          If using our replacement inews, we need the name of a domain to
          identify ourselves. The configuration script knows of some
          means where to get your site's domain name from. If these tests
          fail, you should set the name with this parameter (otherwise, a
          bogus name will be configured). Note that the name of your
          domain does not include the hostname.
          
   You should have a look at the messages the run of ./configure
   generates. If you believe there's something wrong with them, you'll
   probably need one of the above options to correct it.
   
Compilation

   This step should be a piece of cake. Just issue the following command:

        make

   This will hopefully compile everything. Depending on the
   configuration, two or more binaries should appear in the various
   subdirectories: unix/uudeview and unix/uuenview (always), tcl/uuwish
   (only with Tcl support enabled), tcl/xdeview (only with Tcl/Tk support
   enabled) and inews/minews (only if no inews was found on your system).
   
   In the unlikely event of compiler errors, email me the output of the
   ./configure run, the resulting files 'Makefile', 'config.h' and
   'config.log', and the output of 'make'.
   
Installation

   Installation should be just as simple as compilation. If you chose to
   install the programs globally, make sure you run the following command
   as root.

        make install

   This copies the binaries and manual pages to their final locations.
   
   You should now test the installation by invoking uudeview and
   uuenview. Both should print a short description of their
   command-line options.
   
   If it works, congratulations, you have successfully installed the
   UUDeview package. You can now go on and test whether mailing and
   posting from uuenview works, preferredly by emailing a file to
   yourself and posting to local test newsgroups.
   
   Note: During installation, the program xdeview is branded with the
   final location of the uuwish program. You cannot execute xdeview
   before uudeview has been copied (installed) to its final location.
   Also, if you decide to move the installation, edit the first line of
   the xdeview script to match the new location of xdeview.
   
     Optionally, you may also try to use the compatibility features of
     both tools by symlinking uuencode to uuenview and uudecode to
     uudeview. Called like that, both tools will try to mimic their
     predecessors' behaviour (but of couse being much smarter).
