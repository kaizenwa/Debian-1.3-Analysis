.SH NAME
deb-make \- Debianize a sourcecode package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdeb-make\fP [\fBnative\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
deb-make is a tool to convert a regular sourcecodepackage into one formatted
according to the requirements of the 
debian project. deb-make should be invoked withinn the sourcecode directory
which should be named <packagename>-<version>. The packagename must be all
lowercase, digits and dashes. If the directory name does not conform to the scheme then please
rename the directory before using deb-make.

.SH PACKAGE CLASSES
.TP
.B Single
The package will generate a single binary .deb package. This is the standard
case if you dont know what to do choose this.
.TP
.B Multi
The package will generate multiple binary .deb packages from one source
package. Choose this for larger packages.
.TP
.B Library
The package will generate at least two binaries. One library package
containing just the lib in /usr/lib and another *-dev_*.deb package
containing documentation and C headers.
.SH ACTIONS PERFORMED
.B deb-make
copies the archive on the higher directory level into
<packagename>-<version>.orig if that directory does not exist.
The orig archive is needed for other debian
tools to generate the diffs to the original sources required by the debian
packaging format.
.PP
Then deb-make proceeds to generate a "debian" subdirectory and the necessary
control files in the subdirectory. Those control files are customized with the
packagename and version extracted from the directory name and the
username and the e-mail address build from /etc/mailname and from /etc/passwd
(Sorry no YP support right now).
If the environment variable
.B EMAIL
is set then that EMAIL address is used for the e-mail address of the
maintainer instead of looking it up in the environment.
.PP
deb-make will also generate example files that are also customized for the
package generated. You can remove all files with *.ex if you wish. Renaming
those to their name without the .ex at the end will activate that feature
of debstd.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I native
Do not generate a .orig archive. The package is a native Debian package that
does not need any diffs. The version number will not have a debian release
number in it.
