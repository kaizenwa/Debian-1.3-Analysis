This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of mgetty+sendfax
Mgetty was written by Gert Doering <gert@greenie.muc.de>
or <gert.doering@physik.tu-muenchen.de>

This package was put together by Nils Rennebarth
<nils@nus.pan-net.de> from sources found at
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Serial/mgetty+sendfax-0.98.tar.gz

Later this package was upgraded and further cleaned up by
Christoph Lameter using sources found at
ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/networking/communication/modem/mgetty

This is the copyright for mgetty+sendfax:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Copying conditions and (lack of) warranty
=========================================

   *WARNING:* This package is still BETA software. Use it at your own
risk, there is *no* warranty. If it erases all the data on your hard
disk, damages your hardware, or kills your dog, that is entirely your
problem. Anyway, the program works for me and quite a lot of other
people.

   The `mgetty+sendfax' package is Copyright (C) 1993,1994,1995 Gert
Doering.

   You are permitted to redistribute `mgetty+sendfax' freely, modify it,
include it in other programs, ..., as long as you don't make profit
directly out of selling `mgetty' (see below), include the complete
`mgetty' source, and do not remove my name. If you distribute a
modified version, or include `mgetty' code in your projects, mark it
clearly as such ("... *derived* from `mgetty+sendfax' by Gert Doering")!

   If the program works for you, and you want to honour my efforts, you
are invited to donate as much as you want...

   What I mean above with "as long as you don't make profit directly
out of selling `mgetty'" is: it is perfectly OK if you get paid for
`mgetty' support, or if you distribute `mgetty' among other goodies on
a CD-ROM collection or whatever, but if you sell `mgetty' bundled with
a faxmodem as "unix fax package" or "with unix software!", or if you
start selling `mgetty' with only minor enhancements for lots of money,
I want a share. If in doubt, just ask me.

   In any case, if you don't like the restrictions in this license,
contact me, and we can work something out.

   This license expires, that is, two years after release date, a given
`mgetty+sendfax' release falls into the public domain, and everybody is
absolutely free to do with the code what he wants.
