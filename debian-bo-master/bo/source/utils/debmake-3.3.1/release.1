.SH DESCRIPTION
.I release
does all the actions necessary to release a debian package. It will:
.PP
- Upload the package to some site
.PP
- Generate an announcement to the correct mailing list. (please make sure
that "stable" is listed first if you want an announcement on
debian-changes). Announcement is skipped if the
.B silent
option is given
.PP
- Create a file \fBRELEASED\fP in the debian directory so that the
\fBdebchange\fP tool will increment the release number on the next
modification that is registered to debian/changelog.
.PP
- Check if there are any "#number" items in the changelog. If so it will
offer to clear those bugs by sending the changelog to
number-done@bugs.debian.org.
.PP
If
.B dupload(1)
is installed then the upload will be performed using that package instead.
All parameters given on the commandline will be passed to it.
.PP
If the enviromentvariable
.B AUTOCLEAR_BUGS
is set to some value then
.B release
will not ask for confirmation if bugs marked in the changes file should be
cleared but will go ahead and do it.
.SH OPTIONS
If dupload is installed then all options given are passed to it.
.TP
.B announce
Usually
.B release
is invoked without any options resulting in a posting of the
changelog entry. If
.B announce
is specified on the commandline then
.B release
will post the contents of
.B debian/control
to the corresponding list.
.TP
.B silent
Dont generate an announcement just upload the package.
.TP
.B upload-site
The site to upload the software to. Must be listed in
/usr/lib/deb-make/upload.sites and you need to have clearance from that site
to upload software using
.B scp
.SH REQUIREMENTS
If the dupload package is not installed then the tool will use the
.B scp
command to transfer files
thus you need to have the ssh package installed so that this may work. Also
you need to have an account on the upload-site with the same accountname on the local
machine from which the upload is performed. You need to have setup an
.B .shosts
file and taken care of the proper identification of your machine
to master (see the ssh documentation) so that
.B scp
can run without a problem.
