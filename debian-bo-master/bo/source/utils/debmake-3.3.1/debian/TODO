Here is a list of ideas about functionality that could / should be added
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make debmake recognize imakefiles etc

2. Make debmake find a *lsm file and act on its contents

3. Setup a mail filter for developers.
   It could:
   -> Respond to bugreports regarding outdated packages
   -> Respond to bugreports regarding packages no longer maintained
      forwarding them to the correct maintainer.
