This is a copy of Tim Bray's Bonnie. Found the source at ftp.cdrom.com in
/pub/unix-c/benchmarks/bonnie which was a copy of the post to usenet made
some time back. 

Most of the man page I slapped together was pulled out of the comments
at the start of the C code verbatim. No makefile, I'm too lazy.

     gcc -O2 -o bonnie bonnie.c

works fine. I threw this together to build an RPM, but figured I'd
upload it to sunsite as well.
