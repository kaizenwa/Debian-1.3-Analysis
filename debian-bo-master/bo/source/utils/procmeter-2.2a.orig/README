                      PROCMETER V2.2
                      ==============

A simple X based performance meter for Linux (like xmeter).
Displays statistics direct from /proc on the local machine only.


Usage: procmeter [-h] [-update u] [-horizontal|-vertical] [options ...]

-h              Print out a help message.
-update u       The time interval between updates in seconds.
-horizontal     Use a horizontal arrangement of meters.
-vertical       Use a vertical arrangement of meters.
-force-spkt     Force spkt statistics even if not auto-detected.
options ...     One or more of the statistics options below.


Available statistics are in a number of classes

Processes:

cpu         %  Total cpu usage
cpu-user    %  cpu used by user processes
cpu-nice    %  cpu used by niced processes
cpu-sys     %  cpu used by system processes
cpu-idle    %  cpu unused
load           System load
proc           The number of processes (kernel version >1.2)
context        Number of context switches

Virtual Memory:

swap           Amount of swapping
swap-in        Amount of swap in
swap-out       Amount of swap out
page           Amount of paging
page-in        Amount of page in
page-out       Amount of page out

Hardware:

disk           Amount of disk accesses
intr           Number of interrupts

Memory:

mem-free    MB Amount of free memory
mem-used    MB Amount of used memory
mem-buff    MB Amount of file buffer memory
mem-cache   MB Amount of cached memory (kernel version >2.0)
mem-swap    MB Amount of swap space used

Network:

lpkt           Number of packets              'Local' interfaces (lo and dummy).
fpkt           Number of packets             \   'Fast' interfaces
fpkt-rx        Number of received packets     |       (eth etc.,
fpkt-tx        Number of transmitted packets /         all those not in spkt).
spkt           Number of packets             \   'Slow' interfaces
spkt-rx        Number of received packets     |       (slip, ppp, plip,
spkt-tx        Number of transmitted packets /         flip, isdn, ippp).


Installation
------------

Edit the Makefile to set the paths for installation (INSTDIR), the X Windows
directory (XINCLUDE,XLIB) and the compiler options (CC,CFLAGS).

make procmeter
make install

And all should be OK. If not and you are using X11R5, then see the Makefile for
the alternate link command with fewer libraries.


When installed, the environment variable XFILESEARCHPATH or XUSERFILESEARCHPATH
should be set to $(INSTDIR)/lib/app-defaults/%N to see the installed X resources.

The manual page gives more details on how to use the program.


This program has been tested on Linux 1.1.57 (no disks, kernel problem).
                                Linux 1.2.13,
                                Linux 2.0.7.
