Version 2.2a of ProcMeter released : Sat Mar 15 20:00:00 1997
-------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed bugs with new kernel change, string overflow (again), make install.


Version 2.2 of ProcMeter released : Sun Nov  3 15:00:00 1996
------------------------------------------------------------

Added a -force-spkt option to force spkt statistics even if not auto-detected.
Choice of solid or line graph provided via X resources.

Modified Statistics:
spkt           Number of packets             \   'Slow' interfaces
spkt-rx        Number of received packets     |       (slip, ppp, plip,
spkt-tx        Number of transmitted packets /         flip, isdn, ippp).

Tested on Linux 1.2.13.


Version 2.1 of ProcMeter released : Sun Sep  1 14:00:00 1996
------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the problem with being unable to read context data from /proc/stat.
Fixed a number of problems with network statistics.
Scaling of memory graph depends on total amount of RAM.
Grid lines can be turned off.
Overload conditions with too many grid lines cause them to be removed.
Improved the description of X resources in the manual page.

Added Statistic:
proc           The number of processes

Removed Statistics:
lpkt-rx        Number of received packets    \ 'Local' interfaces
lpkt-tx        Number of transmitted packets /      (lo and dummy).

Modified Statistics:
spkt           Number of packets             \
spkt-rx        Number of received packets     | 'Slow' interfaces
spkt-tx        Number of transmitted packets /      (sl, ppp, plip, flip).

Tested on Linux 1.2.13.


Version 2.0 of ProcMeter released : Sat Aug 17 13:00:00 1996
------------------------------------------------------------

Almost completely rewritten.
Uses custom Widget for the graphs, better than Athena one for this task:
  New meters line up on the right with the existing ones.
  All meters updated simultaneously (push rather than pull the data).
Uses less resources, only 1/2 of the cpu and 1/3 of the memory of Version 1.1a.
Checks for compatability of /proc files on startup (in case of kernel changes).
Allows choice of horizontal or vertical layout.

Added Statistic:
mem-cache   MB Amount of cached memory (kernel version >2.0)

Modified Statistics:
lpkt           Number of packets             \
lpkt-rx        Number of received packets     | 'Local' interfaces
lpkt-tx        Number of transmitted packets /      (lo and dummy).
fpkt           Number of packets             \
fpkt-rx        Number of received packets     | 'Fast' interfaces
fpkt-tx        Number of transmitted packets /      (eth and others).
spkt           Number of packets             \
spkt-rx        Number of received packets     | 'Slow' interfaces
spkt-tx        Number of transmitted packets /      (sl, ppp, plip).

Tested on Linux 1.1.0, 1.1.57, 1.2.13, 2.0.7


Version 1.1a of procmeter released : Mon Mar 18 18:00:00 1996

Version 1.1 of procmeter released : Sat Mar 16 13:40:00 1996
------------------------------------------------------------

Added Statistic:
disk           Amount of disk accesses

Modified Statistics:
pkt1           Number of packets             \
pkt1-rx        Number of received packets     | 'Fast' interfaces
pkt1-tx        Number of transmitted packets /      (eth and lo).
pkt2           Number of packets             \
pkt2-rx        Number of received packets     | 'Slow' interfaces
pkt2-tx        Number of transmitted packets /      (sl and ppp).
