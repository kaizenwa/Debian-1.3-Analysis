`time' is a program that measures many of the CPU resources, such as
time and memory, that other programs use.  The GNU version can format
the output in arbitrary ways by using a printf-style format string to
include various resource measurements.  On systems that don't (fully)
support the BSD wait3 system call, it is able to measure only a few
resources.  It reports unavailable information as zero values.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.
