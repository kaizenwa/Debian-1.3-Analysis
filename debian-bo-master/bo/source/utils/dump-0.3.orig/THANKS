Dump and restore were written by the people of the CSRG at the University
of California, Berkeley.

They were ported to Linux by Remy Card <Remy.Card@freenix.fr>, by using
the Ext2fs library, written by Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>.

Kevin Layer <layer@Franz.COM> added the comparison code in restore.

Doug Paul <dbp@dragonsys.com> helped me to make dump able to backup 2GB+
filesystems.

Thanks to people who reported problems with the port, sent patches, and
suggested various improvements.
