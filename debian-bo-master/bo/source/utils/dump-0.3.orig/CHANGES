Changes between versions 0.2e and 0.2f
======================================

1.	Added the creation of named pipes (fifos) in restore.

2.	Added the -N flag in the restore manual page.

3.	Added the file kernel.patch which contains the llseek() optimization
	patch for 1.2.x kernels.

4.	Fixed a bug in the restoration of symbolic links: owner and group were
	not restored.

5.	Integrated some changes from FreeBSD 2.2.

6.	Added a call to ftruncate() after restoring each file to restore
	correctly files ending by a hole.

Changes between versions 0.2d and 0.2e
======================================

1.	Fixed a bug in the "set owner/mode" process.  Every file was restored
	with owner = root (0) and group = root/wheel/whatever (0).

Changes between versions 0.2c and 0.2d
======================================

1.	Dump is now able to backup 2GB+ filesystems.

2.	Dump and restore can now be linked as static binaries.

Changes between versions 0.2b and 0.2c
======================================

1.	Fixed a bug when dumping ``slow'' (i.e. normal) symbolic links.

Changes between versions 0.2a and 0.2b
======================================

1.	Really fixed the bug that I should have corrected in 0.2a.

2.	Enabled optimization again.

Changes between versions 0.2 and 0.2a
=====================================

1.	Disabled the optimization during compilation.

Changes between versions 0.1 and 0.2
====================================

1.	Fixed a bug in fstab.c which caused a null pointer to be stored in
	the fs_type field (actually, I modified the file fstab.c to make it
	use the mntent functions).

2.	Dump and restore now use a 4.3 BSD compatible dump format.  Backups
	made by dump should be readable by the BSD restore and backups made
	by the BSD dump should be readable by restore.  Unfortunately, this
	means that the dump format has changed between version 0.1 and version
	0.2 :-(

3.	Dump is now able to backup a subtree, it is no longer limited to whole
	filesystems like the BSD version.

4.	Dump now uses ext2_llseek() so it is able to backup filesystems bigger
	than 2 GB.

Changes between versions 0.0 and 0.1
====================================

1.	Now create links rdump and rrestore during the `make install' step.

2.	Linux port specific bugs added to the manual pages

3.	Incorrect estimation of the number of tapes blocks fixed when doing
	incremental backups.

4.	Better ls-like format in restore in interactive mode.
