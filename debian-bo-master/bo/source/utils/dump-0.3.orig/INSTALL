	Installation of the dump/restore port should be quite easy.

	First edit the file MCONFIG to change parameters and type `make' to
compile the programs.  Then you can type `make install' to install the
programs in /sbin and the manual pages in /usr/man/man8.

	You need to have the source distribution of the latest Ext2fs programs
since this version of dump uses the Ext2fs library written by Theodore T'so.
Change the GINC and GLIBDIR macros in MCONFIG to indicate where the Ext2fs
programs are located.  The Ext2fs programs distribution is available from
tsx-11.mit.edu in the directory /pub/linux/packages/ext2fs.

	Please note that if you want to compile dump and restore as ELF
binaries, you need to apply my patch to the e2fsprogs-0.5b distribution to
create ELF libraries.  This patch is available on ftp.ibp.fr in the
directory /pub/linux/ELF/patches.

	Last, if you use Linux 1.2.x, you may want to apply a kernel patch to
speed up dump.  The file `kernel.patch' in the dump distribution contains a
patch which adds an optimization to the llseek() system call.  This patch has
been integrated in the 1.3 kernel but not in the 1.2 branch.  People have
reported that this patch speeds up dump by a factor of 2 or 3.
