.SH NAME
hextype \- hexadecimal dump program
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B hextype
[-l <numlines> | -b <numbytes>] files...
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B hextype
displays a hexadecimal output of each file given at the commandline.

The output consists of 3 columns. Each row contains up to 16 characters.
The first column contains the address of the row (in 16-byte words).
In the second column each byte is represented by its hex-value (00 to FF)
and in the third are the bytes in printable characters (unlike
.I od -c
.B hextype
does not print unprintable chars with a 2-char "escape-sequence".
They are replaces by a dot.

If no filename is specified
.B hextype
prints a short version information and exits.

.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B files...
The files to be hextyped. The following options are aplied for all files.

.TP
.B numlines
The number of lines to be display for each file.
.B Hextype
displayes only the first
.I numlines
number of lines.

.TP
.B numbytes
The number of bytes to be display for each file.
.B Hextype
displayes only the first
.I numbytes
number of bytes.

.RS

.RE

It does not make much sense to use -b and -l together. Therefor only the
last option is used. So
.B hextype
.I -b 4 -l 10 data.bin
would display the first 10 lines (or 160 bytes).

.SH BUGS
.PP

When processing
.I stdin
hextype does not stop reading on the first solitary
.I EOF
(Ctrl-D) character in the input stream. Two EOF chars are required
to end reading from stdin.


.SH TODO

Support reading from stdin.
Use mmap(2) instead of subsequent fread(2) for better performance.
