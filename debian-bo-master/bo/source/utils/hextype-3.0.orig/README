hextype 3.0 - A tool to display files in hexadecimal mode

try it out! - its better than od.

NOTE: hextype does not explicitly support reading from stdin !
(i.e. "hextype -" tries to open a file named "-")
However you can type "hextype /proc/self/fd/0" do force hextype to
process stdin.

BUGS: When processing non-seekable files (i.e. stdin) hextype does
not stop on the first EOF-char encountered. You have to provide 2 (two)
EOF-chars to terminate reading. (hit Ctrl-D twice if dumping from keyboard)
