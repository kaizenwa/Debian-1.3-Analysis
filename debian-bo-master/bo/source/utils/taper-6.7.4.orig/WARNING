Please note that this is BETA software. This means that it is still
under development. This program works fine on my setup (DX2-66,
Jumbo 250, Floppy controller, 32Mb RAM, 3 IDE hard drives (120mb,
120mb, 540mb), Suprafax modem, Mitsumi Quad Speed IDE CD-ROM, serial mouse).

However, there are hundreds (if not thousands) of different configurations out
there. I cannot test them all (which why this software is beta). Before
using this program for 'production' backups, PLEASE ensure that both
the backup and restore programs work correctly on YOUR system. Until you
have confirmed this (several times, I suggest), then only should you
use this as your only means of backup. Until then, please also backup using
a method you KNOW works for you.

Having said this, from the comments I have received so far, it does
seem to work on a fair few systems so I hope it does work on yours.

If you have a problem, please let me know, giving me as much detail
as possible (it is impossible to respond to comments such as "This program
crashed after starting. What's wrong?). Include your configuration, exactly
where/what the problem is and if you can use gdb, the source line in which
the crash/problem occurred.

As this is a sideline, I may not be able to respond to e-mail immediately. 
However, if you do not receive a reply within one week, then repost as
I may have forgotten about it!


Happy backing up,

Yusuf
