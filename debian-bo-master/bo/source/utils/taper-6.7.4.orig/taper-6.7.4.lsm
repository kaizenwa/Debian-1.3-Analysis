Title:		Taper
Version:  	6.7.4
Entered-date:	5AUG96
Description:	This is a tape backup and restore program that provides
		a friendly user interface to allow backing/restoring
		files to a tape drive. Alternatively, files can be backed
		up to hard disk files. Selecting files for backup and restore
	 	is very similar to the Mouseless Commander interface and
		allows easy traversal of directories. Recursively selected
		directories are supported. Incremental backup and automatic
		most recent restore are defaults settings. SCSI, ftape,
		zftape, and removable drives are supported (ide tape drives
		in ALPHA stage)
		Information about archives is stored on the hard disk 
		allowing information about  archives to be obtained without
		having to have the tape in the drive. 
Keywords:	Tape, Backup, Archive
