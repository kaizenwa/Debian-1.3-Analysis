A sgml file is provided so you can create any type of
documentation file (provided you have the linuxdoc-sgml package) 
that is, a postscript file, an ASCII file, an info file or an
HTML file.

To create a postscript file:
	sgml2ps taper

To create an info file:
	sgml2info taper

To create an ASCII file:
	sgml2txt taper

For those of you that don't have the linuxdoc-sgml package, I have
included an ASCII file, called taper.txt. To read it, type:
	less taper.txt
