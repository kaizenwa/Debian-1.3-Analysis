If you have a bug to report, could you set the log-level to 4 (using -m 4)
and then send me a copy of the log file. Also please be exact with an
error messages that taper gives you.

This makes it easier to track down problems because then I have a fair idea 
of what taper was trying to do when the problem arose.

Of course, I also need to know basic things like your tape drive, kernel
version, a.out/ELF, ncurses version, C library version.
