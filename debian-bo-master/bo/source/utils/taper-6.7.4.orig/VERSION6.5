FROM VERSION 6.5
----------------

Rename the following files:

   .taper_log  to taper_log
   .taper_prefs to taper_prefs
   
and rename the following directories:
   
   .taper_info to taper_info
   

If you used version 6.4 or 6.3 on a big endian machine, you will have
to reconstruct your info files since info files are now stored in little
endian format. Don't rebackup, just recreate the info file. This does
not apply to Linux on a PC (which is a little endian machine).



FROM VERSION 6.4
----------------

To accommodate the even more intelligent restore, the structure
of the info file has had to be changed. Therefore, info files
created with taper versions < 6.4 will NOT work with taper 6.4 and
above. 

You do NOT have to re-backup your archives, just run the
"recreate info file" option from the main menu. This will create
an updated info file for use with 6.4 and above.

This does not affect the full restore option.
