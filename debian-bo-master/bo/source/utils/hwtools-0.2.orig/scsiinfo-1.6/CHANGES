These are the changes that I, M. Weller (eowmob@exp-math.uni-essen.de)
made from version 1.4a:
My main intention was to add support for log pages. However even though
one of my disks supports log sense it seems not to return anything senseable.
For example the 1st byte that was returned is 0x23 even in page 0. This is
complete nonsense.

scsiinfo.c:
	Real return codes: 2 - syntax, 1 - error, 0 - ok.
	-L option to display list of supported/notched mode pages and active notch.
	Name of page given in error messages.
	MODE_SENSE_10 support for -L option (don't know a device that supports it).
	More devices for -l, uses nst?, non rewinding scsi-tape is much faster.
	Useful and more usage messages.
	hexoutput for boundaries in notch page is more useful for physical notches.
	ending boundary for notch page fixed.
	intfield and friends, length of description string changed.
	support for Verify Error Recovery page.
	support for arbitrary hex fields (needed for Peripheral Device Page);
	support for Peripheral Device Page
        support for writing an executable save file (-LXR option)

scsi-config:
	Window layout unified. (scsi-config tk/*).
	Notch page buttons are marked (and active notch given).
	Only buttons for supported pages (auto setup).
	Select first button in select device dialog.
	No save button if no cache-page (scsiinfo - internal misfeature).
	No continue button if no device accessible in select device dialog.
	Changed non-root warning message.
	support for Verify Error Recovery page.
	support for Peripheral Device Page
        support for Save to file.
        support for Geometry Overview.

tk/generic:
	Reread mode page after change to display set values.

tk/notch:
	Reenable/disable text widgets. (it is impossible to edit disabled text widgets.
	  this was needed cause readonly fields may change when the active notch
	  changes).
	
tk/verify:
	new file (based on tk/error)

tk/peripheral:
	new file

tk/save-file:
	new file

tk/overview:
	new file

Makefile:
	support for install-wish script to auto search the wish executable
	   and change the #! entries according to these.
