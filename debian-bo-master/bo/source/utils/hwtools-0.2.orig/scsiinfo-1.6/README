	This is version 1.5 of scsiinfo.  The program itself is pretty
much the same, but there is now support for modifying the parameters
on the pages.  This is not easy to do through scsiinfo alone unless
you pay close attention - it is trivial to do through the X-based
interface.

	The X interface uses Tck/Tk and wish rather heavily.  The
advantage is that the "source" files are merely short scripts, so
there is not a lot of work involved in getting the windows laid out
and so forth.  Currently only the cache control page has a window
associated with the page.  The others have stub scripts which do not
do anything yet.

	Anyway, you can use the Makefile to compile and link scsiinfo,
and then use the "make install" command to move everything to the
correct directories.  Both the scsiinfo binary and the scsi-config
script (the X-based interface) are moved to /usr/bin.

	Note:  In the X based interface, you will not be able to change
some fields.  The fields that are protected are the ones that your drive
reports as being unmodifiable.

	Have fun.  BTW: don't turn on the write cache unless you
really know what you are doing.

	Warning, the defect list code prints correct data if the target
supports the indexbytes list format. Some disks may have problems
with that. My do actually crash the system (hard reset causes reboot but
SCSI lockups shortly after on my System (AHA1742 with Toshiba and IBM disks),
complete powercycle was needed) if queried for other formats. (Michael)

WHATS NEW: Version 1.5:
	Your turn Eric, see the CHANGES file

WHATS NEW: Version 1.4:

	Cleanups all over the place.   Much more compact, and much
	easier to notice bugs.

	You can now save the current operating parameters to the drive's
	NOVRAM.

WHATS NEW: Version 1.3:

	Support for Notch page.

	All windows can write parameters back to the drive (if device
	allows it).

	A few bugfixes here and there.

	A few patches from Harald Koenig.
