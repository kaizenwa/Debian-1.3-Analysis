	Start adding support for some of the log pages (i.e. view error
	logs on the drive).  My drive apparently does not support this.
         Mine says it does, but returns garbage that does not conform
	 the SCSI-2 docs (Michael Weller).

        Better handling of devices that do not support the requested
        defect list format. Mine do only support the bytesfromindex
        format and crash otherwise, so no way to do that (Michael Weller)
