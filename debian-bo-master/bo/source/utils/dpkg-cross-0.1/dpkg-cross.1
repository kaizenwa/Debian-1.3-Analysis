.TH DPKG-CROSS 1 
.SH NAME
dpkg-cross \- install cross compiling libraries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpkg-cross
[-a\fIarch\fR] [-irsL] \fIpackages\fR ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B dpkg-cross
is a tool to install and manage libraries and header files for cross
compiling. It is a (very) lightweight clone of \fBdpkg\fR and
resembles a few of its options. But it has only a few features the
real \fBdpkg\fR has, namely maintainer scripts, diversions, overwrite
protection, ... are not supported.
.PP
\fBdpkg-cross\fR is intended to make it easier for you to keep your
cross compiling libraries up-to-date, as it works directly on Debian
packages. It saves you copying the libs and headers from a machine
with your target architecture, or extracting them via dpkg-deb
--fsys-tarfile.
.PP
\fBdpkg-cross\fR also collects and install the .shlibs files in
``-dev'' packages, which are needed by \fBdpkg-shlibdeps\fR.
.PP
\fBdpkg-cross\fR works in the directories defined in
/etc/dpkg/cross-compile; see
.BR cross\-compile (5)
for more information.
.SH OPTIONS
The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-arch \fIarchitecture
Install for architecture \fIarchitecture\fR. This option is mandatory.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-install
Install Debian packages (\fB.deb\fR) named on the command line. Only
files in the directories /lib, /usr/lib, /usr/X11R6/lib, /usr/include,
and /usr/X11R6/include are extracted, since only they can be
relevant for cross compiling. In the lib directories, also no
subdirectories are extracted.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-remove
Remove the cross compiling packages named on the command line.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-status
Print status of the named packages: either not installed, or installed
in which version.
