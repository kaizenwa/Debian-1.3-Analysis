	* New package, bsdmainutils. Version starts at 3.0 to strengthen
	  connection with bsdutils package. This fixes Bug#2141.

	* Based on bsdutils-2.0-2

	* Deleted:
	    /bin/kill
	    /usr/bin/logger
	    /usr/bin/mesg
	    /usr/bin/renice
	    /usr/bin/script
	    /usr/bin/wall
	    /usr/sbin/chroot
	  These are left in bsdutils (other than /usr/bin/mesg, which has
	  moved to sysvinit). (Bug#2602 and #2601)

	* Added 'architecture' control field (Bug#2616)

	* removed 'pre-depends' stuff. Use just plain 'depends' line.

	* mesg from sysvinit fixes Bug#2317.

	* banner.c: register the program name to fix Bug#2559.
