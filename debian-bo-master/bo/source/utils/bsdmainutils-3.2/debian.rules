# To make the binary distribution package, the ``Debianized'' source package
# and the context diff to the original package, type `./debian.rules dist'.
# Make sure that `debian.rules' is executable before the final distribution
# is made.
#
# Invoke each target with `./debian.rules <target>'.  All targets should be
# invoked with the package root as the current directory.
#
# The `binary' target must be run as root, as it needs to install files with
# specific ownerships.  The `diff' target assumes that you have the original
# source package available, unpacked, in ../$(p)-$(v).orig, or that you have
# the previous revision of the ``Debianized'' source package and context diff
# in the parent directory.

# The name of the package (for example, `emacs').
