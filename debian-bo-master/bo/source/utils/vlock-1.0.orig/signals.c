/* RCS log:
 * $Log: signals.c,v $
 * Revision 1.9  1996/05/17 02:50:28  johnsonm
 * include path changes
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1994/07/03 13:09:18  johnsonm
 * Added support for setting the signal mask with or without saving the
 *   old mask.
 * Added handling SIGTSTP back in; apparantly it is important in some cases.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1994/07/03  12:01:53  johnsonm
 * Added SIGINT handling so ctrl-break won't kill it.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1994/03/23  17:01:25  johnsonm
 * Fixed SIGQUIT bug.
 * Added support for non-vt ttys.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1994/03/19  14:28:18  johnsonm
 * Removed support for silly two-process idea.  signal mask no longer
 * inverse of what I want.  (I may have fixed this in an earlier
 * version, and forgotten to log it.)
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1994/03/16  20:11:04  johnsonm
 * It mostly works -- child can still be killed by sigchld, which
 * propogates to parent, which kills lock program.  However, locking
 * all VC's does work if there is no other way to log on...
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1994/03/15  18:27:33  johnsonm
 * Added a few more signals, in preparation for two-process model.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/03/13  17:27:44  johnsonm
 * Now using SIGUSR{1,2} correctly with release_vt() and acquire_vt() to
 * keep from switching VC's.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/03/13  16:28:16  johnsonm
 * Initial revision
