       vvlloocckk is a program to lock one or  more  sessions  on  the
       Linux  console.   This  is  especially  useful  for  Linux
       machines which have multiple users with access to the con-
       sole.  One user may lock his or her session(s) while still
       allowing other users to use the system  on  other  virtual
       consoles.   If  desired,  the entire console may be locked
       and virtual console switching disabled.

       By default, only  the  current  VC  (virtual  console)  is
       locked.   With the --aa,,--aallll option all VCs are locked.  The
       locked VCs cannot be unlocked without the invoker's  pass-
       word  or the root password.  The root password will always
       be able to unlock any or all sessions.  And, for the para-
       noid,  vlock  makes  it  a  trying  experience  for  those
       attempting to guess the password, so  unauthorized  access
       to session(s) is highly unlikely.

       Please  note  that  it  is entirely possible to completely
       lock yourself out of the console with the --aa,,----aallll  option
       if you cannot remember your password!  Unless you are able
       to kill vlock by logging in remotely via a serial terminal
       or  network,  a hard reset is the only method of ``unlock-
       ing'' the display.

       vvlloocckk works  for  console  sessions  primarily.   However,
       there  is  support for trying to lock non-console sessions
       as well, but that support has not been well-tested..
