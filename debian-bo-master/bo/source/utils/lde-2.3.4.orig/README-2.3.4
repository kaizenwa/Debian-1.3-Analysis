Release 2.3.3 never made it to sunsite.  Release
2.3.4 with a working grep-inode script.

Release (2.3.3) is no different than 2.3.2,
but hopefully it will untar.

Release 2.3.2:

I'm making this release (2.3.2) to fix a bug in
the malloc for the log_error() function.

This release also includes a few new features/fixes:

* 'N' will take you to the next block in the chain in
  block or directory mode
* The size of the file/device is now correct for 
  partitions accessed without a recognized filesystem.
* If the device cannot be opened read-write, attempt
  to open it read-only before quitting
* Fixed grep-inode script so that it works like the
  documentation says it should
* Support for triple indirect blocks!!  This is _NOT_
  compiled in by default, it was not supposed to be 
  added until version 2.4.  To include it, you must add
  -DBETA_CODE to the CFLAGS definition in the makefile.
  There is a precompiled static ELF binary available
  (lde-2.3.2+Beta.bin.tar.gz).

Features/fixes from 2.3 to 2.3.1:

* warn() changed to lde_warn() [New libc has builtin warn()]
* can now edit dates in inode mode without calculating the
  number of seconds since January 1, 1970.  The only format
  it doesn't like is that of ctime() with the time listed
  between the month and year.
* fix ext2 buffer overflow for small filesystems.
