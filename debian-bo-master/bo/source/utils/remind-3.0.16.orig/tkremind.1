.SH NAME
tkremind \- graphical front-end to Remind calendar program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tkremind \fR[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIread_file\fR] [\fIwrite_file\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTkRemind\fR is a graphical front-end to the \fBRemind\fR program.
It provides a friendly graphical interface which allows you to view
your calendar and add reminders without learning the syntax of \fBRemind\fR.
Although not all of \fBRemind\fR's features are available with \fBTkRemind\fR,
\fBTkRemind\fR gives you an opportunity to edit the reminder commands which
it creates.  This allows you to learn \fBRemind\fR's syntax and then add
extra features as you become a more sophisticated \fBRemind\fR programmer.

\fBTkRemind\fR is written in TCL, and requires tcl version 7.4 and tk
version 4.0.  It also requires a \fBwish\fR binary.  \fBTkRemind\fR runs
only under UNIX, and requires X-Windows.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBTkRemind\fR itself has no options.  However, it passes certain options
on to \fBRemind\fR.  The options it passes are
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-g\fR, \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-i\fR and \fB\-m\fR.
See the \fBRemind\fR man page for details about the options.

\fIRead_file\fR is the file from which \fBTkRemind\fR reads reminders.
It is in standard \fBRemind\fR format.  \fIWrite_file\fR is the file
to which \fBTkRemind\fR writes reminders which you add using the GUI.
If \fIRead_file\fR is omitted, it defaults to \fB$HOME/.reminders\fR.
If \fIWrite_file\fR is omitted, it defaults to \fIRead_file\fR.

You may wish to have a different \fIWrite_file\fR from \fIRead_file\fR if
you want to collect all of \fBTkRemind\fR's reminders in one place.  Suppose
your main file is \fI$HOME/.reminders\fR and you want \fBTkRemind\fR to put
its reminders in \fI$HOME/.tkreminders\fR.  In \fI$HOME/.reminders\fR,
include the line:
.PP
.nf
	INCLUDE [getenv("HOME")]/.tkreminders
.fi
.PP

.SH THE CALENDAR WINDOW
When you start \fBTkRemind\fR, it displays a calendar for the current
month, with today's date highlighted.  Reminders are filled into each
box on the calendar.  If a box contains many reminders, you can scroll
it up and down by dragging mouse button 2 in the box.  Note that there
is no specific indication of an over-full box; you'll just have to
notice that the box appears completely full.

.SH NAVIGATING
To change to the previous or next month, click the \fBPrevious
Month\fR or \fBNext Month\fR button, respectively.  To change back to
the current month, click \fBToday\fR.  To go to a specific month,
click \fBGo To Date...\fR.  This pops up a dialog box which allows you
to select a month and enter a year.  Once you've done this, click
\fBGo\fR to go to the date, or \fBCancel\fR to cancel.

To exit \fBTkRemind\fR, click \fBQuit\fR.  By default, TkRemind
does not ask for confirmation.  If it has been configured
to ask for confirmation, click \fBYes\fR in the dialog box which pops up.

.SH ADDING REMINDERS
To add a reminder, click button 1 in any day number in the calendar.
The \fBAdd Reminder...\fR dialog will pop up, with values preselected for
the day you clicked.

The dialog has six basic groups of controls.  The first three lines
select one of three types of reminders.  Choose the type of reminder
with the radio buttons, and choose the values of the days, months, and
years by selecting values from pull-down menus.  The pull-down menus
appear when you click the raised value buttons.

The next control specifies an expiry date for the reminder.  Select
the check button to enable an expiry date, and fill in the values
using pull pull-down menus.

The third control specifes how much advance notice you want (if any),
and whether or not weekends and holidays are counted when computing advance
notice.

The fourth control specifies which days \fBRemind\fR considers
as part of the weekend.  This can affect the interpretation of "weekday"
in the second and third types of reminders.

The fifth control associates a time with the reminder.
You can also specify advance notice, possibly repeating.

The sixth control specifies what \fBRemind\fR should do if a reminder
falls on a holiday or weekend.

Enter the body of the reminder into the \fBBody:\fR text entry.

To add the reminder to the reminder file, click \fBAdd to reminder file\fR.
To close the dialog without adding the reminder to the file, click
\fBCancel\fR.  To preview the reminder, click \fBPreview reminder\fR.
This pops up the \fBPreview reminder\fR dialog box.

.SH PREVIEWING REMINDERS
The \fBPreview reminder\fR dialog box is an excellent way to learn
\fBRemind\fR.  It displays the \fBRemind\fR command which realizes the
reminder you entered using the \fBAdd Reminder...\fR dialog.  You can
edit the reminder, thereby gaining access to advanced features of
\fBRemind\fR.  You can also use it simply to play around and discover
\fBRemind\fR's idioms for expressing different types of reminders.

.SH PRINTING
To print the current month's calender, click \fBPrint...\fR on the
main calendar window.  This brings up the print dialog.  Printing
either produces a PostScript file or sends PostScript to a UNIX command.

Select the print destination by choosing either \fBTo file:\fR or
\fBTo command:\fR in the print dialog.  Press \fBBrowse...\fR to bring
up a file browser.  In the file browser, you can enter a filename in
the text entry, double-click on a filename in the listbox, or
double-click on a directory to navigate the file system.  You can also
type the first few characters of a file name in the text entry box and
press space to complete the name to the first matching entry.

The \fBMatch:\fR box contains a filename wildcard which filters files
in the listbox.  You can change the filter and press enter to rescan
the directory.

Select the appropriate paper size and orientation.  Activate
\fBFill page\fR if you want the calendar to fill the page.  This should
be the normal case unless you have many reminders in a particular
day.  (See the \fBRem2PS\fR documentation.)

Finally, click \fBPrint\fR to print or \fBCancel\fR to cancel.
Note that during printing, \fBRemind\fR is \fInot\fR called with
the \fB-itkremind=1\fR option, because it is operated in normal
PostScript-producing mode.

.SH ODDS AND ENDS
\fBTkRemind\fR performs some basic consistency checks when you add or
preview a reminder.  However, if you edit a reminder in the previewer,
\fBTkRemind\fR does \fInot\fR check the edited reminder.  You can
produce illegal reminders which may cause problems.  (This is one good
reason to isolate \fBTkRemind\fR's reminders in a separate file.)

\fBTkRemind\fR does \fInot\fR check the body of the reminder in any
way.  You can use the normal \fBRemind\fR substitution sequences in
the body.  Furthermore, if you use expression-pasting in the body,
\fBTkRemind\fR does \fInot\fR validate the expressions.

When \fBTkRemind\fR invokes \fBRemind\fR, it supplies the option:
.PP
.nf
	-itkremind=1
.fi
.PP
on the command line.  So, in your \fBRemind\fR file, you can include:
.PP
.nf
	IF defined("tkremind")
		# Then I'm probably being invoked by TkRemind
	ENDIF
.fi
.PP
You can use this to activate certain reminders in different ways
for \fBTkRemind\fR (for example).
