# Run it AFTER MIDNIGHT so that date is correct!
# On our system, we have the following in our crontab:
# 05 5 * * * /usr/share/lib/remind/remind-all > /dev/null 2>&1

# This script must be run by root.  The -u option MUST be supplied
# to Remind, or a severe security hole will exist.  Note that Remind
# must be compiled to support the -u option for this script to work.
# Also, the -r and -q options must be used.

# The following line gets a list of users for systems using SUN's
# NIS service:
set USERS  = `ypcat passwd | awk -F: '{print $1}'`

# The following line gets a list of users by examining /etc/passwd:
# set USERS = `awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd`

# If neither of the above methods works, you must come up with some
# way of getting a list of users on the system

# Set the following variables as appropriate for your system
set REMIND = /usr/local/bin/remind
set MAIL   = /usr/ucb/mail
