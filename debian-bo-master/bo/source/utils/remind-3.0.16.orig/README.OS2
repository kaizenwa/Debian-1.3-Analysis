REMIND version 3.0 for OS/2

This file contains instructions for compiling Remind under OS/2 with
Eberhard Mattes' emx/gcc compiler and with the Microsoft C compiler.
There are a number of targets in Makefile.os2, including OS/2-only 
versions and bound versions (programs which run under OS/2 and DOS).

Note that there is also support for OS/2 using the Borland C 
compiler--see the file README.BCC for details.

REMIND is a sophisticated alarm/calendar program.  Details are given
in the man page, "remind.1".

1 - Read the file COPYRIGHT.  (This may be called COPYRIGH on your
    MS-DOS system.)

2 - To compile Remind for OS/2, you must use the Microsoft C compiler
    or emx/gcc. You must also have a decent version of 'make', such 
    as dmake or GNU make.

3 - Examine the file config.h and adjust parameters as needed

4 - Examine the file Makefile.os2 and adjust parameters as needed.

5 - Type:

	make -f Makefile.os2

to see a list of targets. For example, 

	make -f Makefile.os2 emx

will build a 32-bit emx version which runs under OS/2 2.x and DOS.

The file "defs.rem" has some sample Remind definitions and commands,
as well as U.S. and Jewish holidays.

NOTE that I do not have access to an OS/2 system, so support for this
system may not be as good as I'd like.

OS/2 support is courtesy of Russ Herman <rwh@gov.on.ca>, Norman Walsh 
<norm@ora.com>, and Darrel Hankerson <hankedr@mail.auburn.edu>. 
However, if you have problems, please contact me.

OTHER LANGUAGE SUPPORT

Remind has support for languages other than English.  See the file
"lang.h" for details.  The language support may vary - you can change
only the substitution filter, or you can translate all of the usage
instructions and error messages as well.  See "french.h" for an
example of the latter.

If you add support for a non-English language, Remind will accept both the
English and non-English names of months and weekdays in an input script.
However, you should not rely on this feature if you want to write portable
Remind scripts.

At a minimum, you should support month and day names in the foreign
language, and should modify the substitution filter appropriately.
If you are truly diligent, you can translate usage and error messages
too.

Take a look at the files "english.h" and "german.h" if you want to add
support for your favourite language.  If you do add another language
to Remind, please let me know!  Here are the basic guidelines:

- Your language file should be called "lxxx.h", where lxxx is the first 8
characters of the ENGLISH name of your language.

- You should define L_LANGNAME to be the full English name of your language,
  with the first letter capitalized and the rest lower-case.

RELEASE NOTES -- miscellaneous info that couldn't go anywhere else!

1. POPUP REMINDERS

If you define the symbol OS2_POPUP in the OS/2 Makefile, you get
"full-screen popups" (as implemented by Russ Herman) for all MSG-
and MSF-type reminders.  You may or may not like this feature.

One way of implementing popup reminders is to get the program
"pmpopup.exe" from ftp-os2.cdrom.com, and using Remind with the
'-k' option as follows from C:\STARTUP.CMD:

start /pm /inv /n remind "-kstart pmpopup %%s" remfile

Alternatively, if you have the Vrexx package, you can use this
procedure suggested by Norman Walsh:

Start remind like this in C:\STARTUP.CMD:

start /pm /inv /n \bin\remind -faz "-kstart popupmsg %%s" .reminders

The popups are done by POPUPMSG.CMD which looks like this:

-------------- Cut Here ---------- Cut Here ---------- Cut Here --------
/* PopUpMsg */

'@echo off'

parse arg theargs
if theargs = "" then
  theargs = "Empty message"

call RxFuncAdd 'VInit', 'VREXX', 'VINIT'
initcode = VInit()
if initcode = 'ERROR' then signal CLEANUP

signal on failure name CLEANUP
signal on halt name CLEANUP
signal on syntax name CLEANUP

/* example VMsgBox call */

msg.0 = 1
msg.1 = theargs

call VDialogPos 50, 50
call VMsgBox 'Popup Message', msg, 1

/* end of CMD file */

CLEANUP:
   call VExit

exit
-------------- Cut Here ---------- Cut Here ---------- Cut Here --------
