REMIND version 3.0.16 for QDOS / SMSQ

REMIND is a sophisticated alarm/calendar program.  Details are given
in the documentation file, "remind_doc" (QUILL format).
[Note from David Skoll -- I was not sent the file `remind_doc', so
 you're on your own here.  You'll have to use the UNIX man pages.]

1 - Read the file COPYRIGHT.

2 - Do NOT redistribute Remind WITHOUT the sources!

3 - Examine the Makefile and change any parameters which need to be
    changed for your system.  (The makefile for QDOS / SMSQ is
    makefile_QDOS).

4 - Examine the file config_h and adjust parameters as needed

5 - Examine lang_h and choose the language you want Remind to use.
    There has no effort been put in making the language modules working
    on the QL.  You'll have to adjust the files for yourself to get
    them working (umlauts etc).

6 - Execute "make;'-fMakefile_QDOS'".  Be sure, that your DATA_DEFAULT
    directory is the directory where the remind source files are
    placed.

7 - There is an acceptance test for other systems.  If you want to
    test remind on your QDOS / SMSQ system execute the following
    commands from your command line:
       SETENV "TEST_GETENV=foo bar baz"
       ex datad$&'remind';'-e -dxte test_rem 16 feb 1991 > test_out'
       ex diff;'test_out test_cmp >test_diff'
    Then check the output of diff.  You will find lots of differences.
    If there are other than differences in the filename
    (supplied test-result: ./test.rem, QDOS result: test_rem) and
    in the ostype (supplied: UNIX, QDOS: QDOS / SMSQ) Remind does
    not work correctly.


The file "defs_rem" has some sample Remind definitions and commands,
as well as U.S. and Jewish holidays.  You should delete the definitions
for ANSI colours as the QL does not support the ANSI standard.


OTHER LANGUAGE SUPPORT

Remind has support for languages other than English.  See the file
"lang_h" for details.  The language support may vary - you can change
only the substitution filter, or you can translate all of the usage
instructions and error messages as well.  See "french_h" for an
example of the latter.

If you add support for a non-English language, Remind will accept both the
English and non-English names of months and weekdays in an input script.
However, you should not rely on this feature if you want to write portable
Remind scripts.

At a minimum, you should support month and day names in the foreign
language, and should modify the substitution filter appropriately.
If you are truly diligent, you can translate usage and error messages
too.

Take a look at the files "english_h" and "german_h" if you want to add
support for your favourite language.  If you do add another language
to Remind, please let me know!  Here are the basic guidelines:

- Your language file should be called "lxxx_h", where lxxx is the first 8
  characters of the ENGLISH name of your language.

- Your language file should define L_LANGNAME to be the full English
  name of your language, with the first letter capitalized and the rest
  lower-case.

RELEASE NOTES -- miscellaneous info that couldn't go anywhere else!

The QDOS / SMSQ version does not support the enhanced features of
the UNIX and/or OS/2 versions.

I had some problems with the sunrise() and sunset() functions,
but didn't examine it.

I've ported Remind on a SMSQ/SGC system.  It should work on other
systems without problems.  The compiler used was C68 v4.14c.

Remind should work with each QL or compatible with 512K or more RAM.
It'll however NOT work on a standard QL due to it's code size.

Any problems with the QDOS / SMSQ versions should be sent to:
