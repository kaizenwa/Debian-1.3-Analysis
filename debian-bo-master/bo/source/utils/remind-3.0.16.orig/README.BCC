REMIND version 3.0 for Borland C++

1 - Read the file COPYRIGHT.  (This may be called COPYRIGH on your
    MS-DOS system.)

2 - You must use the Borland C++ OS/2 or MSDOS/Windows compiler.

3 - Examine the file config.h and adjust parameters as needed

4 - Examine the file makefile.bcc and adjust parameters as needed.

5 - Type:

	make -f makefile.bcc

This will make 'remind.exe' and 'rem2ps.exe' in the ..\os2-ex or ..\msdos-ex
directories.

The file "defs.rem" has some sample Remind definitions and commands,
as well as U.S. and Jewish holidays.

NOTE that I do not have access to an OS/2 system, so support for this
system may not be as good as I'd like.

OS/2 support is courtesy of Russ Herman <rwh@gov.on.ca>, Norman Walsh 
<norm@ora.com>, and Darrel Hankerson <hankedr@mail.auburn.edu>. 
However, if you have problems, please contact me.

OTHER LANGUAGE SUPPORT

Remind has support for languages other than English.  See the file
"lang.h" for details.  The language support may vary - you can change
only the substitution filter, or you can translate all of the usage
instructions and error messages as well.  See "french.h" for an
example of the latter.

If you add support for a non-English language, Remind will accept both the
English and non-English names of months and weekdays in an input script.
However, you should not rely on this feature if you want to write portable
Remind scripts.

At a minimum, you should support month and day names in the foreign
language, and should modify the substitution filter appropriately.
If you are truly diligent, you can translate usage and error messages
too.

Take a look at the files "english.h" and "german.h" if you want to add
support for your favourite language.  If you do add another language
to Remind, please let me know!	Here are the basic guidelines:

- Your language file should be called "lxxx.h", where lxxx is the first 8
characters of the ENGLISH name of your language.

- You should define L_LANGNAME to be the full English name of your language,
  with the first letter capitalized and the rest lower-case.
