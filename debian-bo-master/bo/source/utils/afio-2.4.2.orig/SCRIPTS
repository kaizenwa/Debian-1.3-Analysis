Afio has far too many options to be used directly from the command
line, it is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup
script.


1) Using existing scripts.

There are currently two `large' backup scripts using afio that I know
of.  [Note added in 1996: additional scripts that use afio have
appeared, search the Linux Software Map, a Linux ftp site, or a Linux
CD-ROM.]

Apart from incorporating the functions of afio, both scripts offer
some general `administrative structure' like backup volumes, file
exclusion, log files and incremental backup facilities.

Both are easy to set up and use.  They have extensive documentation
that covers the whole backup process.

The main difference between the two scripts is the intended backup
device.

1a)  tob: Tape Oriented Backup

These scripts are mainly intended for use with tape drives.  They also
contain code for making backups over a network.

Options to tob are given on the command line.  It can run as an
at-job.

Title:          tob: Tape Oriented Backup
Version:        0.02
Entered-date:   January 1995
Description:    The tob package presents a shell-script to create and maintain
                full or differential backups. Backups are defined by a
                `volume', listings of backups are kept. Contains definition
                files for tar-based or afio-based backups (compressed or not)
                and for afio-based backups to a remote device.

The `tob' package replaces the `backup' package by the same
author, the `backup' package are no longer supported.


1b) tbackup -- general backup system for Linux

These scripts are mainly intended for use with floppy drives, but tape
drives are also supported. The afio floppy handling routines are not
used, tbackup provides its own floppy handling which is more user
friendly and has much better error detection and recovery.

Tbackup gets its options through an interactive dialog with the user.
It tries to generate clear error and warning messages for every
possible user and system error.

2) Writing your own backup script. (Or adapting an existing one.)

Aside from the manual page, the files README.afio, README.linux,
and script[12]/* provide information for script writers.

Two sample backup scripts are included with this afio release.  The
material in script1/ is written by Andrew Stevens, that in script2/ by
Dave Gymer.  Both scripts will probably need some editing to run on
your configuration.

Sample scripts for backups with pgp encryption are included in
script3/.  There were contributed by Karsten Ballueder.
