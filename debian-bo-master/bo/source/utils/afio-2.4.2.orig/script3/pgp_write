# This example shows how to configure afio to write pgp encrypted archives.
#
# Setting the PGPPASS environment variable is unsafe.
# 
# If you are using bash, you can use the input redirection by opening a second
# input stream linked to a file containing your pass phrase. Be careful about
# that file's permissions!
#
# working with any shell, but unsafe:
#
#export PGPPASS="your pass phrase"
#find * | afio -ov -Z -U -P "pgp" -Q "-fe" -Q "user_id_for_encryption" -Q "y" archive_file
#
# better, only working with bash(?):
#
export PGPPASSFD=3
(find * | afio -ov -Z -U -P "pgp" -Q "-fe" -Q "user_id_for_encryption" archive_file ) 3<passphrasefile
