To install afio, just type

make
make install

This compiles afio, installs the binary in /usr/bin, and the manual page
in /usr/man/man1.

------------------------------

Afio has far too many options to be used directly from the command
line, it is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup script.

See the file SCRIPTS for more information on backup scripts that use
afio.

See the file PORTING for information on compiling afio on non-Linux
machines.
