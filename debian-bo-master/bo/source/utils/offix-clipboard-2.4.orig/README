To install in /usr/local/:
--------------------------
* type ./configure (or ./configure --prefix=/some/where/else)
* type make
* type make install
* strip the binaries if you want: 
    strip /usr/local/bin/clipboard (or strip /some/where/else/bin/clipboard)
* remove the sources 

Configure extra options:
------------------------
use these if configure is not able to find your libXpm	
  --with-xpm-inc=value    where to find xpm include
  --with-xpm-lib=value    where to find xpm library

Notes: 
------
	1) You probably need gcc and X11R6 to compile. It may be necessary 
to use GNU make.

=============================================================================
CLIPBOARD 1.0
=============================================================================

Just a patch to the standard xclipboard program. You can drop things on
the clipboard window and they will be inserted into the current clipboard.

TO DO LIST
----------
* Icon drop. It's a very easy task, I just don't know what should be
  the icon drop behaviour - open a new clipboard (=new button) or
  add to the current one?
