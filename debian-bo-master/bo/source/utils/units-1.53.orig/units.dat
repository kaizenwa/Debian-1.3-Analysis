# In vacuum science and some other applications, gas flow is measured
# as the product of volumetric flow and pressure.   This is useful
# because it makes  it easy to compare with the flow at standard
# pressure  (one atmosphere).  It also directly relates  to the number
# of gas  molecules per unit time, and hence to the mass flow if the
# molecular mass is known.
