Version 2.4.13 change by J"org Weule at 1996 Dez 1. :
              - Added support for long filenames. Long filenames
                are handled with "tar cv ..." and dds2index to create
                the index table. "tar xv ..." is not writing an index
                dds2tar can handle correct with long file names.
                A filename is called long, if it has more than 99 characters.
              - Fixed problems matching the index with the header records
		of the tape. I made the check more robust.
Version 2.4.12 change by J"org Weule at 1996 Mar 29. :
              - fixed the strncmp calls inside dds2tar.c - thanks to
                Goncal Badenes <badenes@imec.be> for the bug fix.
              - fixed dds_extract.c --
                tar cfv and tar vft are reporting soft _and_ hard links
                in a different style. Hard links may not confuse the
                header test in dds_extract.
                Goncal Badenes <badenes@imec.be> for the bug fix.
              - Added a test with an unpatched tar into dds2tar-test.sh.

Version 2.4.11 change by J"org Weule at 1996 Mar 10. :
              - Added a warning: You have to be root to change compression.
              - Added dds-dd, a tool to read a tape with unknown block size.

Version 2.4.10 change by J"org Weule at 1996 Feb 5. :
              - Fixed my tar-patch. Sorry for the mistake.

Version 2.4.10 change by J"org Weule at 1996 Jan 4. :
              - Changed the counter --totals with tar-1.11.8-patch to
                'long long int' to use very large archives.
		Added the calculation of the throuput on --totals.
              - Fixed the dds2tar-test.sh script.
              - Test for elf compatibility.

Version 2.4.9 change by J"org Weule at 1995 Feb 4. :
              - Added the action filename to mt-dds.

Version 2.4.8 change by J"org Weule at 1995 Feb 4. :
              - Added option 'date <timestammp>' to mt-dds.
              - Fixed the code for 'mt-dds ts'
              - tar-1.11.2.patch:
                Added %T to expand the record-filename with the timestamp.

Version 2.4.7 change by J"org Weule at 1995 Feb 2. :
              - Added a patch to tar (support for sparse file on Linux boxes).
              - dds_bsr() inserted to dds_tape.c and used by mt-dds (label).
                A small change of ddstool was necessary

Version 2.4.6 change by J"org Weule at 1995 Jan 29. :
              - added the option ts to mt-dds.
              - added the option date to mt-dds.
              - added teh script 'ddstool' to make some things easier.
              - fixed the handling of softlinks in conjunction with
                tar index file -- dds2tar ended with FATAL error in
                this case.
              - added a tool tar2tar.

Version 2.4.5 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Dez 22. :
              - On non HP-DDS devices, teh record number is read from
                the device before any block is read.
              - Added the option --quick to skip reading of parent directories.

Version 2.4.4 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Dez 3. :

Version 2.4.3 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Nov 21. :
              - Added a test script with index files to the package.
              - Added --body to dds2tar.
              - Added label to mt-dds.

Version 2.4.2 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Nov 21. :
              - Fixed some bugs of dds_extract.c.

Version 2.4.1 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Nov 7. :
              - Andreas Bagge was kind enought to report a bug:
                Long files (>1MB) are shifting the name field in the tar
                listing to the right. dds_extract.c is now able to detect
                this.
              - I moved the check about the line '-end- ...' to the begining
                of the loop inside dds_extract.c.
              - Fixed a bug of mt-dds. tell was not working at all.
              - Tried to include code to set the right buffer size
                in order to allow the change of the buffer of the kernel.
                The size of the internal buffer can be set by the -b option
                (command line or environment) or is extracted from the
                tar record file if possible. The internal buffer should be
                large enought to hold one tape block.
              - As Andreas Bagge pointed out, a parameter to fnmatch()
                serves for matching filenames by giving the directory
                entry. The matching is now done similar to tar.
              - A workaround lets you create an index of tapes created
                with 'tar -b 256 ...' on SunOS. You may have to increase
                the default buffer size (ST_BUFFER_BLOCKS) inside the
                Makefile to 64 or bigger and the kernel
                (/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/st.c) in that case. On SunOS I
                recommend a block size smaller or equal than 64 (-b option of
                tar = 32Kb). You have also to increase the buffer size
                of your kernel (/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/st.c).
                The default buffer size of the kernel is the maximal block
                size of tape block which can be read is 32kB.
              - The option --body is included.

Version 2.4.0 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 28. :
              - Fnmatch() was found inside clib (gclib). Code deleted.

Version 2.3.9 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 16. :
              - Reading some options from the environment, e.g. -z, -s, -b.

Version 2.3.8 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 15. :
              - Added a check for the header at dds2index.
                If it's not a tar header, a skip is performed.

Version 2.3.7 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 13. :
              - changed the tar-1.11.2 patch to get the date of archiving
                in the listing (bug fix). The date of the label record is
                printed correct now while creating the archive.
              - New options --z and --no-compress are included.
              - The environment variable DDS2TAR should contain the string
                --compress to set this option to default.
              - The default DEVICE is now /dev/rmt0 like tar.

Version 2.3.6 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 11. :
              - A lot of header files are created. Some source files
                are divided into two.
              - As Andreas Bagge pointed out, main(argc,argv,envp) is not
                ANSI-C code. I deleted envp for that reason, but this still
                works.
              - I changed the interface to open child processes. Now you
                find a nice interface at "zf-cre-open.c". You may open
                a pipe to the child process for reading or writing on a
                file number of your choice, e.g. 0 or 1 ('creopen()').
                (Writing stderr to a child process is not supported.)
                The function 'zfopen()' opens a file for reading or writing
                with transparent (de)compression. This may also be of interest
                for other programs.

Version 2.3.5 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 11. :
              - Added -fwritable-strings to the compiler options
                Constant strings are declared const by hand.

Version 2.3.4 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 10. :
              - Inserted a lot of const declarations and fixed a bug
                inside an experimental function.
              - Added the postscript versions of the manual pages to the
                distribution.

Version 2.3.3 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 10. :
              - No access to tape with -l.
              - Inserted some lines for security.
                If the name of the program is mt-dds, nothing is
                written on the disk by the program.

Version 2.3.2 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 10. :
              - bug fix inside dds_extract.c.

Version 2.3.1 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 9. :
              - All header record are checked for the filename.
              - New option -l is included to check the index file for the
                selected matches. The strings are written to stdout and no
                pipeing to tar should be done.
              - option --extract included.

Version 2.3.0 change by J"org Weule at 1994 Oct 9. :
              - Added a check inside dds2tar. Now some header records of the
                tar files to extract are checked for the expected file name.
                dds2tar should stop if you have inserted the wrong tape.
              - I inserted a routine to open stdout for a child process or
                a file. Andreas Bagge gave me some source to create the
                included functions.
              - A funktion tar-dds is added to write a tool like tar.
                The tool is not ready yet.
              - Added background information to the man page of dds2tar.
                The lines are based on a text from Andreas Bagge.

Version 2.2.0 change by J"org Weule:
              I have deleted a lot of options to make the software easier to use.
              The scan of the index file is very robust.

              Hope you agree that dds2tar should be a small tool, simple to
              use and with as less parameters as possible. That's why I have
              deleted old and obsolete parameters for the costs that you may
              have to change some scripts.

Version 2.1.2 Index lines strings with '#' are ignored.
              mt-dds can be used to set the tape position of the tape
                for the next run of dds2tar. This may be convenient for
                shell scripts.

Version 2.1.1 The recfile (-R) can also be an index-file created by dds2index.
              The option -t of dds2tar is obsolete.
              Help is written to stdout.

Version 2.1.0 made some options obsolete.

Version 2.0.1 is a package with a patch to tar-1.11.2.

Version 2.0.0 is a package of three programs, to make it easier to use.
              A lot of options of dds2tar-1.1.3 are included.
              So it is easy to switch to this new version.
