Hiya,

This is tob, Tape Oriented Backup. Hope it's useful to you. Please take a look 
at doc/tob.ps.gz: uncompress the file and print it if you have LaTeX /
Ghostscript. If you don't, uncompress doc/tob.txt.gz and read that, it's the
same information but in plain ascii. Read that documentation _carefully_
before trying to use tob.

If you really get stuck, just mail me --
Karel Kubat (karel@icce.rug.nl).
