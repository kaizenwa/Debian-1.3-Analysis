To install in /usr/local/:
--------------------------
* type ./configure (or ./configure --prefix=/some/where/else)
* type make
* type make install
* strip the binaries if you want: 
    strip /usr/local/bin/files (or strip /some/where/else/bin/file)
* remove the sources 

Configure extra options:
------------------------
use these if configure is not able to find your libXpm	
  --with-xpm-inc=value    where to find xpm include
  --with-xpm-lib=value    where to find xpm library
these are Files specific options
  --with-magic-headers    identify file types by magic headers

Notes: 
------
	1) You probably need gcc and X11R6 to compile. It may be necessary 
to use GNU make.

=============================================================================
FILES
=============================================================================

This is as file manager based on xfm. It provides virtually all of the
features that you would expect in a file manager -- move around your
directory tree in multiple windows, move, copy or delete files, and launch
programs with simple mouse operations.

There's two options you may find useful to change. Look at the Imakefile in
Files subdirectory. By default, icons dropped on the root window send a
message to a running tycoon in order to create a desktop icon. The other
behavior is to execute that file. "Files" can recognize file types using
magic headers but this is sometimes slow and is off by default.
 
TO DO LIST
----------
* File Finder
* Sort by file type
* A standalone application to configure file types
