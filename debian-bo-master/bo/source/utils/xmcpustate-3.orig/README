- Fixed a small bug in SetShellSize. Inadvertently the minimum size was
  omitted.
- added a patch for s-bsd.c from Danny Backx (u27113@kb.be)
- Recompilation with only libXm statically linked in instead of all of them.
  Resulting binary is a lot more smaller. Please let me know if you have
  any problems running it.
