.TH PROCINFO 8 "1995-04-28" "Release 0.9" "Linux System Manual"

.SH NAME
procinfo \- display system status gathered from /proc

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B procinfo
[
.IR \-fmadDbhv
] [
.IR \-n N
] [
.IR \-F <file>
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B procinfo
gathers some system data from the
.B /proc
directory and prints it nicely formatted on the standard output
device.

The meanings of the fields are as follows:

.TP
.BI Memory:
See the man page for free(1) (preferably the proc-version of free).

.TP
.BI Bootup:
The time the system was booted.

.TP
.BI Load\ average:
The average number of jobs running, followed by the number of runnable
processes and the total number of processes (if your kernel is recent
enough).

.TP
.BI user:
The amount of time spent running jobs in user space.

.TP
.BI nice:
The amount of time spent running niced jobs in user space.

.TP
.BI system:
The amount of time spent running in kernel space.

.TP
.BI idle:
The amount of time spent doing nothing.

.TP
.BI uptime:
The time that the system has been up. The above four should more or
less add up to this one.

.TP
.BI page\ in:
The number of disk block paged into core from disk. (A block is
almost always 1 kilobyte).

.TP
.BI page\ out:
The reverse of the above.

.TP
.BI swap\ in:
The number of pages swapped in.

.TP
.BI swap\ out:
The number of pages swapped out.

.TP
.BI context:
The total number of context switches since bootup.

.TP
.BI disk\ 1\-4:
The number of times your hard disks have been accessed. This will only
work if you have applied the diskstat patch available elsewhere to
your kernel, and if all your hard disks are of the same type (e.g. all
IDE, all SCSI). [I'm not sure to what extend this is still true with
recent kernels, but I don't have a mixed system so I can't check.]

.TP
.BI Interrupts:
This is either a single number for all IRQ channels together if your
kernel is older than version 1.0.5 and you didn't apply the kernel
patch that comes with
.B procinfo,
or two rows of numbers for each IRQ channel if you did apply the patch
or if your kernel is at version 1.0.5 or later.  There are sixteen
different IRQ channels, and their default meanings are as follows:

.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.BI 0
Timer channel 0
.TP
.BI 1
Keyboard
.TP
.BI 2
Cascade for controller 2 (which controls IRQ 8\-15)
.TP
.BI 3
Serial Port 2
.TP
.BI 4
Serial Port 1
.TP
.BI 5
Parallel Port 2
.TP
.BI 6
Floppy Diskette Controller
.TP
.BI 7
Parallel Port 1
.TP
.BI 8
Real-time Clock
.TP
.BI 9
Redirected to IRQ2

.RE

.RS
Note that the meanings of the IRQ channels for parallel ports, serial
ports and those left empty may have been changed depending on your
hardware setup. If that's the case on your machine, you're probably
aware of it. If you're not, upgrade to at least Linux 1.1.43 and let
.B procinfo
enlighten you about who uses what. A `+' following the irq label
means that it uses a fast interrupt handler.
.RE

.TP
.BI Modules:
The modules (loadable device drivers) installed on your machine, with
their sizes in kilobytes. (Only with
.B \-m 
or
.B \-a
option). Deleted modules are marked with a `d', uninitialized
modules with a `u', and modules with a bad state flag with a `b'.

.TP
.BI Character\ and\ Block\ Devices:
All available devices with their major numbers. (Only with
.B \-m
or
.B \-a
option).

.TP
.BI File\ Systems:
All available file systems. (Only with
.B \-m
or
.B \-a
option). Those that do not require an actual device (like procfs
itself) are noted between square brackets.

.SH OPTIONS
.PD 0
.TP
.BI \-f
Run
.B procinfo
continuously full\-screen.

.TP
.BI \-n N
Pause N second between updates. This option implies
.B \-f. It may contain a decimal point.
The default is 5 seconds. When run by root with a pause of 0 seconds,
the program will run at the highest possible priority level.

.TP
.BI \-m
Show info about modules and device drivers instead of CPU and memory stats.

.TP
.BI \-a
Show all information that
.B procinfo
knows how to find.

.TP
.BI \-d
For memory, CPU times, paging, swapping, disk, context and interrupt stats,
display values per second rather than totals. This option implies
.B \-f.

.TP
.BI \-D
Same as
.B \-d,
except that memory stats are displayed as totals.

.TP
.BI \-F <file>
Redirect output to
.B file
(usually a tty).

.TP
.BI \-b
If your kernel is recent enough to display separate read and write
numbers for disk I/O, the -b flag makes 
.B procinfo
display numbers of blocks rather that numbers of I/O requests.

.TP
.BI \-h
Print a brief help message.

.TP
.BI \-v
Print version info.

.SH FILES
.TP
.BI /proc
The proc file system.

.SH BUGS
What, me worry?
