.TH MEMTEST 1
.SH NAME
memtest	\- run memory test diagnostics
.SH SYNOPSIS
memtest	[ memory to test in words ] [ iterations ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmemtest\fP allows a number of words of main memory to be tested with
a number of bit patterns. These bit patterns are all 0's, all 1's or
alternate 0 and 1 fills. 
.SH OPTIONS
NUMBER of words \- Number of words of memory to test
.LP
ITERS           \- Number of iterations to carry out
.SH EXAMPLES
	By default, run the program as files :
.LP 
%memtest
.br
Using default memory size of 1000000 32bit words and 5 passes.
.br
Array a starts at 25344 
.br
Found a total of 0 errors.
.br
.LP
%time memtest 2000000 10
.br
Using a memory size of 2000000 32 bit words (8000000 Bytes) and 10 passes.
.br
Array a starts at 25344
.br
Found a total of 0 errors.
.br
264.0u 15.5s 4:41 99% 0+7948k 3+0io 2pf+0w
.br
.LP
% memtest
.br
Using default memory size of 1000000 32bit words and 5 passes.
.br
Array a starts at 25344
.br
Error at address 426720 subscript 100342, actual(Octal) 25262525252 expected(Octal) 25252525252
.br
Found a total of 1 errors.
.LP
If \fBmemtest\fP is run without the last paramter but with the first
parameter, then it'll run 1 pass only.
.SH "AUTHORS NOTES"
   I wrote this small memory diagnostic after encountering many frequent
problems when running under Linux. Problems encountered were :
.LP
1. Signal 11 being recieved when compiling, especially the kernel.
.br
2. Lots of disk corruption problems, especially after using something like
   find | cpio .
.br
3. X windows crashing often.
.br
4. A generally unstable system.
.LP
  DOS continued to operate ok.
.LP
After a couple of minutes running this diagnostic, I started to see bits
being dropped, and on occasions several bits in a word being dropped.
After examining by BIOS (an AWARD BIOS), I changed the cache speed from
fastest to faster. Reruning the diag for several hours gave no errors.
I now run memtest once an hour from cron, at 4MB and 5 iterations, which
takes 24 secs on a P100.
.LP
