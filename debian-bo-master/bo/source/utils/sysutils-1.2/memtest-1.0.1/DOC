	MEMTEST		- run memory test diagnostics

SYNOPSIS
	MEMTEST		[ memory to test in words ] [ iterations ]

DESCRIPTION
	memtest allows a number of words of main memory to be tested with
a number of bit patterns. These bit patterns are all 0's, all 1's or
alternate 0 and 1 fills. 



OPTIONS
	NUMBER of words   Number of words of memory to test
	ITERS		  Number of iterations to carry out

	%memtest
	Using default memory size of 1000000 32bit words and 5 passes.
 	Array a starts at 25344
	Found a total of 0 errors.

	%time memtest 2000000 10
	Using a memory size of 2000000 32 bit words (8000000 Bytes) and 10 passes.
