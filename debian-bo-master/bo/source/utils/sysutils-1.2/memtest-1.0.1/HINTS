   I wrote this small memory diagnostic after encountering many frequent
problems when running under Linux. Problems encountered were :

1. Signal 11 being recieved when compiling, especially the kernel.
2. Lots of disk corruption problems, especially after using something like
   find | cpio .
3. X windows crashing often.
4. A generally unstable system.

  DOS continued to operate ok.

After a couple of minutes running this diagnostic, I started to see bits
being dropped, and on occasions several bits in a word being dropped.
After examining by BIOS (an AWARD BIOS), I changed the cache speed from
fastest to faster. Reruning the diag for several hours gave no errors.
I now run memtest once an hour from cron, at 4MB and 5 iterations, which
takes 24 secs on a P100.

Could also try setting optimisation levels for gcc in CFLAGS.
