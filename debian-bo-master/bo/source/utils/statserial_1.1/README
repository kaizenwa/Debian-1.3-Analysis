I wrote this program to debug problems with serial ports.

Build it by running 'make', and then run 'make install' as root. Check
the make file to be sure it puts the binary and man page where you
want them.

Also included is phone_log, which demonstrates how to use statserial
from a shell script. It displays a message when the modem detects
ringing.

If you have any problems or suggestions, drop me a line.
