To install in /usr/local/:
--------------------------
* type ./configure (or ./configure --prefix=/some/where/else)
* type make
* type make install
* strip the binaries if you want: 
    strip /usr/local/bin/editor (or strip /some/where/else/bin/editor)
* remove the sources 

Configure extra options:
------------------------
use these if configure is not able to find your libXpm	
  --with-xpm-inc=value    where to find xpm include
  --with-xpm-lib=value    where to find xpm library
these are Editor specific options
  --with-mutekeys         accents in a typewriter-like manner (default)

Notes: 
------
	1) You probably need gcc and X11R6 to compile. It may be necessary 
to use GNU make.

=============================================================================
EDITOR 1.0
=============================================================================

This is an Athena based text editor. It's a patched version of the xed
editor. Like xed, you can perform common actions via user-friendly menus.
You can also drop a file on the "filename" area and the editor will load
this file. If the file is saved, you can also drag from this area to
somewhere else (e.g. to the "printer" program).

If mutekeys are enabled in compile-time, the editor will generate accents in
a typewriter-like manner.

TO DO LIST
----------
* Undo
* Open-look like text behaviour
* Emacs-like keys (configurable ?)
* Color syntax (?) for C/C++ and LaTeX
