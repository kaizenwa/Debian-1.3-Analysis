To install in /usr/local/:
--------------------------
* type ./configure (or ./configure --prefix=/some/where/else)
* type make
* type make install
* strip the binaries if you want: 
    strip /usr/local/bin/trash (or strip /some/where/else/bin/trash)
* remove the sources 

Configure extra options:
------------------------
use these if configure is not able to find your libXpm	
  --with-xpm-inc=value    where to find xpm include
  --with-xpm-lib=value    where to find xpm library

Notes: 
------
	1) You probably need gcc and X11R6 to compile. It may be necessary 
to use GNU make.

=============================================================================
TRASH 1.1
=============================================================================

Trash is a black-hole intended to be used with "files". Every file dropped
on trash will be moved to a temporary hidden directory. If you want, the
"delete all" button will remove the files in trash from your disk forever.
The good things is that the files in trash can be recovered (undeleted).

Suggestion: call it iconic ("trash -ic")


TO DO LIST
----------
* It won't recover a file if there is another with the same name at the
  destination.
* Find a way to clean itself when the window manager shuts down.
