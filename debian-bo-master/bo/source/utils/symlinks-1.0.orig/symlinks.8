.TH SYMLINKS 8 "Sept 1994" "Version 1.0"

.SH NAME
symlinks \- scan/change symbolic links
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B symlinks
[
.B -cdrv
]
dirlist
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BI symlinks
scans directories for symbolic links and lists them on stdout.
Each link is prefixed with a classification of
.B relative,
.B absolute,
.B dangling,
.B messy,
or
.B other_fs.
.PP
.B relative
links are those expressed as paths relative to the directory in which
the links reside, usually independent of the mount point of the filesystem.
.PP
.B absolute
links are those given as an absolute path from the root directory
as indicated by a leading slash (/).
.PP
.B dangling
links are those for which the target of the link does not currently exist.
This commonly occurs for
.B absolute
links when a filesystem is mounted at other than its
customary mount point (such as when the normal root filesystem is
mounted at /mnt after booting from alternative media).
.PP
.B messy
links are links which contain unnecessary slashes or dots in the path.
These are cleaned up as well when
.B -c
is used to convert absolute links to relative.
.PP
.B other_fs
are those whose target currently resides on a different filesystem.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -c 
convert absolute links (within the same filesystem) to relative links.
This permits links to maintain their validity regardless of the mount
point used for the filesystem -- a desirable setup in most cases.
This option also causes any
.B messy
links to be cleaned up.
Links affected by
.B -c
are prefixed with
.B changed
in the output.
.TP
.I -d
causes
.B dangling
links to be removed.
.TP
.I -r 
recursively operate on subdirectories within the same filesystem.
.TP
.I -v 
show all symbolic links.  By default, 
.B relative
links are not shown unless 
.B -v
is specified.
.PP
.SH BUGS
.B symlinks
does not recurse or change links across filesystems.
