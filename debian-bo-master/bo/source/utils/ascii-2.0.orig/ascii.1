.P
This utility accepts command-line strings and tries to interpret them as
one of the above. When it finds a value, it prints \fIall\fR of the names
of the character. If an argument could be interpreted in two or more
ways, names for all the different characters it might be are dumped.
.P
This utility is particularly handy for interpreting cc(1)'s ugly
octal `invalid-character' messages, or when coding anything to do with serial
communications. As a side effect it serves as a handy base-converter
for random 8-bit values.
.P
For correct results, be careful to stringize or quote shell metacharacters
in arguments (especially backslash).
.P
The slang names recognized and printed out are from a rather comprehensive
list that appeared on USENET in early 1990. Mnemonics recognized and printed
include the official ASCII set, some official ISO names (where those differ)
and a few common-use alternatives (such as NL for LF). All comparisons are
case-insensitive, and dashes are mapped to spaces.
