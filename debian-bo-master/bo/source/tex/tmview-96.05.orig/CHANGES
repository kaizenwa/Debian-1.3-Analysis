v95.10  (for a spelling-mistake also called v10.95, sorry)

  This was the first version of tmview and just worked.
  The aim was to have a previewer that goes with S3-cards.
  
  
***************************************************************************
v96.01  

- added text-string-searching
- added commands for measurement
- look for TeX-counter when going to a page
- added a little bit of mouse-support
- added some online-help
- added arbitrary zoom-factors
- removed workaround about S3 related svgalib-bugs, since the
  svgalib-people fixed them in v1.28. Thanks to them !!! 

The last point about the svgalib things was the main reason for
releasing v96.01, since the dvi-reading and -drawing had been ugly
hacks, involving an immense waste of memory and some assembler code.
This was necessary to work around those S3 related bugs.
Dvi-reading and -drawing is now done in C only, at nearly the same 
performance and with less memory used.

On turn that means that v96.01 is NOT the tidied up version I promised
when releasing v95.10. So I keep promising ... 

***************************************************************************
v96.02 (experimental)

- added some of the hyper-tex specials (that is only those, which act
  on the current dvi-file). You may now follow hrefs by mouse-click.
- added support for 640x480x16 modus as compile-time-option.
  usefull on system with standard-vga support only, like
  most notebooks. 
- added a scroll-over-pages-mode, allowing to go through the whole
  dvi-file using only the <n> resp. <cursor-down> key.
- did the memorymanagement now. You may specify at compile-time the
  maximum amount of memory used as LRU-buffer for glyph's. 

***************************************************************************
v96.03 
 
- added bookmarks.
- allow to load more than one file (still viewing only one at a time ...)
- added reading-from / writing-to a startup-file, holding configuration 
  data and the bookmarks.
- got the OS2/PM version a bit more usable ...


***************************************************************************
v96.05 
 
- removed bugs: can now view groff output, tab-key now works
- added kpathsea support (see ./tmview/linux/defsx.h) 
- introduced an experimental version for linux/XFree
