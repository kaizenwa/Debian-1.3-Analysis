MAIL ME ?

You may have some ideas how tmview could become better. You might have
added code to process some of these fancy special command some macro-
packages spread all over the dvi-files they produce. Bug reports or 
even fixes are welcome too. To be shure: 

Any suggetions, comments and opinions are welcome:

qelis@aol.com


NEWEST VERSION ?

Final releases are to be found on CTAN ftp-servers such as "ftp.dante.de"
and on "sunsite.unc.edu".
Since uploading to a ftp-server is some work, for both, me and the
supervisors of the server, this is done not too often. Bugfixes and
minor changes are therefore uploaded on "members.aol.com", my privat
ftp partition. Make the directory "/qelis" current, even if it is NOT
listed by the dir command. You will find there any tmview related stuff in
tar-gz-archieves named "tmvXXXX.tgz" where XXXX is the release number.
