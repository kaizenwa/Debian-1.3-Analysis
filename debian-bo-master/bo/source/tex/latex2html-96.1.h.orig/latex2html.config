# >>>>>>> YOU *MAY* WANT/NEED TO CHANGE SOME OF THESE VARIABLES  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>
# You can run install_test to find out if anything needs changing.

# The following variable sets the default search list of directories for
# latex style files that latex2html should process.  It also defines a
# a list of directories (: separated) which possibly contain TeX and dvips
# inputs.  This variable is overriden by the environment variable
# TEXINPUTS, if it is specified.  Internally, the current working directory,
# "." and ".." are appended to this list of directories.
#
#  IMPORTANT:  In some installations, latex and dvips are really
#  shell scripts which set environment TEXINPUTS (and other variables)
#  to predefined values, then call the real latex and dvips.  If this
#  is true for your installation, then the $TEXINPUTS that latex2html
#  sees will only affect the processing of \input and \include's
#  by latex2html, not the operation of latex and dvips when called
#  by latex2html.  In this case, make sure that the predefined
#  values of TEXINPUTS within the latex and dvips scripts at least
#  contains "." and "..".  Otherwise, latex and dvips will not find
#  inputs from the original source directory when called from a
#  subdirectory contained therein.

# Otherwise, you'll need to try *one* of the following things:
#
#  o Set PK_GENERATION=0 and generate images for your default printer
#  o Download the latest modes.mf from the TeX archive and re-run inimf.
#  o Choose another LOW RESOLUTION screen or printer entry from modes.mf,
#    (preferably with "|blacker|" set to 0.0 and a 1:1 aspect ratio--
#     If you don't have "toshiba", try "epsonlq", "lqlores", "nec", or "NEC")
#     If you try some other mode, remember to update two other things as well:
#
#      1) Change the 'toshiba' in the .dvipsrc file that came with latex2html.
#      2) Put whatever the |pixels_per_inch| value is into $METAFONT_DPI
#         and the .dvipsrc file
#
#   Note: The maximum usable SCALE_FACTOR is determined by this resolution.
#   A higher resolution will take more memory during processing (regardless
#   of SCALE_FACTOR) but will allow higher SCALE_FACTORs.  Do NOT just

# $UP  - points up to the "parent" section
# $NEXT - points to the next section
# $NEXT_GROUP - points to the next "group" section
# $PREVIOUS_GROUP - points to the previous "group" section
# $CONTENTS - points to the contents page if there is one
# $INDEX - points to the index page if there is one
#
# If the corresponding section exists the button will contain an
# active link to that section. If the corresponding section does
# not exist the button will be inactive.
#
# Also for each of the $PREVIOUS $UP $NEXT $NEXT_GROUP and $PREVIOUS_GROUP
# buttons there are equivalent $PREVIOUS_TITLE, $UP_TITLE, etc variables
# which contain the titles of their corresponding sections. 
# Each title is empty if there is no corresponding section.
#
# The subroutine below constructs the navigation panel in each page.
# Feel free to mix and match buttons, titles, your own text, your logos,
# and arbitrary HTML (the "." is the Perl concatenation operator).
