              Questions to be answered in the New FAQ

This file contains lists of questions I have conjured up (or have had
suggested to me) for inclusion in the new FAQ.

I have still to do some work on scanning the content of our news
spool's copy of comp.text.tex, which will probably turn up some more
stuff.

Questions prefixed with a + remain to be done

- font encodings: what does T1 mean to me (Robin)
+ why (and why not) to customise your LaTeX2e
  (e.g., the heated topic of paper sizes)
+ how do I create a subsubsubsection
- what is a dvi file (Carol)
- what is a driver (Carol)
- what are pk files (pxl, gf, ...) Cross ref to question on PS
  problems (Carol -- not pxl, gf -- quite right too)
- LaTeX version numbers (just where did that \varepsilon come from?)
- How to flow text around figures (Robin, from Piet van Oostrum's stuff)
- Hyper(La)TeX, utilities and creation of pdf (Seb)
+ Generate a question to which fancyheadings is the answer (one almost
  every day on c.t.t)

From Malcolm:
+ how do i manage to set my document ranged left in latex?
  \raggedright seems to work only for a paragraph (just like the manual says).
+ are there interfaces from papyrus or the other bibliographic management
  packages to bibtex?
+ how do i use the new ghostview with the paradissa fonts (i ask this one
  every day, so it is becoming frequent).
+ what is the best way to make an index?
  i.e., how to decide what to index, etc.

From Damian Cugley:
+ What is all the %%% @TeX-file {...} stuff at the top of files?  Is there a
  program for making these headers?  What's this checksum program they refer
  to? (we're now agreed that we're not doing this one, are we?)

From Stephen Gildea:
+ how to get all the semi-standard LaTeX packages (i.e., the set listed in the
  companion -- I haven't checked whether this needs any more work...)
+ how to upgrade to a new release of LaTeX 2e

From Kees van der Laan:
- MetaPost... (Robin)

From Teck Kin Suan <suan@sfu.ca>
+ TeX/LaTeX web sites
+ resume/vita style files
+ some talk about .bst files
+ `coding gems' (hmmm.... how do we address that one?)

From Barbara B
+ MakeTeXPK (and any other font-generation stuff?)
