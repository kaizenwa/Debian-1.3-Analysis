\begin{quotation}\small
  This document is a version of the FAQ article that was published as
  the December 1994 edition of the UKTUG magazine \BV{} (which wasn't
  formatted like this).  The intention is that its content should be
  available to be fed back into the normal \Newsgroup|comp.text.tex|
  FAQ posting some time soon, but that work isn't yet complete.  The
  article is also to be available as a \textsc{www} page.
