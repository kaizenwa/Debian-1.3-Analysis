	(section{Documentation and Help}): use \LaTeX in Lamport's book title

	answers), following discussion with Jonathan;
	add \NeedsTeXFormat requirement (should this be in faq.sty?);
	new section The Background with some stuff moved out from Introduction,

Tue Sep 27 16:10:17 1994  Robin Fairbairns  (rf@dorceus.cl.cam.ac.uk)

Tue Sep 27 14:17:51 1994  Robin Fairbairns  (robin@home)

	* faq.sty: markup commands in separate package (ultimately to come in
	several versions according to the environment it's to be processed in
	-- e.g., versions for PS font usage/cm font usage, even a version for
	processing to plain text?)

	* newfaq.tex: moved all the markup commands out to (new) faq.sty;
	couple of typos corrected following input from Joachim Schrod

Thu Sep 22 09:18:38 1994  Robin Fairbairns  (rf@dorceus.cl.cam.ac.uk)

	* newfaq.tex: (last night's work) new-style markup for question
	references, label for last question (so we can see how well we're
	doing), \makeshortverb of \| so as to get coherent log output
	

Tue Sep 20 13:54:51 1994  Robin Fairbairns  (rf@dorceus.cl.cam.ac.uk)

	* newfaq.tex: moved \documentclass, \usepackage above defs of

	addresses in \Email; put NEWS.ANSWERS into more coherent form
	(verbatim; and yes, it _does_ need to be upper case)
	`pictex manual': escape the $s (!)
	`oztex': it's now shareware, not PD
	`fig and where to get it': remove escape from _ in \path (!)
	`music': corrected email address for Taupin and his ftp site
	`double-spacing': doublespace.sty is a file name; close paren round ref
	to CTAN; "latest release of LaTeX"->"LaTeX2e"
	`macros to do Y': verbatim site index command <term> in text
	`... for machine Y running Q': FTP.nwc is a file, and yes, it is there
	ibid, both AIX and PC made explicit reference to fpt.dante.de
	`blackboard bold': tech-support is an email address; add reference to
	the extraordinary bbm fonts
	`repositories': correct address corresponding to ftp.tex.ac.uk; put
	site index command into verbatim
	`Laserjet': converted S's \Q about Berry's prog into an actual
	reference to it
	`\pagestyle{empty}': correct (;-) spelling of behaviour, "is"->"if"
	`NFSS': rewritten to clarify relationship to New LaTeX
	New question about things like \tenrm in 2e added
	`references wrong': line up corrected code in two columns
	`change margins': indent code
	`width of letter, etc.': indent examples; remove redundant `T' from
	LaTeX
	`LaTeX2e': first production release was June
	`log-like functions': indent examples
	`\@': "?" at end of question
	`Companion ... @': space after LaTeX in question, "!" at end
	`I've found a bug': slight elaboration of 2.09 case
	New version of path.sty with some hacking; redo all S's (and my one)
	markup commands

Mon Sep 19 11:46:40 1994  Robin Fairbairns  (robin@home)

	* define \Newsgroup (same as all the rest, pro tem) and use it for
	comp.tex.tex, comp.unix.wizards, news.answers, comp.sources.unix,
	comp.programming.literate, comp.sources.misc, comp.text, comp.fonts

	* added new questions "what's all this about \@", "but the companion
	tells me to use \@startsection" and "I've found a bug: what do I do"
	(which last was a suggestion of Jonathan's)

	* put \fileversion in the title (rather than \filedate twice)

	* defined command \cs (out of ltxdoc.cls) so that we can put commands
	in question names, required for q32 about \pagestyle{emtpy}
