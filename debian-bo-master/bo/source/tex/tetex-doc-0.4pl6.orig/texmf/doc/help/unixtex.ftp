			GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

... for Unix sites wanting to install (plain) TeX, LaTeX (2e), BibTeX,
Metafont, and DVI processors for any of the X window system,
PostScript, and/or the PCL language in the HP LaserJet.

The files mentioned below are available from any of the following:

    Host			Internet address	TeX root dir
    ----			----------------	------------
    ftp.cdrom.com		165.113.58.253		/pub/tex/ctan
    ftp.tex.ac.uk		134.151.44.19		/tex-archive
    ftp.dante.de		128.69.1.12		/tex-archive
    
    For additional ftp sites, get /README.mirrors from one of the above or
    finger ctan@ftp.tug.org.

    These instructions use non-generic features of FTP supported by the
    hosts above. For details, get:
      /README.archive-features
      /README.site-commands 

The /tex-archive/help and /tex-archive/documentation directories on
these hosts have much additional documentation on all aspects of TeX. If
you don't know (for example) what Metafont is, or the relationship of
LaTeX to TeX, look there.


Complete Unix TeX systems:
--------------------------

I recommend the teTeX distribution for precompiled binaries, or if you
want to retrieve a ready-made system instead of building your own, or in
fact, in general until I release web2c 7.0, since teTeX is actually more
current than the last official web2c (6.1).  It's available from CTAN
hosts in systems/unix/teTeX.  It also contains complete sources, if you
prefer to build your own binaries.

If you get teTeX, you do not need to get web.tar.gz,
web2c.tar.gz, or the other original distributions described below.

If you are looking for a standard Solaris package, contact
mackay@cs.washington.edu.


Retrieving a basic set of input files and fonts:
-----------------------------------------------

ftp> cd /tex-archive/systems/web2c
ftp> bi                              [set binary mode]
ftp> get lib.tar.gz                  [unpacks into texmf; 2.8MB->11.5MB]

     This file contains a minimal collection of fonts (TFM files only,
     and only for Computer Modern, DC, LaTeX, Pandora, and the free
     PostScript fonts), base (La)TeX macros, MF macros, and BibTeX files
     -- enough to get started. The AMS fonts and macros are included.
     The LaTeX release may be out of date; for the latest, and for
     additional LaTeX packages; investigate /tex-archive/macros/latex.

     lib.tar.gz unpacks into a directory named `texmf', which you will
     want in your equivalent of /usr/local/lib -- whatever you will
     define as your $(datadir) in the Makefiles.

     The organization of the archive was debated at great length. We hope
     it will be useful. If you don't like our organization, feel free to
     move the files around as you see fit, not forgetting to redefine the
     search paths and installation directories. The Makefiles,
     kpathsea/HIER, kpathsea/paths.h.in, and web2c/README (``Directory
     hierarchies'') have more information. The organization will
     change to conform to the standard TeX directory structure
     promulgated by the TUG Working Group when the TDS is released.

     You must decide on your directory structure *before* doing the
     compilations, since you must specify default search paths, and
     since by default the web2c Makefile tries to create the basic .fmt
     and .base files, which require the .{tex,mf,tfm} input files.


Retrieving web2c (that is, TeX, Metafont, and friends):
------------------------------------------------------

Still in /tex-archive/systems/web2c:

ftp> get web.tar.gz	[Knuth's WEB sources for TeX, MF, & family:
			 unpacks into ./web2c-<version>; 1.2MB->4MB]
ftp> get web2c.tar.gz	[WEB-to-C source: also unpacks into ./web2c-<version>
                         .75MB->2.7K]

     You must retrieve and unpack *both* web.tar.gz and web2c.tar.gz.
     
     The web2c distribution uses an older version of the path-searching
     library than the drivers below. For an interim patch, get the
     latest ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex/web2c.kpathsea-2.*.help file, and
     read it.  (I'm working on the next release of web2c as hard as I
     can, really.)  The two versions can coexist; by using the web2c
     distribution as it stands, you merely lose the features added to
     kpathsea over the last year or so.


Retrieving device drivers:
-------------------------

       For an X window system previewer (xdvik):
ftp> cd /tex-archive/dviware/xdvik
ftp> get xdvik.tar.gz	[unpacks into ./xdvik-<version>; .5MB->1.8MB]

       For a DVI-to-PostScript translator (dvipsk):
ftp> cd /tex-archive/dviware/dvipsk
ftp> get dvipsk.tar.gz	[unpacks into ./dvipsk-<version>; .7MB->2.7MB]

       For a DVI-to-PCL (HP LaserJet) translator (dviljk):
ftp> cd /tex-archive/dviware/dviljk
ftp> get dviljk.tar.gz	[unpacks into ./dviljk-<version>; .6MB->3MB]

ftp> quit		[end ftp session]


Compilation and installation:
----------------------------

Each of these packages -- web2c, xdvik, dvipsk, dviljk -- contains its
own installation instructions.  It is possible to build all the programs
in a single make (see the web2c.kpathsea-*.help file), but it is simpler
to make them separately.

Compile web2c first (i.e.,, the material in both web.tar.gz and
web2c.tar.gz, unpacked, possibly patched for the most recent kpathsea --
see above, under `retrieving web2c').  For an overview,

	./web2c-<version>/README
	./web2c-<version>/kpathsea/INSTALL
	./web2c-<version>/web2c/README
	./web2c-<version>/web2c/INSTALL

The INSTALL files are your guides to installation.
At the simplest, you do configure && make && make install at the top level.

Remember to set up your texmf directory hierarchy before embarking on 
your compilation (see `For a basic set of input files and fonts' above).

After installation, if basic input files such as plain.tex aren't being
found, or if the file searching is very slow, read kpathsea/INSTALL from
one of the *k driver distributions. (This is much more recent than
kpathsea/INSTALL from web2c.)

All installation processes require careful attention to detail, and
knowledge of your system.  Festina lente -- make haste slowly -- and you
improve your chances of success.

ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex/*.help describe some common problems with the
current version of web2c. Here's some more:

-- Contrary to what the web2c installation instructions imply, you must use
	configure --prefix=/your/tex/root
instead of editing the prefix in the Makefile(s). (Editing does work in
some cases, but not all.)

-- configure does not always guess the type of yytext properly; the
symptom will be compiler errors involving yytext. Replace the line
`DECLARE_YYTEXT' in web2c-6.1/web2c/web2c.h with the right thing. See
web2c.yytext.help.

-- If the compiler complains about something involving foil_x_wchar_t, try
	make CFLAGS="-g -DNO_FOIL_X_WCHAR_T"  (for web2c); or
	make CFLAGS="-g -DFOIL_X_WCHAR_T" (for everything else).

-- I messed up and declared alloca in web2c/web2c/web2c.h. Just delete
the declaration. ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex/web2c.alloca.help does this.

-- make clean removes *.pool in web2c/tex and web2c/mf. Use make
distclean or make mostlyclean instead. Or edit tex/Makefile and
mf/Makefile to remove *.pool at distclean instead of clean.
ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex/web2c.pool.help does this.  (You must apply this
patch before web2c.kpathsea-2.6.help.)


Distribution on tape and CD/ROM:
-------------------------------

For TeX on a single tape (4mm DAT or QIC-24), ordering information is
available from unixtex@u.washington.edu.  A distribution fee 
of US$210.00 is requested to cover administrative costs.

The TeX Live CD-ROM was released in June 1996.  It is a ready-to-run
system based on teTeX.  See http://www.tug.org/tex-live.html for details.

The 4allTeX CD-ROM comes from the NTG, the Dutch-speaking TeX user
group. Email ntg@nic.surfnet.nl, or see http://ei0.ei.ele.tue.nl/ntg/.

The Prime Time TeXcetera CD-ROM is a copy of CTAN; email ptf@ctcl.com or
see http://www.ptf.com/ptf/.

Walnut Creek has a TeX CD. Email info@cdrom.com or see
http://www.cdrom.com:/titles/tex.html.

Other organizations may provide TeX on a CD/ROM, but I do not know the
details to include them here. (Please inform me if you do.)


If you do not have GNU's gunzip utility, you will need to retrieve and
install gzip.

ftp> cd /tex-archive/tools/info-zip
ftp> get gzip-1.2.4.tar

gzip does a better job of compression than standard Unix compress, and
it is (as far as is known) patent-free.  It is illegal to use Unix
compress in the USA, because it infringes a software patent.  Write to
the League for Programming Freedom <lpf@uunet.uu.net> for information
about fighting the new software monopolies.
