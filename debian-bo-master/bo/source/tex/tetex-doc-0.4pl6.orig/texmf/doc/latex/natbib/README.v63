                                NATBIB Package

Version 6.3 (See list of changes below)
            Major change: suppresses extra letters on dates for numerical
                          citations

This is the natbib package for handling both author-year and numerical
BibTeX styles. It contains the following files:
  natbib.dtx  --  Documented source file that may be LaTeXed to get the 
                  detailed description and/or coding documentation; needs
                  ltxdoc class distributed with LaTeX2e.

                  May be docstripped with option `package,all' to get the 
                  natbib.sty package file, or with `package,all,209' to obtain
                  a LaTeX 2.09 style file.  

  natbib.ins  --  A docstrip batch job to extract natbib.sty from the source
                  file natbib.dtx. Simply TeX or LaTeX this file.

                  This file can be extracted from natbib.dtx when it is 
                  LaTeXed and natbib.ins does not already exist.
                  
  plainnat.bst -- Replacements for plain.bst, abbrv.bst, unsrt.bst, the
  abbrvnat.bst    standard BibTeX bib style files. These replacements
  unsrtnat.bst    permit both numerical and author-year citations

Installation:-    Simply run TeX or LaTeX on natbib.ins, which extracts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    natbib.sty from the documented source natbib.dtx. You
                  may first edit natbib.ins if you want natbib209.sty and/or
                  natbib.drv, the configurable documentation driver. If 
                  natbib.ins has been lost, it may be regenerated by running
                  LaTeX on natbib.dtx.
                  
Documentation:-   Run LaTeX on natbib.dtx or natbib.drv. The latter may be
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   edited as needed to conform to local requirements (paper
                  size, duplex or not, with or without entire coding).
                  Alternatively, a ltxdoc.cfg file can contain local
                  configurations.

The package will accept BibTeX output in the forms:
   \bibitem{key}              (standard numerical format)

or the following author-year formats:
   \bibitem[Jones et al.(1990)]{key}...      (native natbib style)
   \bibitem[Jones et al.(1990)Jones, Baker, and Williams]{key}... 
                                             (extended natbib 5.3 style)

   \bibitem[Jones et al., 1990]{key}...      (apalike style)
   \bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Jones, Baker, and Williams}{Jones
       et al.}{1990}]{key}...                (newapa or chicago styles)
   \bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Jones et al.}{1990}]{key}... (named style)
   \bibitem[\protect\astroncite{Jones et al.}{1990}]{key}...   (astron style)
   \bibitem[\protect\citename{Jones et al., }1990]{key}...  (authordate style)
   \harvarditem[Jones et al.]{Jones, Baker, and Williams}{1990}{key}...
                                                            (harvard style)

These are all the existing interfaces for author-year format that I could
find. Natbib.sty accepts them all, and converts them into its own system.

Usage with \cite command:
  \cite{key}  ==>>  Jones et al. (1990)           (in-text form)
  \cite[]{key} ==>> (Jones et al., 1990)          (parenthetical form)
  \cite[]{key1,key2} ==>> (Jones et al., 1990, 1992)
          (multiple citations; common authors suppressed)
  \cite[chap. 2]{key} ==>> (Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2)
  \cite[see][]{key} ==>> (see Jones et al., 1990)
  \cite[see][chap. 2]{key} ==>> (see Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2)

All \cite's may also take a starred version to print the full
author list, if that is supported by the bib style file.
  \cite*[]{key} ==>> (Jones, Baker, and Williams, 1990)

Other citing commands 
  \citeauthor{key} ==>> Jones et al.
  \citeyear{key} ==>> 1990
  \citefullauthor{key} ==>> Jones, Baker, and Williams

To simplify switching between numerical and author-year mode, use 
\citet{key} for textual citations.
  \citet{key} ==>> Jones et al. (1990)   (author-year)
              ==>> Jones et al. [21]     (numerical)
(\cite{key} yields [21] only in numerical mode)

Punctuation may be altered with \bibpunct command (see comments and 
  examples in natbib.sty and natbib.dtx)
  
Or may be specified with options to the \usepackage{natbib} command.

Punctuation styles may be set for given .bst file and then invoked by the
\bibliographystyle command. This requires making a simple (and legitimate)
addition to natbib.sty, or creating a local configuration file natbib.cfg to
contain the additions.

For full details, print out the documentation in natbib.dtx by LaTeXing
it (this requires the ltxdoc.cls and doc.sty of 1994/05/08 or later).

List of changes

Changes from previous (4.x) versions: 
  \cite now takes two optional arguments for text before and after citation
  \citeyear and \citeauthor have been added
  Under LaTeX2e, punctuation can be selected with options in \usepackage

  V5.1: pure LaTeX2e, not mixed as v5.0 was. Fixes up problems of font
        commands in the citation labels (like {\em et al.} that caused
        terrible problems and had a poor ad hoc solution.

  V5.2: \citeauthor and \citeyear make auxiliary file entries so BibTeX
        can see them; also, any font changes in the author (like {\it Smith})
        will be localized (in 5.0, the brackets were removed, so all following
        text was italicized.)

        Internal definition of \cite made to be like that of LaTeX2e, so that
        multiple citations may have spaces after commas, as \cite{a, b, c}

        A local configuration file natbib.cfg will be read in (2e only) that
        may contain local \bibstyle@xxx commands.

  V5.3: support the new release of harvard.sty, so that natbib will work with
        those bib styles that are designed for it (agms,dcu,kluwer) This means
        adding \harvardand, \harvardurl, and some others

        provide \citefullauthor to list all authors for those bib styles that
        support this: harvard, chicago

        extend the native format of \bibitem to support full author citations
        too; add starred form of \cite to print full author list, if present.

        fix up a bug that caused accents in citations (not references) to be
        ignored.

  V5.4: a few bugs fixed
  
        add superscript citation style to \bibpunct, as `s' (in place of
        `n' for numerical or `a' for author-year; improve superscript coding
        
        add \citestyle command to be able to invoke a preprogrammed citation
        style that is different from that given in \bibliographystyle
        
        for (Jones et al, 1994a; Jones et al, 1994b) print instead
            (Jones et al, 1994a,b)   
        [up until now, it would have printed (Jones et al, 1994a, 1994b) ]

  V5.5: some fixed bugs
  
        Many internal names have been changed to recommended style, ie with
        the prefix \NAT@...  For example, \@citebegin and \@citeend are
        now \NAT@open and \NAT@close (these contain the opening and closing
        brackets).
        
        Where possible, \def has been replaced by \(re)newcommand.
        
        Selection of citation format (numerical, superscript, author-year) is
        coded better; previously, if numerical were ever selected, it was
        impossible to switch back to author-year.
        
**      As a result: ALL CITATION CUSTOMIZATIONS (\bibpunct, \citestyle) MUST
**      BE ISSUED BEFORE \begin{document}!!!!!  This differs from the
**      situation in earlier versions, but is in fact much more logical.

        Add \citep{key} and \citep*{key} as shorthands for 
          \cite[]{key} and \cite*[]{key}, ie for parenthetical citations
          (this was requested)
          
        Add \citealt{key} and \citealt*{key} that function like \cite{key} and
          \cite*{key}, but without brackets. These are textual citations of
          the form Jones et al. 1990. (Also a requested feature.)
        
        The amount of hanging indentation in the list of references can be
          redefined via the length command \bibhang. Change with e.g.
          \setlength{\bibhang}{2em}  %Default is 1em

  V6.0  New method for parsing the author and year parts, which is now done
        before writing the information to the auxiliary file. This allows
        numerical citations to be used even with author-year bst files.
        (Numerical bst files can NEVER generate author-year citations!)
        Now provide replacements for standard BibTeX bst files so that
        they may be used for both numerical and author-year.
        
        Note: the bib style file provided in previous releases (natbib.bst)
        is no longer provided, since it only meant to be an example. It is now
        replaced by plainnat.bst and others.

        Citation styles (punctuation, brackets, etc) can be selected in
        various ways: an improved priority system has now been introduced.
        For example, any punctuation selection through an option to
        \usepackage has priority over any prestored citation style.

        \bibpunct can now take a 7th optional argument (at the start of
        the list) for the punctuation that comes before a post-note.

        It is possible to have all citations and entries in the list of 
        references automatically entered in an index, either with the standard
        makeidx package or the contributed index package of David M. Jones.

  v6.1  The LaTeX update of December 1995 contains some changes to internal
        command which natbib has used. Natbib needs to be altered accordingly.
        In fact, it has been made far more robust against any such future
        interal changes, although not 100%. 

        There are no changes to the user interface.

  v6.2  Adds \citet for textual citations in both author-year and numerical
        modes.

        Adds \bibsep as a length that goes between lines of the reference list
        Can be changed with \setlength

        Fixes the superscript style of numerical references so that the 
        numbers are the proper (smaller) size

        Fixes a clash with the classes amsart and amsbook

  v6.3  The package `showkeys' used to have some problems when loaded 
        before natbib; this is now repaired

        The supplied .bst files have a bug fixed so that the extra letters
        added to the dates function properly; they are now added when the
        abbreviated author list and date are the same for more than one
        reference (previously the full author list and date determined this,
        which is incorrect)

        With numerical citations, the extra letters are superfluous; these can
        now be suppressed with the supplied .bst files
