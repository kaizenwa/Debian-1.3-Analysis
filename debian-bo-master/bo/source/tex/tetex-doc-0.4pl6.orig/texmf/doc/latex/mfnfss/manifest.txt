% CONTENTS OF THE MFNFSS BUNDLE
% =============================

dccr.mf
        Metafont source file used by the output files from dccrstd.tex
        to generate Concrete Roman fonts in T1 encoding.  It needs the
        DC-Font sources which are *not* part of this bundle but can be
        found on CTAN servers and other archives.

dccrstd.tex
        TeX file used in the generation of Concrete Roman fonts in T1
        encoding.  It will produce a number of .mf files corresponding
        to Concrete Roman fonts in different sizes.  By modifying the
        table inside this file further Metafont driver files can be
        generated.  The .fd files for the Concrete Roman fonts can be
        produced with cmextra.ins which is part of the LaTeX2e base
        system.

oldgerm.dtx
        Package to typeset with old german fonts designed by Yannis
        Haralambous.  These fonts use special ligatures to access
        accented characters and may therefore need additional
        definitions if used with packages like babel or
        german.  Support for this might be added in future
        releases.  Please don't report those kind of problems as bugs,
        we do know about it.

oldgerm.ins
        Installation script for the oldgerm package.

pandora.dtx
        Package to typeset with pandora fonts.

pandora.ins
