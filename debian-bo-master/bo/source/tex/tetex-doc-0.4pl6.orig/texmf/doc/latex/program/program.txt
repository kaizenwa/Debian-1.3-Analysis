Here's a copy of my LaTeX2e style file for typesetting programs and
algorithms in my favourite style without having to type in endless tabbing
commands. Each line is set in math mode so all the indentation and spacing
is done automatically. The notation |variable_name| can be used within
normal text, maths expressions or programs to indicate a variable name.
Use \origbar to get a normal | symbol in a program. The commands \A, \B, \R, \T
and \Z typeset the corresponding bold letter with the next object as a
substript (eg \S1 typesets {\bf S$_1$} etc). They now cope with primes as
well, (eg \S'''). The program.sty file can be
easily edited to reflect your favoured style. See the program-demo.tex file 
for examples.

The file should work with or without AMSLaTeX and the new font selection
scheme.
