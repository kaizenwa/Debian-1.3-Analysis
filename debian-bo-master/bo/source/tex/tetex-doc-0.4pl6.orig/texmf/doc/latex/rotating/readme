A package built on the standard \LaTeX\ graphics package, and performs
all the different sorts of rotation one might like, including complete
figures and captions. The commented source contains the manual, and
there is a set of tests in examples.tex. 

Install by running \TeX\ on rotating.ins and place `rotating.sty'
where \LaTeX\ can find it.
