           How to report errors and bugs with the dc fonts

To improve the quality of the dc fonts and to make them free of any errors 
and bugs, your feedback is appreciated. 

Please make sure, that your report is concise, clear and reproduceable, also 
make sure, that you are using the newest version of the dc fonts and that
your bug isn't fixed yet.

The following information is needed:

Which font produced the bug?

Which mode do you use?

What is the error message issued by METAFONT?

Which character carries the error? Is the error visible in the output and
how can it be described? Always try to generate output and look at it 
first, some errors may be invisible at all.

Please include the .log file in your report.

The fonts should work at resolutions from 200dpi upwards, and in a size 
range from 5pt to 100pt. If your effective resolution lies below 200dpi
(screen modes or fonts at reduced sizes), if the parameter blacker of your 
mode is negative, or if you generate a font outside the given size range,
problems are to be expected and do not qualify as bugs.

The funny fonts needn't work at all, they surely don't work at low sizes.
The typewriter fonts don't work below 8pt.

If you have a fix for your your problem, it is very appreaciated.

Please report errors to
