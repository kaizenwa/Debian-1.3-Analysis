Welcome to the Babel system!

This file contains the distribution guide for version 3.6 of the
Babel system.

The Babel system supports multilingual typesetting.
This version of the Babel system is compatible with LaTeX2e.

This system is maintained by Johannes Braams in cooperation with
various people around Europe.

The Babel system is described in:

This distribution is described in the files ending with .txt.  You
should read install.txt before starting to install Babel.

If you like the babel system, please send me a postcard with a nice
postage stamp for my collection!

Please do not request updates from me.  Distribution is done only
through mail servers and TeX organisations.


Please send bug reports to the LaTeX bug reporting address, 
latex-bugs@uni-mainz.de. Please read the file bugs.txt in this
distribution and follow the guidelines.

WARNINGS:
---------
- The file wnhyphen.tex (russian hyphenation pattern file) contains
  changes of uppercase and lowercase codes. Amongst these is
  \uccode`\~=`\^ which may lead to unexpected results when the ~
  occurs in the argument of \uppercase
- The file francais.dtx (francais.ldf) has been replaced by
  frenchb.dtx (frenchb.ldf). When upgrading from an older version of
  babel you need to remove francais.ldf.
