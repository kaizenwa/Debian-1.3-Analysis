Things that still need to be done (1997/01/14) :
================================================

- Integrate the work of Jun Takashima (<tjun@aa.tufs.ac.jp>) to
  integrate his work on Sanskrit and Kannada into the babel
  distribution. 

- The introduction of \peek@token in the expansion of shorthands
  made them inexpandable, which breaks things like \char"012,
  \char'177 when " or ' are active.

- The russian hyphenation file contains \uccode `\~=`\^...
  This needs perhaps to be made a local change which is re-installed
  when russian becomes the active language; needs investigation

- Fully incorporate the work of Olga Lapko, in particular the support
  for the 8-bit version of the fonts and the support for having
  cyrillic instead of latin fonts preloaded in the LaTeX format.

- Add slovakian quotatian characters,
  as suggested by Jana Chlebikova:
  we have another quotation characters as in English. The opening
  quotation character is similar to Polish opening quotation (see
  Proceedings from EUROTEX'92, pages 125) and closing quotation
  characters is similar as German cl. quat. For ilustration I send you
  macros (from another slovak.sty) with this things. In that sty you
  can use both (english and slovak quotations marks) depending on the
  value \csprimeon or \csprimeoff.  I think, it is a good idea and
  macro looks quite nice. According me something similar is neccesery
  to do in babel-slovak.sty.

- Implement the suggestions for italian.sty from Claudio Beccari
