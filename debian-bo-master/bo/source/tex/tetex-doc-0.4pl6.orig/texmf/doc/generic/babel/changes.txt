Thu Jan 23 22:53:49 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Added a couple of
	\expandafters to the end of hyphen.cfg as \toks8 is now cleared by
	LaTeX (release 1996/12/01), now copy contents of \toks into
	\everyjob instead of reference.
	(found by Richard Walker <Richard.Walker@cs.anu.edu.au> PR 2382
	Ulrik Vieth <vieth@thphy.uni-duesseldorf.de> PR 2385 and
	Vincent Jalby <jalby@unilim.fr>)

	* babel.ins: Added missing \usepreamble\mainpreamble line; changed
	1996 in 1997.

	* finnish.dtx: Forgot to remove the code that is now part of
	\LdfInit; hence babel.def was loaded twice which led to TeX fatal
	errors.
	(found by Niilo Siljamo <Niilo.Siljamo@Helsinki.FI> PR 2386)

Sun Jan 19 22:00:49 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx : Got the order of cs's wrong in the definition of
	\@tempcntb (found by Ricardo S. C\'armenes
	<carmenes@biosun.quimica.uniovi.es> PR 2376) 

Fri Jan 17 20:06:30 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx: Somehow a lonely '+' had found its way into babel.dtx
	on a line of its own. Removed
	(found by Maarten Gelderman <mgelderman@ECON.VU.NL>)

Tue Jan 14 00:40:01 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* dutch.dtx : Added the "~ shorthand (copied from germanb.dtx) as
	suggested on TEX-NL@nic.surfnet.nl

	* bbplain.dtx : missing \@undefined added to definition of
	\@begindocumenthook; \newcount is an \outer macro, so it can't be
	used directly inside an \if test.
	(found by Daniel Flippo)
	 

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Added
	\bbl@redefine@long to be able to redefine \ifthenelse as a
	\long-command (PR2372)
	Changed redefinition of \ifthenelse to make it a \long-command
	(PR2372) 

Thu Jan  9 00:15:16 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* frenchb.dtx : allow \l@french and \l@francais to be the `name'

	Use frenchb.cfg as the name of the .cfg file, regardless of the
	option that was used.
	(subsection{Formatting numbers}): New macros \nombre \decimalsep
	and \thousandsep added to format numbers
	(subsection{Extra utilities}): Removed \AllTeX, \fup, \french and

	(found by J"org Knappen <tex@dzdmza.zdv.uni-mainz.de>, PR 2357)

Wed Jan  8 23:31:00 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* spanish.dtx,galician.dtx : Added \leavevmode to the definitinos

	vertical mode.
	(found by Eric Gamess <eric@borabora.univalle.edu.co>, PR 2363)

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): Added the options
	frenchb, UKenglish and USenglish (all aliases)

Wed Jan  8 00:03:37 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* galician.dtx : Removed unwanted space tokens by adding a
	%-token at the end of the lines with babel@save in the definition
	of \extrasgalician. They turned up in the output. (just like for
	spanish.dtx) 

	* catalan.dtx : Removed unwanted space tokens by adding a
	%-token at the end of the lines with babel@save in the definition
	of \extrascatalan. They turned up in the output. (just like for
	spanish.dtx) 

Tue Jan  7 16:34:20 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* greek.fdd (section{The font definition files}): In some font
	substitutions kdgr hadn't been replaced with cmr.
	(found by J"org Knappen, PR2358)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Introduced
	\foreign@language for the shared code between the otherlanguage*
	environment and the \foreignlanguage command.
	Switch off language shorthands before activating the extras (to
	prevent that the shorthands from one language are still available
	in the other.
	Add \relax after the setting of the hyphenmin parameters to
	prevent the disappearance of a token (when it happens to be a
	digit, such as \number\day).
	(found by Daniel Hempel <daniel@math.uni-hamburg.de> PR2362)

	* spanish.dtx : Removed two unwanted space tokens by adding a
	%-token at the end of the lines with babel@save in the definition
	of \extrasspanish. They turned up in the output.
	(found by Daniel Hempel <daniel@math.uni-hamburg.de> PR2362)

	* bbplain.dtx (section{Support for formats based on
	\textsc{plain}\TeX}): add definition of \@begindocumenthook to the
	LaTeX2.09 format; otherwise it won't function without one of the
	languages loaded.

	<vieth@thphy.uni-duesseldorf.de> (PR 2356)

Sun Jan  5 20:48:37 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): When \LdfInit is
	undefined we need to load babel.def from babel.sty.
        When \file{hyphen.cfg} is not loaded in the format \cs{l@english}
        might not be defined; assume english is language 0 before calling
        \main@language{english}.
	(found by J"org Knappen <tex@mzdmza.zdv.uni-mainz.de> PR2354)

Thu Jan  2 23:18:58 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx : The redefinition of \dump tried to detect
	LaTeX2.09; it did that with \document; that cs is also defined by
	AMSTeX, hence an error occured building a Babel-AMSTeX format.
	Now use \@ztryfc to detect LaTeX2.09 (Hope that is obscure
	enough). (Found by Thomas Esser)

Mon Dec 30 15:04:21 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Support for extending macros}): Added a
	check for an expansion of \relax to the definition of \addto;
	\addto\x{...} yields \x -> {\x ...} when \x expands to \relax.
	This results in a stack overflow when \x is called.

Sun Dec 29 14:24:42 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* italian.dtx, russian.dtx : Added braces around second argument
	of \LdfInit
	(found by <tim@maths.tcd.ie> (Timothy Murphy), PR 2384)  

Tue Dec 24 22:00:00 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	Release 3.6

Sat Dec 14 19:54:46 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): Added the option
	`welsh'.

Thu Nov  7 22:59:23 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): \selectlanguage now
	checks for the existence of \date<lang> instead of \l@<lang>. The
	latter might be defined, without the language definition file
	being loaded. 

Tue Oct 29 00:42:11 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Renamed \init@ldf
	and \finish@ldf to \LdfInit, \ldf@finish and introduce
	\quit@ldf. The second argument of \ldf@init can now be either a
	control sequence or a string to be passed to \csname.
	(subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Added (conditional)
	redefinition of \@@vpageref (varioref internal macro) to prevent
	problems with active characters (PR 2292)

Thu Oct 17 00:03:30 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	.ldf-files.

Wed Oct 16 20:34:59 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): \main@language now
	also sets \languagename and \l@<languagename> for use by other
	packages in the preamble of a document 
	(suggested by Jan Vroonhof <vroonhof@math.ethz.ch>)

Tue Oct  8 00:01:26 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx : Make this file be processed twice, once during
	format generation, but only a small portion of the file is loaded
	into the format, the second time the file is processed is when it
	is loaded from babel.def. This way some code that is not needed in
	the format gets removed and the plain format with babel is no
	longer incompatible with german.sty.

Fri Oct  4 12:29:37 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* dutch.dtx: Merged in the definitions for `afrikaans' as supplied
	by Stoffel Lombard <lombc@b31pc87.up.ac.za>

	* bbcompat.dtx: Added support for `afrikaans'

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): Added option `afrikaans'

Sat Sep 21 19:40:07 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* slovene.dtx : removed shorthand for \texttt{"L} as it is not
	needed for slovenian according to Primoz Peterlin
	<peterlin@biofiz.mf.uni-lj.si>.

Fri Sep 20 19:58:26 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* catalan.dtx : Added a check for mathmode to the definitino of
	\lgem and \Lgem, as the use of these in mathmode makes no sense
	according to Goncal Badenes. Not having the check led to an error
	message (PR 2261)

Sun Aug 18 00:25:04 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* polish.dtx : The macros \sob, \spb and \skb need to call
	\leavevmode; when they are encountered in vertical mode TeX issues
	an error about \lower not being allowed in vertical mode. (found
	by Wlodzimierz Macewicz <macewicz@ia.pw.edu.pl>)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): In order to
	prevent problems while reading .fd files in the middle of a
	document we need to add the " and ' characters to \nfss@catcodes
	untill LaTeX does that herself. (found by Tomas	Bautista
	<bautista@cma.ulpgc.es>) 

Thu Aug 15 00:34:21 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx : Added default (semi-NFSS2) definition of \ss and
	\i because german.sty in combination with a babel format creates
	an endless lopp on those glyphs. (Found by Bernd Raichle)

	* danish.dtx : According to Peter Busk Laursen the shorthand "'
	needs to typeset the german closing double quote (``). He also
	suggested to add the definitions for "~ and "=

Tue Aug 13 23:58:29 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Top level expansion of
	\normal@char<char> where the shorthand character is already active
	should be the expansion of the active character, not the active
	character itself as this causes an endless loop (found by Tomas
	Bautista <bautista@cma.ulpgc.es>)

Sun Aug 11 23:19:42 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Redefinition
	of \ifthenelse added to circumvent problems with \pageref in the
	argument of \isodd (PR's 947, 2053, 2150, 2225)

Fri Aug  9 00:17:06 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bahasa.dtx: Added the setting of the hyphenmin parameters

	for language definition files that are loaded by more than one
	option

Fri Jul 12 21:11:57 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	.ldf file out of babel.sty into .ldf file.
	Rearranged .dtx file to remove long lines of documentation and
	code. 

Thu Jul 11 23:55:26 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): Moved all code necessary
	to support multiple options to load the same language definition
	file into those language definition files. (PR2213)

	* portuges.dtx, norsk.dtx, magyar.dtx: moved support for multiple
	options using the same .ldf file out of babel.sty into .ldf
	files. 

Wed Jul 10 22:08:11 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx : Added the definition of \scriptsize,
	\textquoteright and \textquotedblright (PR 2216)

	* language definition files : Consistently use \@undefined instead
	of \undefined and \@empty instead of \empty (PR 2213)

	* english.dtx, german.dtx : moved support for multiple options

Tue Jul  9 19:50:55 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	and remove the use of \patterns@loaded (PR 2213)
	Added definition of \@empty; use it instead of \empty

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Removed the use of
	the control sequence \bbl@eq@ (PR 2213)

	Use \@empty instead of \empty to be consistent with \LaTeX
	(PR 2133) 

	* bahasa.dtx : Added translation of `Proof' as suggested by
	knappen@vkpmzd.kph.uni-mainz.de (J"org Knappen) (PR 2214)

	** released Babel 3.6-beta **
 	
Sat Jul  6 20:21:45 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

Thu May 30 00:13:36 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* germanb.dtx : added \allowhyphens in the definitions of "a, "o,
	"u, "A, "O, "U, because the underlying macro \lower@umlaut can not
	cntain a \allowhyphens. The reason is that for *dutch* we need to
	use discretionaries for these same characters in order to make the
	trema disappear at a word break. A \allowhyphens inside one of the
	arguments of \discretiionary leads to a TeX error.

Wed May 29 23:55:10 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Added an environment
	otherlanguage* wich does not switch the captions and date strings,

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}):
	\bbl@redefinerobust made non-robust macros; fixed adding \space in
	the final line of code.

Tue Apr  2 23:49:16 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Umlauts and trema's}): Added a
	\allowhyphens in the definition of \lower@umlaut

Mon Apr  1 23:47:31 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

Wed Mar  6 00:00:05 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Added a system level
	shorthand for the ` to prevent an endless loop when the user
	enters `{}blah in his document.

	* catalan.dtx : Added `` as a shorthand for the double left quote;
	getting a single quote and an accented letter from the input ``a
	is not quit what would be expected.

Mon Feb 12 19:43:18 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* czech.dtx (section{The Czech language}): Fixed tow errors found
	by Petr Sojka <sojka@daeron.fi.muni.cz> (PR #2082) and added
	translation for `Proof'

Thu Jan 25 23:11:53 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Store and restore the lccode
	of the ~-character so it remains unchanged by
	\initiate@active@char

Wed Jan 24 23:02:06 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Macros common to a number of languages}):
	Moved \german@dq@disc, \usorbian@dq@disc and \swedish@dq@disc to
	babel.def, changing the name to \bbl@disc

Sun Jan 21 23:28:57 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Revert the
	previous change; \@setref gets expanded too late which results in
	TeX errors because the active character isn't redefined when TeX
	tries to use it in constructing a csname.

Fri Jan 19 23:42:50 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Redefine
	\@setref instead of \ref and \pageref for LaTeX2e. This (partly)
	solves PR0947 which complains about pageref being used in the
	argument of \ifthenelse. This now works as long as the label
	doesn't contain active characters.

Thu Jan 18 23:12:00 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* croatian.dtx : Added translation of the word `Proof' and changed
	the definition of \datecroatian according to the suggestion by
	Sime Ungar <ungar@math.hr> in bug report 2060.

Tue Jan 16 23:56:38 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Use
	\strip@prefix only on bbl@tempa (in \@testdef) when \bbl@tempa <>
	\relax! 

Mon Jan 15 23:44:52 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx: Added the code that implements \newcommand (or
	enough of it to make \ProvideTextCommandDefault and friends
	work).

Wed Jan 10 00:04:57 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): Now use frenchb.dtx from
	Daniel Flipo as the source for french support in Babel.

Tue Jan  9 00:34:59 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Deal with charcters that are
	already active: define the top level expansion inside the \if
	branch of the category code test; define all lower level expansion
	macros needed for the shorthand stuff after of the \else branch
	(subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Complete rewrite of
	\@testdef using meaning to prevent endless complaints from LaTeX
	about possibly changed labels.

Fri Dec  1 13:02:52 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Reset the category code of a

	Portuguese and Brazilian

Thu Nov 16 00:19:49 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Changed the
	definition of \selectlanguage and \selectlanguage_; the former no
	longer processes its argument, that task is now performed by
	\selectlanguage_

Wed Nov 15 00:24:48 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Added the
	commands \bbl@redefine and \bbl@redefinerobust and used them to
	redefine \newlabel, \@testdef, \ref, \pageref, \label, \@citex,
	\nocite, \bibcite, \@bibitem, \@lbibitem

Sat Nov 11 00:30:12 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	improve hyphenation 

Sat Nov 11 00:25:09 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	effect. 

Fri Nov 10 23:42:47 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* catalan.dtx : Added setting of the lowercase code of the ' to
	improve hyphenation
	(As suggested by Claudio Beccari <BECCARI@polito.it>)

	* italian.dtx : Added setting of the lowercase code of the ' to
	improve hyphenation 
	(As suggested by Claudio Beccari <BECCARI@polito.it>)

	* romanian.dtx :  Added translation of the word `Proof'

Wed Nov  8 00:50:45 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx: Added the code that `snatched' \dump as it is still
	needed for LaTeX 2.09

	* germanb.dtx : Added \allowhyphens to the accent producing
	shorthands. Not having it prevented hyphenation for accented words
	in OT1 encoding. Having it means that TeX possibly misses a
	possible breakpoint. Putting \allowhyphens into the definition of
	\lower@umlaut (which would make it not appear at all in T1
	encoding) is a no-no because it leads to improper discretionary
	errors for dutch (were trema's have to disappear when the word is
	hyphenated next to the trema). (PRs 1118, 1147, 1714, 1846)
