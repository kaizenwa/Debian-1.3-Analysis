##*****************************************************************************

- Not yet
	Inheritance via crossref can be used to access fields in another
	record. E.g. this means that crossreferencing inproceedings can access
	the booktitle of the proceedings.

	Internally BibTool can handle more than one database simultaneously.
	Let's see how this can be used.

	print.all.strings acts like described in the documentation.

- Version 2.34
	Default value of key.expand.macros changed to on. This seems to be a
	more sensible default value. (Possible incomatibility to old version)

	new.format.type introduced. This command can be used to specify
	formatting rules for names. It is used in conjunction with the %p
	format specification which has been added.

	The format specifiers for counting names/words/characters have been
	added. Those act as booleans which force backtracking if they fail.
	The qualifier # is used to enable counting.

	When writing macro files undefined macros are written as
	_string instead of @STRING. Thus they are comments to BibTeX.

	The command line options -x and -X now also set print.all.strings to
	off. (This has no effect yet)

	The documentation has been updated.

- Version 2.33
	Reference card added (prepared for A4 paper).
	Bug-fix in rewrite.c. add.field no longer crashes.
	Format specifiers %n and %N now also use the post argument. This
	argument is used to restrict the number of characters transferred.

- Version 2.32
	New resource select.fields introduced. This resource controlls
	which fields are considered when selecting with -X.

- Version 2.31
	I have moved to a new job. My email address has been changed in all
	files (maybe I have missed some?).

	The resource select.case.sensitive behaved contra-intuitive.
	This has been fixed. This means that old scripts might need adaption.

	select and rewrite.rule can take several fields now. Thus you can 
	specify several selections or rewrites more compact.

	The survey of related programs in the documentation has been enlarged.

- Version 2.30
	Minor bugfix in s_parse.c. Resource specifications in the
	command line may have let to an overflow of an array. This has
	been fixed.

	New resource print.parentheses introduced. This resource
	allows the user to specify whether {} or () should be used to
	delimit each record.

- Version 2.29
	Support for compilation without the GNU Regular Expression Library
	improved.

	The @comment is really more liberal than I thought. This prefix is
	simply ignored (As I have read in the BibTeX sources). This behaviour
	is now also performed by BibTool.

- Version 2.28
	Some additional updates for the new makefiles.
	Bugfix in print.c which let to additional strings after the regular
	end of an entry.

- Version 2.27
	Reorganization of the files. Slight corrections of function protptypes
	in various files. Change of the Makefile to support Amiga SAS/C.

- Version 2.26
	Minor bug in key.c fixed. One step further to a 8-bit clean program.
	I wonder which 8-bit traps are still hidden in BibTool.

	The TeX macro mechnism has been enhanced to allow one to define single
	character macros. This means tex.define automatically makes a character
	active if it is encountered as macro name of a definition.

- Version 2.25
	Finally all separators can be arbitrary strings. Only allowed
	characters are used (as it has been done in version 1.*). I hope this
	finally fixes the bug in key.c which I had troubles with in the 
	previous versions.

- Version 2.24
	Documentation for regular expressions added.
	Resource select and select.case.sensitive added. The selection allows
	to specify a regular expression for arbitrary fields. This subsumes the
	old extract.regex which is kept for backward compatibility.
	A bugfix in 2.23 corrected.

- Version 2.23
	Some minor modifications for DEC-Alpha.
	Some minor modifications for the native HP C compiler.
	Some bugs in key.c fixed.

- Version 2.22
	\par (double newlines) is preserved now. parse.c has been modified.
	The line breaking algorithm in print.c has been adapted.

	Allocation bug in stack.c fixed.
	Bug in expand.c which added garbage to expanded strings.
	Some improvements for non-ANSI C compilers (I really don't know why I
	continue this).

- Version 2.21

	Preserving of case of keys introduced. For this purpose the resource
	preserve.key.case has been introduced. The management of the list of
	old keys is done in macros.c mainly. Minor change in print.c and
	parse.c.

- Version 2.20

	Minor bug fix in sort.order.
	Compression method changed to gzip.

- Version 2.19

	Key format specifiers t, w, W introduced. w, W, t and T take a post
	argument to limit the number of characters to use.
	sort.order introduced to sort fields in an entry.
	Wrong mail addresses in many files corrected.

- Version 2.18

	Rewriting missed some multiply occurring patterns. (rewrite.c)
	Resource rewrite.limit added.
	Problem with recursive resources fixed. (parse.c)

- Version 2.17

	The documentation is now compatible with LaTeX 2e.

- Version 2.16

	New resource print.newline introduced to control the number of 
	empty lines between records.
	MSDOS support: Imitating emtex search path initialization as option.

- Version 2.15

	Some problems with 8-bit characters fixed.
	String expansion before key generation added: key.expand.macro
	Hashindex was computed wrong for some strings with ASCII values > 127.
	Hashtable enlarged and new algorithm for hashindex

- Version 2.14

	delete.field bug fixed. The deletion of the last field lead
	to the deletion of all fields. (rewrite.c)
	Comments added to print.c
	Target zip in Makefile.

- Version 2.13

	Yet more modifications for the MSDOS port.
	What a brain-dead OS.

- Version 2.12

	Version 2.12 of GNU regex library integrated.
	alloca.c is no longer needed.
	Some improvements for the MSDOS port.
	aux.[ch] renamed to tex_aux.[ch]
	Resource search path seems to work now.

- Version 2.11

	Some typos fixed.
	Redefinition of entry types enabled.

- Version 2.10

	String/Macro expansion added: expand.macros
	Case in-sensitive treatment of ignored words.
	Some additional targets in Makefile.

- Version 2.09

	Makefile enhanced.
	Error/verbose/debug messages improved.
	Hell, I forgot to remove trace statements.

- Version 2.08

	Comment parsing and printing improved.
	symbol.type introduced.
	Minor improvement of non-ANSI support.

	Preference bug for search path building fixed.
	Rewriting enhanced.

- Version 2.04

	String parser introduced. Error checking/messages improved.
	Undocumented command line options changed.
	Command line specification of resources introduced.
	Minor bug fixes.
	Code slightly reorganized. (I really found a static array)
	Samples directory renamed to Lib.

	Resource optimize is obsolete. The functionality can be achieved
	by field rewriting.
	Resource search path introduced.
