First of all: you *must* run dvicopy (or otherwise expand the vf
definitions) before running dvilj to use these fonts. dvilj does not
read vf's.

The fonts here are of two sorts.

1) TFM's corresponding exactly to the fonts in the various HP encodings
that are built into the Laser Jet 4 (in the subdirectory base). These
were built by Norm Walsh.  This distribution contains only those HP
fonts which are actually referenced by the virtual fonts (to keep the
size of the distribution down).  You can get the remainder of the fonts,
along with the programs Norm wrote to create them, from
ibis.cs.umass.edu:pub/norm/lj.

These TFM's have extra information in them used by dvilj to construct
the PCL commands necessary to access them. See dviljk/tfm.c for the
technical details.

I wasn't willing (or able) to add all the HP encodings to the fontname
document (ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex/fontname), hence these names do not
follow that document. Norm's names are given in the second column of
src/hp.map. For example, unr8u is Univers regular in the 8u encoding.


2) TFM's and VF's that I built using Alan Jeffrey's fontinst macros
(<ctan host>:tex-archive/fonts/utilities/fontinst). These do follow the
fontname document, and are available in both a plain-compatible and
Cork-compatible encodings. For example, cunm is CG's Univers medium in the
plain-compatible encoding, and cunmq is the same in Cork style.

The Cork encoding is described in TUGboat 11(4).


The support files I wrote to create the fonts are in src.fonts.  The
file src.fonts/oneline.tex prints out a one-line showing of all the fonts.

hwir (B&H Wingdings) and msyr (Monotype Symbol) have no VF's; these are
symbol fonts, and no reencoding is necessary or desirable.


I only worked with the builtin fonts for the LaserJet 4. Norm did build
the same style TFM's for the LJ3 builtin fonts, but I don't have a LJ3,
so I punted. (Also, I had no good idea about what to name them.)
