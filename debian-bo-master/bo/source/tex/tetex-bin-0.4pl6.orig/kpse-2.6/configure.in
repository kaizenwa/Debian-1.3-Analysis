dnl Top-level configure for kpathsea-using programs.
dnl Our job is to run configure in the relevant subdirectories.
dnl
dnl Assumption: each program will create a c-auto.h that defines
dnl everything kpathsea needs.  We arrange this by including (at
dnl autoconf time) kpathsea/common.ac.
dnl 
dnl Consequence: we don't need to run configure in the kpathsea directory
dnl itself; we can just copy from a program directory.  We'll use the
dnl first one.

AC_INIT(kpathsea/kpathsea.texi)

AC_PROG_MAKE_SET

dnl Because we include make/common.make.
AC_PROG_CC

dnl If we guessed the prefix in the subdirectories, it might guess
dnl differently than the prefix here, and that would cause confusion.
AC_PREFIX_PROGRAM(tex)

dnl Pass this down from the top level so that when the subprograms
dnl install kpathsea a command line value is propagated.
