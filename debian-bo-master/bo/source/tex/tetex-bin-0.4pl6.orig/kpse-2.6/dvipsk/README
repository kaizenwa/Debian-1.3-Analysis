This directory contains Dvipsk, my (kb@cs.umb.edu) modified version of
Tom Rokicki's dvips.


I will be convering dvips over to using fontinst fonts---soon.  I will also
be adding some new `standard' specials and context specials.  So things
will probably be changing a fair bit soon.  (Of course, I plan to maintain
full backward compatibility.)

If you enjoy using dvips, you will probably enjoy being a member of 
the TeX Users Group.  To join or contribute to TUG, contact them at

See `Makefile.in' for the version number.
See `NEWS' for changes by release.

The file `INSTALL' explains the installation process, which I changed to
use a GNU-style (Autoconf-generated) `configure' script to guess
system-dependent information, instead of requiring the installer to do
everything in the Makefile.

Aside from configuration, this differs from the original primarily in
that it uses the same code for path searching as TeX and my other
distributions. 

Please report bugs to tex-k@cs.umb.edu, rather than Tom, so he is not
bothered with bugs that aren't in his program.
Email tex-k-request@cs.umb.edu with a line containing

Dvipsk is free software; Tom's original files are public domain.  The
files I wrote (originally for the Free Software Foundation) are covered
by the GNU General Public License -- see the files COPYING*.

You can get the original dvips from labrea.stanford.edu:pub/dvips*.

config.ps is changed drastically from the original (which remains in
config.psr).  I also changed MakeTeXPK and psfonts.map in (I intended)
upward-compatible ways.

The documentation is now in Texinfo format.  I've removed the font
naming section, since it was an old version of the font naming document
(which you can get from ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex/fontname/fontname.texi).
