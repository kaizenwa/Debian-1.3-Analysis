Changelog (the main-line):
--------------------------
92-02: Start of ps2pk project
92-03: First release 1.0 (pre-release)
92-04: - added expansion and slanting features as suggested by Lee
         Hetherington (changes in ps2pk.c)
       - added encoding.c: encoding schemes `a la afm2tfm 7.0
       - default encoding is AFM encoding unless -e<enc> specified
       - added T1INPUTS (for font and afm-file) and TEXCONFIG (for 
         encoding) paths
92-05: AMIGA/Aztec
       - added Makefile.ami
92-05: - changed checksum calculation (matches now with afm2tfm/dvips5487)
       - fixed a bug in the type1 library (see ../type1/CHANGES)
       - added RB (pkin.c) and WB (pkout.c) definitions for binary
         input/output
       - added a tested Makefile.tcc for MSDOS TURBO/C, removed
         Makefile.dos
92-06: - added a Makefile.djg for MSDOS TURBO/GCC (Delorie's gcc386)
       - program name not longer derived from argv[0] (MSDOS expands this
	 name to full path)
       - ready to go ps2pk386.zip for MSDOS generated.
92-08: - added -a<AFMfile> option to ps2pk so Archimedes systems (which
         don't have extensions) can overule the name of the AFMfile.
         Reported by Roger Horne <rhorne@cix.clink.co.uk>
       - The X11R5 fixes for the Type1 rendering library (see
         ../type1/CHANGES) has changed PostScript character names like
	 "|doublequote|" into "doublequote". A number of patches were
	 needed to de-implement these |...| braces:
	   encoding.c:  type1string() replaced by string()
	   ps2pk.c:     omit test on '|' in checksum() 
       - <strings.h> replaced by <string.h> (conform ANSI standard)
       - added <stdlib.h> in mag.c.
94-01: Version 1.4 (bug fix release)
       - ./etc removed
       - ./Utopia: Utopia-Regular renamed as Utopia-Regular.pfa
       - ps2pk.c: TEXCONFIG environment variable removed
       - Makefile.*: updated and improved
       - Makefile.ami: removed
       - pkout.c/ps2pk.c: type of TFMwidth and h_escapement changed
         from unsigned to INT32 (Norman Walsh)
       - encoding.c: Gracefully handle character codes that are out of
         range (Norman Walsh)
       - pkout.c: memory allocation for pk_runlengths() made dynamically
         (bug reported by Norman Walsh)
============Revisions to make ps2pk14m
94-12: PK specials for internal identification of font added
	by P. A. MacKay (enhancement needed for TDS conformance.)
       - FontName and EncodingScheme extracted from afm file
	 in encoding.c
       - constants PK_SPC1 and PK_NUMSPC added to pkout.c
       - pk4() rewritten to match WEB coding and shut off complaints
	 by compiler.  New version should be 64-bit safe  (pkout.c)
       - major addition to pk_postamble() to write PK specials for
	 fontid, codingscheme, fontfacebyte, mag, mode, pixels_per_inch
	 and aspect_ratio. (pkout.c)
       - revised prototype for pk_postamble() in pkout.h
       - various computations to support PK specials.  Revised
         usage message, additional command-line options in ps2pk.c
       - manual page revised to reflect these changes and remove
         obsolete reference to TEXCONFIG.  Encoding file is found
	 through T1INPUTS environment variable.
95-01: Kpathsea path searching added. Can now be used with MakeTeXPK
       - most coding changes in ps2pk. If T1INPUTS is set, ps2pk
	 uses that exclusively.  If no T1INPUTS, uses kpathsea
	 for pfa, afm, and enc files.
	 (Paths must be set in texmf.cnf, no escape to environment.)
       - conflict with various GNU and system versions of basename()
         eliminated.  Function name changed to trim_basename().
       - clean exit provided for ps2pk (otherwise MakeTeXPK always fails.)
95-03: Provided with Makefile.in and configure.in for GNU configure.
