% texmf.cnf -- runtime path configuration file for kpathsea.
% 
% (If you change or delete `original' on the previous line, the
% distribution won't install its version over yours.)
% 
% What follows is a super-summary of what this .cnf file can
% contain. Please read the Kpathsea manual for more information.
% 
% texmf.cnf is generated from texmf.cnf.in, by replacing @var@ with the
% value of the Make variable `var', via a sed file texmf.sed, generated
% (once) by kpathsea/Makefile (itself generated from
% kpathsea/Makefile.in by configure).
% 
% Any identifier (sticking to A-Za-z_ for names is safest) can be assigned.
% The `=' (and surrounding spaces) is optional.
% No space, %, or @ in variable values, for the sake of autogeneration.
% An environment variable foo overrides a definition of foo here.
% $foo (or ${foo}) in a value expands to the envvar or cnf value of foo.
% 
% All definitions are read before anything is expanded, so you can use
% variables before they are defined.
% 
% If a variable is qualified with `.<program>', it is ignored unless the
% current executable (last component of argv[0]) is named <program>.
% 
% Which file formats use which paths for searches is described in the
% various programs' and the kpathsea documentation.
% 
% // means to search subdirectories (recursively).
% A leading !! means to look only in the ls-R db, never on the disk.
% A leading/trailing/doubled : in the paths will be expanded into the
%   compile-time default. Probably not what you want.


% Where the wild files are. You can set an environment variable to
% override this if you're testing a new TeX tree, without changing
% anything else.
TEXMF = /opt/texmf

% TeX input files -- i.e., anything to be found by \input or \openin,
% including .sty, .eps, etc.  Things are confused by the many variants
% of LaTeX, which all have the same filenames.  The current
% recommendation is to make `latex' be latex2e, and if you also want to
% support latex 2.09, call it latex209. If you do the reverse, the
% definitions below will need adjusting.
%
% [  Even before these we can set up for ps2pk.  None of the inputs for	]
% [  ps2pk can be made (We are not complicating things with pfb2pfa for	]
% [  the present) so TEXINPUTS is as good as any of the rubrics	below,	]
% [  and better than something like DVIPSHEADERS, which carries its	]
% [  own special baggage. Doing things this way makes it unnecessary to	]
% [  alter kpathsea in any way, at the price of getting only 2/3 of the	]
% [  functionality of kpathsea in this case.  We really don't need	]
% [  the other third, most of which is supplied by having ps2pk test	]
% [  for the environment T1INPUTS before making any use of kpathsea.	]
