* Usage message improved for SELFILE case.

18d (26 October 1994)
* New --with-ps={no,gs,dps,news} configure options; gs is still the default.
* The file selection can be cancelled.
* No complaints about finding 249 dpi if looking for 250.

18c (14 October 1994)
* Include SELFILE support by default.
* Support the `ps: <literal PostScript>' special.
* Support --help (and -help and +help).
* Convert both 330 and 328 dpi to 329 (magstephalf).
* Checksum warnings omitted if either the font or DVI checksum is zero.

18b (12 September 1994)
* Fixes for compilation with non-ANSI cc.

18a (8 September 1994)
* MakeTeXPK enabled by default.
* BoundingBox read from the file if not in the special.
* Better file closing when the file table is full.
* Links with the X11R6 libraries ICE and SM, if they exist.
* Update for xdvi 18.

1.8 (2 April 1994)
* Memory fault on `R' avoided when some fonts were not found.
* Always try closing files, instead of relying on errno==E[MN]FILE.
* EPSF files scaled with \magnification (thanks to Uwe Bonnes).
* Support for epsf decompression a la dvips (thanks to Karen Barrett).

1.7 (1 March 1994)
* Use DEFAULT_FIG_PATH, instead of DEFAULT_TEX_PATH (they are the same
  by default, anyway). 
* EPS displays take the magnification into account.
* EPS displays support the angle option from psfig 1.10.
* The Metafont mode for MakeTeXPK can be set via the command line, an X
  resource, an environment variable, or at compile-time.
* XDVIFONTS only overrides font paths, not all paths.
* SelFile support (thanks to Jon Peatfield).

1.6 (3 February 1994)
* No xdvi changes, just keeping up with the Kpathsea fixes.

1.5 (24 January 1994)
* Try again to make the signal handling more reliable on the Alpha.
* Debugging option for EPS previewing.
* Magstep rounding consistent with dvipsk.
* xdvi -version by itself doesn't provoke a usage message.
* Make j a synonym for j.

1.4 (3 November 1993)
* EPS handling (i.e., the gs invocation) more reliable on the Alpha.
* No segmentation fault when foreground=background.

1.3 (6 October 1993)
* mkdirchain invoked as an absolute filename.
* Fix compilation bug if -DMAKETEXPK.

1.2 (27 September 1993)
* Remove unnecessary backslash-only lines from dependencies in Makefile.
* Make -DGREY and -DTEXXET the default.
* Runtime control of whether MakeTeXPK is invoked.
* Support for drawing EPS files (using Ghostscript).

1.1 (26 August 1993)
* longjmp fix continues for the Alpha.

1.0 (5 August 1993)
* Rewrite font finding routines to use the new kpathsea facilities.
* Update for xdvi patchlevel 17.

0.30 (12 May 1993)
* Rewrite Makefiles etc. to use kpathsea as a separate library.
* Make icon name the DVI name, instead of `xdvi'.
