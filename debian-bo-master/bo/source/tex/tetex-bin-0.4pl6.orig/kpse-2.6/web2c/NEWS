This file records noteworthy changes.

Version 6.1 (3 February 1994)
* foo.bar found before foo.tex (found before foo).
* configure links sun.c to sun-sunview.c if SUNWIN is defined.
* -DLONG_64_BITS is supplied automatically (if appropriate).
* Various changes for configure --srcdir.
* Sample MakeTeX* scripts included.

Version 6.0 (24 January 1994)
* Default paths changed.
* Update for TeX 3.1415, etc.
* Change to use the kpathsea library, a la dvipsk and xdvik.

* TeX's \openin command invokes MakeTeXTeX just like \input.

* TeX & Metafont:
  - 16-byte values can be dumped, thus allowing native `long' on the DEC Alpha.
  - But 32-bit integers are used if sharable format files are desired,
    even on 64-bit machines.
  - Interrupts are accepted when waiting for input.
  
* Online output support in Metafont for Regis terminals and the NeXT.
* gftopk can handle characters with up to 100,000 rows.
* vftovp's -charcode-format=ascii works properly.
* patgen doesn't give bizarre numeric output where it should be text.

* configuration:
  - -lX11 is used for OpenWindows.
  - The MakeTeX... scripts are individually selectable by default, and
    can always be invoked if certain environment variables are set.
  - The subdirectory trick using st_nlink can be turned off.

* Makefiles:
  - man/Makefile doesn't remove itself at `clean'.
  - {tex,mf}/clean-tr[ia]p doesn't reinstall a {tex,mf}d.h with the test
     constants.
  - web2c/Makefile removes lex and yacc output at `clean'.
  - mkdirchain invoked as an absolute filename.

* web2c:
  - sync is no longer invoked; instead the Makefiles touch texd.h and
    mfd.h after they are finished.

Version 5.851d (22 February 1993)

* A file `texfonts.map' allows arbitrary mapping of font names (as given
  to, for instance, \font) to filenames.

* Metafont & TeX:
  - If a .tex, .tfm, or .mf file can't be found, MakeTeX{TeX,TFM,MF} is
    invoked before giving up, as in dvips' MakeTeXPK.
  - Sharable format/base files load faster on LittleEndian machines.
  - TEXMFOUTPUT is only used for those files which can't be written in
    the current directory, instead of all files after the first such.
    Its usage is also reflected in the `... written on ...' messages at
    the end of the run.
  - If the DISPLAY environment variable is set, Metafont assumes you are
    running under X11 for the purposes of online output (instead of
    relying on the TERM or MFTERM envvar).
  - Checks for write errors on DVI/GF output.
  - Unusual glue values no longer make TeX dump core on some systems.

* BibTeX:
  - The cross-reference feature works as documented (I had foolishly
    changed the default value of min_crossrefs to eliminate it).
  - New option -min-crossrefs=<number> to change it dynamically.
  - New option -verbose; without it, normal reportage is eliminated.
  - Maximum number of .bib files increased to 100.
  - Non-printable-ASCII characters in .bib files are preserved.

* TeXware:
  - tftopl adds a default extension `.tfm' to the input file if necessary.

* web2c: 
  - Unsigned types are used where possible to represent Pascal
    subranges.  Among other things, this eliminates a system dependency
    in creating format/base files (small_number was defined as `schar',
    which varies between systems).

* configuration:
  - Unpacks into web2c-<version> instead of src-<version>.*.
  - site.h merged into lib/c-auto.h.in and ./Makefile.in.
  - sed is used instead of patch to make the ``small'' change files.
  - sed is used instead of ed to make the trip/trap files.
  - The configure script looks in more directories for the X libraries
    and include files, and is generated from the latest version of Autoconf.
  - mfware and texware directories merged into the others.
  - The web2c version is defined in one place, so system information can
    be added to the banners more easily.

* Makefiles:
  - Makefiles in subdirectories are created by configure.
  - $(srcdir) (i.e., compiling in a different directory) is closer to working.
  - Stamp files are not used at the top level, or for {tex,mf}/convert.
  - New targets install-data and install-exec, to only install
    architecture-(in)dependent files.

* PROBLEMS.W2C has some notes on compiling and using these programs
  under DOS, contributed by melvin@math.psu.edu.

* The man pages have been significantly updated and improved by
  beebe@math.utah.edu.

* The original web files haven't changed.
