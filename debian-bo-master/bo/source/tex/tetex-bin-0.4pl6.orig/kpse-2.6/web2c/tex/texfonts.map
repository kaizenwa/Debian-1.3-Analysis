% First column is real filename; second is alias; others are ignored.
% Spaces and/or tabs separate columns.
% Blank lines are ignored.
% Comments (obviously) start with %.
%
% Null bytes will confuse the programs, and a CR at the end of a line is
% removed for DOS's sake, but any other characters will be considered
% part of the text, and any length is ok.
%
% If an alias here has an extension, it matches only those files with
% that extension; otherwise, it matches anything with the same root,
% regardless of extension.  For example, `foo.tfm' matches only
% `foo.tfm'; but `foo' matches `foo.vf', `foo.300pk', whatever.
%
% An existing file is preferred to a file found via an alias.  For
% example, if you have a file `foo.tfm' and this file defines `foo' as
% an alias for `bar', `foo.tfm' will be used, not `bar.tfm'.

% These fonts have been named both `circle10' and `lcircle10'.  But
% `lcirc10' is best, anyway, as it's short enough for DOS.  Allow any of
% these to mean any of the others.  --kb@mail.tug.org, 23 Jan 93.
