	* Makefile: discarded, will be regenerated from Makefile.in 
	during configure run.

	* Makefile.in: complete rewrite, based on ../mf/Makefile.in.

	* convert: replaced by modified version of ../mf/convert script.  
	Removed execute permission, using sh -c in the Makefile instead.

	* mp.def: discarded, using ../lib/texmf.defines instead.

	* mp.h: discarded, using the web2c header files from ../lib.
	(Actually moved to MPtime subdirectory for use in timing test.)

	* mpext.c: discarded, using routines from ../lib/lib.a instead.
	Moved code for callmakempx() to file ../lib/openinout.c.

	* mpmath.c: preserved without changes. Ccomments refererring to 
	site.h are no longer applicable when using ../lib/c-auto.h instead.

	* pathexp.c: moved to ../mpware as only DMP uses the pathexpand() 
	function. MetaPost and DVItoMP use Kpathsea routines instead.

	* fixcoerce.h: discarded, using ../mf/coerce.add instead.

	* fix.lex: discarded, apparently no longer needed in web2c-6.1.

	* ini_to_trap: discarded, using sed script trap.sed instead of
        shell script that invokes ed. Also added sed script small.sed.

	* trapdir: renamed to MPtrap, for consistency with ../mf/MFtrap.

	* trapmp: replaced by modified version of ../mp/trapenv script.
	Removed execute permission, using sh -c in the Makefile instead.
	Also rename etrapmp target to trapmp in the Makefile.

	* created subdirectory MPtime for timing test files not needed
	for production version of MetaPost. 

	* mp.h, test_mpd.h, mathtest.c, time.c, pmath.c: moved to MPtime.

	* mpmath.c: copied to MPtime and renamed to cmath.c for use in 
	timing test. Changed #include "mpd.h" to include "test_mpd.h".

	* site.h, defaults.h: copied from top-level directory to MPtime.
	Renamed site.h to site.h.orig and copied to site.h.{system-type}.
