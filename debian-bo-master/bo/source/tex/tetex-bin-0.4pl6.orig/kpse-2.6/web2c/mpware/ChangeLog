	* remved troffmpx.in and makempx.in and adjusted Makefile.
	For teTeX, all scripts are installed from bin-extra.

	* General: update of web2c-mp distribution for teTeX-0.3.4,
	including minor fixes already included in earlier texk-pretests.

	* dvitomp.ch: merged in fixes for `abs' vs. `fabs' confusion
 	already corrected in patch distributed with web2c-mp earlier.

	* newer.c: used version from texk-6.95, practically unchanged.

	* makempx.in, troffmpx.in: merged in some minor improvements
	from texk-6.95, but still avoided combining both versions in one.

	* mpto.c: used version from texk-6.95, serving as a replacement
 	for mptotex.c and mptotr.c.

	* dmp.c: used version from texk-6.95, compatible with kpathsea.

	* dmp.c, mpto.c: fixed silly bugs in option parsing that lead
	to segmentation faults when called without arguments.

	* Makefile: link dmp.o, mpto.o with $(commono) to resolve
	version string and kpathsea functions, depend on $(c_autoh).

	* makempx, troffmpx: replaced by templates makempx.in, troffmpx.in.
	The actual shell scripts are produced by sed, replacing @BINDIR@
	by the actual installation directory $(bindir), which is known to
	the Makefile when invoked as a sub-make from the top-level Makefile.

	* newer.c: include "c-auto.h" as a replacement for "site.h".

	* mptotex.c, mptotr.c: no changes needed. 

	* dvitomp.ch: complete rewrite, incorporating material from
	../dviutil/dviutil.ch and the original dvitomp.ch.

	* dmp.c: include "c-auto.h" as a replacement for "site.h".  
	Also include a special header file "dmp.h" containing MetaPost 
	specific stuff that isn't found in "c-auto.h".  Use MPSUPPORT
	instead of MPPOOL as the directory for troff support files.

	* dmp.h.in: added new template file for "dmp.h". The actual header
	file is produced by sed, repacing @TEXMF@ by the actual library
	directory $(texmf), which is known to the Makefile when invoked
	as a sub-make from the top-level Makefile.

	* pathexp.c: include "c-auto.h" as a replacement for "site.h".
	Use `#ifdef HAVE_DIRENT_H' and `#ifdef HAVE_STRING_H' instead
	of `#ifdef BSD'.  (There still remains one case of `#ifdef SYSV'
	that needs to be checked.)

	* Makefile: discarded, will be regenerated from Makefile.in 
	during configure run.

	* Makefile.in: complete rewrite, based on ../dviutil/Makefile.in.

	* convert: discarded, using ../lib/convert instead.

	* mpware.def: discarded, using ../lib/common.defines instead.

	* mpware.h: discarded, using the web2c header files from ../lib.

	* dvimpext.c: discarded, using routines from ../lib/lib.a instead.
