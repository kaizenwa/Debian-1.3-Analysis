.SH NAME
fontimport \- import fonts into the teTeX directory structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fontimport [\-d] [\-m MF\-mode] source
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fontimport
imports font files into the teTeX directory tree and copies them to their
appropriate places. With given
.IR -d
flag
the files are deleted in the other place afterwards.

.IR fontimport
tries to guess the mode of pk files. By the
.IR -m
flag you may specify a fallback mode that is used if the
guess fails.

.I fontimport
can cope with fontnames conforming the 8.3\-namescheme, too. So you can
import fonts from a TDS compliant or MSDOS installation into the teTeX
directories. emTeX's font libraries are not supported. If you want to
import	fonts from a font library, you need to unpack it with emTeX's
fontlib utility, first.
