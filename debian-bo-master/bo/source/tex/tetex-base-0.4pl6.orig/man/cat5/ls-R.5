NAME
       ls-R - database for common TeX input files

DESCRIPTION
       ls-R  is	 the  database for the teTeX binaries to speed up
       file finding. The file is located in the $TEXMF	directory
       (normally  $TETEXDIR/texmf)  and maintained by texhash(1),
       append_db(1) or (implicit) by  MakeTeXPK,  MakeTeXTFM  and
       MakeTeXMF.

       ls-R contains nothing more than an identification line and
       the output of an ls -LR command from within $TEXMF.
