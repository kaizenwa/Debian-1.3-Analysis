NAME
       alldc - force the most important DC-fonts to be calculated

SYNOPSIS
       alldc

DESCRIPTION
       alldc forces a large number of DC-style Fonts to be calcu-
       lated  as  pixel	 files.	  This	is  done  through running
       dvips(1) over a certain test-file.  Therefore,  the  fonts
       are created in the resolution needed by dvips.

       alldc  does not recalculate existing fonts (as long as the
       Metafont mode does not change).


SEE ALSO
       allcm(1), allneeded(1), fontimport(1), fontexport(1).
