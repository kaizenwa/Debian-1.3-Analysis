NAME
       tangle - translate WEB to Pascal

SYNOPSIS
       tangle webfile[.web] [ changefile[.ch] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  tangle  program converts a Web source document into a
       Pascal program that may be compiled in the usual way  with
       the  on-line  Pascal  compiler  (e.g., pc(1)).  The output
       file is all in lower case and  packed  into  lines  of  72
       characters  or less, with the only concession to readabil-
       ity being the termination of lines at semicolons when this
       can be done conveniently.

       The  Web	 language allows you to prepare a single document
       containing all the information that is needed both to pro-
       duce  a	compilable  Pascal program and to produce a well-
       formatted document  describing  the  program  in	 as  much
       detail  as the writer may desire.  The user of Web must be
       familiar with both TeX and Pascal.  Web	also  provides	a
       relatively  simple, although adequate, macro facility that
       permits a Pascal program to be written  in  small  easily-
       understood modules.

       The  command  line  should have either one or two names on
       it.  The first is taken as the Web file (and .web is added
       if  there  is no extension).  If there is another name, it
       is a change file (and .ch is added if there is  no  exten-
       sion).	The  change file overrides parts of the Web file,
       as described in the Web system documentation.

       The output files are a Pascal file and a string pool file,
       whose names are formed by adding .p and .pool respectively
       to the root of the Web file name.

       These last two are by far the largest extant  examples  of
       Web programs.

AUTHORS
       Web  was	 designed by Donald E. Knuth, based on an earlier
       system called DOC (implemented by  Ignacio  Zabala).   The
       tangle  and  weave programs are themselves written in Web.
       The system was originally ported to Unix	 at  Stanford  by
       Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.
