NAME
       patgen - generate patterns for TeX hyphenation

SYNOPSIS
       patgen	dictionary_file	  pattern_file	 log_file  trans-
       late_file

DESCRIPTION
       The patgen program reads the dictionary_file and	 produces
       the  pattern_file,  writing a transcript of its actions on
       the log_file.  The dictionary_file should contain  a  list
       of hyphenated words and previously-generated patterns.

       The  patterns thus generated can be read by initex for use
       in hyphenating words. For a (very) long	example	 of  pat-
       gen's			  output,		      see
       /usr/local/teTeX/texmf/tex/generic/config/hyphen.tex,
       which contains the patterns TeX uses for English.  At some
       sites, patterns for several other languages may be  avail-
       able,  and the local tex programs may have them preloaded;
       consult your Local Guide or your system administrator  for
       details.

       All  filenames  must  be	 complete;  no	adding of default
       extensions or path searching is done.

AUTHORS
       Frank Liang wrote  the  first  version  of  this	 program.
       Peter  Breitenlohner  made  a substantial revision in 1991
       for TeX	3.   The  first	 version  was  published  as  the
       appendix	 to  the TeXware technical report, available from
       the TeX Users Group. Howard Trickey originally  ported  it
       to Unix.
