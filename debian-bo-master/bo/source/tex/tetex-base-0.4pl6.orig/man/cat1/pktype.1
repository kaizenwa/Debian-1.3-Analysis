NAME
       pktype - translate a packed font file for humans to read

SYNTAX
       pktype pk_file_name [ output_file_name ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  pktype  program  translates	 a  packed font file (pk)
       (output by, for example, gftopk(1) to a file  that  humans
       can  read.  It also serves as a pk file-validating program
       (i.e., if pktype can read it,  it's  correct)  and  as  an
       example	of  a  pk-reading program for other software that
       wants to read pk files.

       The pk_file_name on the command	line  must  be	complete.
       Because	the resolution is part of the extension, it would
       not make sense to append a default extension  as	 is  done
       with  TeX  or DVI-reading software. If no output_file_name
       is specified, the output goes to the stdout.

       The output file gives a compact	encoding  of  the  packed
       encoding,  using conventions described in the source code.
       Run lengths of black pixels alternate  with  parenthesized
       run  lengths  of	 white	pixels,	 and brackets are used to
       indicate when a row should be repeated.

ENVIRONMENT
       pktype looks for pk_file_name using the environment  vari-
       able  PKFONTS.	If  that is not set, it uses the variable
       TEXPKS.	If that is not set, it uses TEXFONTS.  If that is
       not set, it uses the system default:
       !!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/pk/$MAKETEX_MODE//:!!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/pk/gsftopk//:!!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/pk/ps2pk//:/var/tmp/texfonts/pk/$MAKETEX_MODE//:/var/tmp/texfonts/pk/gsftopk//:/var/tmp/texfonts/pk/ps2pk//:.

       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.

AUTHORS
       Tomas Rokicki wrote the program.	 Donald E.  Knuth  origi-
       nally  ported  it  to  Unix.  Pierre MacKay adapted it for
       compilation with web2c.
