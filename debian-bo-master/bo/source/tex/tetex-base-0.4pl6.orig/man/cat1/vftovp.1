NAME
       vftovp  - convert virtual font (vf) files to virtual prop-
       erty lists

SYNOPSIS
       vftovp  [   -charcode-format=format   ]	 [   -verbose	]
       vf_file_name tfm_file_name [ vpl_file_name ]

DESCRIPTION
       The vftovp program translates a (program-oriented) virtual
       font file and its accompanying TeX font metric file  to	a
       (human-oriented)	 property  list	 file.	Thus, the virtual
       font can be edited, and its exact  contents  can	 be  dis-
       played mnemonically.  It also serves as a VF-file validat-
       ing program; if no error messages  are  given,  the  input
       files are correct.

       The  vpl_file_name  must be complete; no adding of default
       extensions is done.

OPTIONS
       The argument  format  to	 -charcode-format  specifies  how
       character  codes	 are  output in the PL file.  By default,
       only letters and digits are output  using  the  C  integer
       code  (i.e.,  in	 ASCII);  the others are output in octal.
       (Unless the font's coding scheme starts with TeX	 math  sy
       or  TeX	math  ex, that is, when all are output in octal.)
       If format is ascii, all character codes that correspond to
       graphic	characters,  besides the left and right parenthe-
       ses, are output in ASCII.  On the other hand, if format is
       octal, all character codes are output in octal.

       Without	the  -verbose  option,	vftovp operates silently.
       With it, a banner and progress report are printed on  std-
       out.

ENVIRONMENT
       vftovp  looks for vf_file_name using the environment vari-
       able VFFONTS.  If that is not set, it  uses  the	 variable
       TEXFONTS.  If that is not set, it uses the system default:
       !!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/vf//:.

       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.

AUTHORS
       Donald E. Knuth wrote the program, based	 in  part  on  an
       idea of David Fuchs, starting with the code for tftopl(1).
       Karl Berry adapted it for compilation with web2c.
