NAME
       lamstex - structured text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
       lamstex [ first line ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  LAmS-TeX  language is described in the book LAmS-TeX:
       The Synthesis.  LAmS-TeX is a  new  system  that	 augments
       AmSTeX with LaTeX-like features, but retains the syntacti-
       cal flavor of AmSTeX.  It can be compared  with	AmSLaTeX,
       which augments LaTeX with AmSTeX-like features.

       LAmS-TeX is a TeX macro package, not a modification to the
       TeX source program, so all the capabilities  described  in
       tex(1) are present.

       The  LAmS-TeX  macros encourage writers to think about the
       content of their documents, rather  than	 the  form.   The
       ideal,  not always realized, is to have no formatting com-
       mands (like ``switch to italic'' or ``skip 2  picas'')  in
       the  document  at all; instead, everything is done by spe-
       cific markup instructions: ``emphasize'', ``start  a  sec-
       tion''.
