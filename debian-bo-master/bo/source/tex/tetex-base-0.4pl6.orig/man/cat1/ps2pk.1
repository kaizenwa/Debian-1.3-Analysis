NAME
       ps2pk - creates a TeX pkfont from a type1 PostScript font

SYNOPSIS
       pk2pk [ options] type1 [pkfont]

       options: -v -eenc -Xxres -Eexpansion -Sslant

       options: -Ppointsize -Rbaseres -raspectratio

       options: -Yyres -aAFMfile -mmodename

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  renders  a given type1 PostScript font at a
       given  pointsize	 (default  10.0	 points)  and  resolution
       (default 300dpi) into a TeX pkfont.

       To  generate the pkfont pk2ps needs a valid type1 fontname
       (for example Utopia-Regular, Utopia-Regula.pfb or  Utopia-
       Regula.pfa)   and   its	corresponding  AFM-file	 (Utopia-
       Regular.afm).  The program accepts both the  MSDOS  binary
       type1  format (Utopia-Regula.pfb) and its ASCII equivalent
       (Utopia-Regular	or  Utopia-Regula.pfa).	  To  locate  the
       type1 font and its AFM-file ps2pk will use the environment
       T1INPUTS if it is set otherwise its built in default  (the
       -v flag will report which filenames are looked for).

       The  program  will  make	 a  pkfont in which the character
       codes are derived from  their  AFM  (Adobe  Font	 Metrics)
       defined	values.	  This	can be overruled by specifying an
       explicit encoding file via the -e  option.   The	 encoding
       file  enc  should contain a valid PostScript encoding con-
       taining PostScript names like /hyphen.  Here is an  incom-
       plete example (see afm2tfm for complete syntax):

	      % This is the EC encoding.
	      /ECEncoding [	     % now 256 chars follow
	      % 0x00
		/grave /acute /circumflex /tilde /dieresis /hungarumlaut
		/ring /caron /breve /macron /dotaccent /cedilla
		/ogonek /quotesinglbase /guilsinglleft /guilsinglright

		(Rest of lines omitted.)

	      % 0xF0
		/eth /ntilde /ograve /oacute /ocircumflex /otilde
		/odieresis /oe /oslash /ugrave /uacute /ucircumflex
		/udieresis /yacute /thorn /germandbls ] def

       Options and arguments:

       -aAFMfile   Overrules  the name that is used to locate the
		   AFM file.

       -eenc	   Name of a file containing an	 encoding  scheme
		   (default  - the encoding named in the AFM-file
		   is used).  The actual PostScript name  of  the
		   encoding  scheme  is written as a "special" at
		   the end of the pkfont.


       -Eextension The	extension  factor  (real  value,  default
		   1.0).


       -mmodename  A  modename	such as would be used by METAFONT
		   (default "Unknown mode").


       -Ppointsize The desired	pointsize  (real  value,  default
		   10.0 points).


       -Rbaseres   The	desired	 base  resolution (integer value,
		   default 300 dpi).  If this  differs	from  the
		   value  of  xres, the appropriate magnification
		   will be shown in the "specials" at the end  of
		   the	 pkfont.   If	possible,  this	 will  be
		   expressed as a magstep, otherwise  as  a  real
		   number.  For example, a pkfont with an xres of
		   329, using the default base resolution of 300,
		   will	    include	the	"special"    text
		   "mag=magstep(0.5)" at the end of the font.


       -raspectratio
		   The desired aspect  ratio  (expression,  inte-
		   gerY/integerX, default 300/300).  This will be
		   shown in the "specials"  at	the  end  of  the
		   pkfont.   Setting  the  aspect ratio creates a
		   value for yres but an explicit yres value will
		   take	 precedence.   Argument	 must be in "" if
		   spaces are left around `/'.


       -Sslant	   The slant (real value, default 0.0).


       -Xxres	   The resolution in  the  X  direction	 (integer
		   value, default 300 dpi).


       -Yyres	   The	resolution  in	the  Y direction (integer
		   value, default the value  of	 xres).	 If  yres
		   differs from xres, a "special" text giving the
		   aspect ratio will be written at the end of the
		   pkfont.

       -v	   Verbose  flag.  (Tells  what	 the  program  is
		   doing.)


       type1	   The name of the PostScript  type1  font.   The
		   name	 of the AFM-file will be constructed from
		   this	 name  by  removing  the  extension   (if
		   suplied)  and  adding  ".afm".  The PostScript
		   "FontName" is extracted from the AFM-file  and
		   written  into  a  "special"	at the end of the
		   pkfont.


       [pkfont]	   The name of the resulting pkfont can be  over-
		   ruled  with	this  name.   The default name of
		   pkfont is derived from  the	basename  of  the
		   type1 font, the pointsize and xres.	For exam-
		   ple `ps2pk -P17.28 Utopia-Regular' will result
		   in	`Utopia-Regular17.300pk'.    An	 explicit
		   value for the name of the pkfont is	necessary
		   when	 the  type1  font  name already shows the
		   point size, otherwise the pointsize	value  is
		   catenated  on  to the pkfont basename which is
		   usually not what is wanted.


       The following PK "specials" provide an internal	check  on
       the  characteristics of the pkfont, in accordance with the
       recommendations of the TeX Working Group on the TeX Direc-
       tory Standard (TWG-TDS):
       "fontid=FontName",   "codingscheme=Encoding",   "fontface-
       byte", "mag",  "mode=(ps2pk)modename",  "pixels-per-inch",
       and "aspect-ratio" if it is other than unity.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
       This program uses the type1 hinting and rendering software
       IBM has donated to the X-consortium.
