DESCRIPTION
       xdvi is a program which runs under the X window system. It
       is  used	 to  preview  dvi  files, such as are produced by
       tex(1).

       This program  has  the  capability  of  showing	the  file
       shrunken	 by  various  (integer)	 factors,  and also has a
       ``magnifying glass'' which allows one to see a small  part
       of the unshrunk image momentarily.

       Before  displaying  any page or part thereof, it checks to
       see if the dvi file has changed since the last time it was
       displayed.  If this is the case, then xdvi will reinitial-
       ize itself for the new dvi file.	 For this reason,  expos-
       ing  parts  of the xdvi window while TeX is running should
       be avoided.  This feature allows you to preview many  ver-
       sions of the same file while running xdvi only once.

       In  addition  to using keystrokes to move within the file,
       xdvi provides buttons on the right  side	 of  the  window,
       which are synonymous with various sequences of keystrokes.

       xdvi can show PostScript<tm>  specials  by  any	of  three
       methods.	 It will try first to use Display PostScript<tm>,
       then NeWS, then it will try to use Ghostscript  to  render
       the  images.   All  of  these options depend on additional
       software to work properly; moreover, some of them may  not
       be compiled into this copy of xdvi.

       For  performance	 reasons, xdvi does not render PostScript
       specials in the magnifying glass.   Furthermore,	 it  does
       not  yet	 support `!'  or `header=' specials.  If dvi_file
       is not specified, a file-selection widget is popped up for
       you to choose the dvi file from.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to	 specifying the dvi file (with or without

       the .dvi extension), xdvi supports the  following  command
       line  options.  If the option begins with a `+' instead of
       a `-', the option is restored to its  default  value.   By
       default,	 these	options can be set via the resource names
       given in parentheses in the description of each option.

       +page  Specifies the first page to show.	 If  +	is  given
	      without  a  number,  the	last page is assumed; the
	      first page is the default.

       -altfont font
	      (.altFont) Declares a default font to use when  the
	      font in the dvi file cannot be found.  This is use-
	      ful, for example, with PostScript <tm> fonts.

       -background color
	      (.background) Determines the  color  of  the  back-
	      ground.  Same as -bg.

       -bd color
	      (.borderColor)  Determines  the color of the window
	      border.

       -bg color
	      (.background) Determines the  color  of  the  back-
	      ground.

       -bordercolor color
	      Same as -bd.

       -borderwidth width
	      (.borderWidth) Specifies the width of the border of
	      the window.  Same as -bw.

       -bw width
	      (.borderWidth) Specifies the width of the border of
	      the window.

       -copy  (.copy)  Always use the copy operation when writing
	      characters to the display.  This option may be nec-
	      essary  for  correct  operation on a color display,
	      but overstrike characters will  be  incorrect.   If
	      greyscale anti-aliasing is in use, the -copy opera-
	      tion will disable the use of colorplanes	and  make
	      overstrikes  come out incorrectly.  See also -thor-
	      ough.

       -cr color
	      (.cursorColor) Determines the color of the  cursor.
	      The default is the color of the page border.

       +maketexpk
	      (.maketexpk)  Invoke  MakeTeXPK  to  create missing
	      fonts,  regardless  of  the  compile-time	 default.



X Version 11		 11 December 1994			2





XDVIK(1)						 XDVIK(1)


	      -maketexpk says not to invoke MakeTeXPK.

       -mfmodestring
	      (%%dot%%mfmode)  Use  string  for the Metafont mode
	      passed to MakeTeXPK. If this is not set,	the  `mf-
	      mode'  resource  is  used.  if that is not set, the
	      mode is left unspecified, which causes MakeTeXPK to
	      guess from the resolution.

       -d debugnum
	      (.debugLevel)  If nonzero, prints additional infor-
	      mation on standard output.  The number is taken  as
	      a set of independent bits.  The meaning of each bit
	      follows. 1=bitmaps; 2=dvi translation;  4=pk  read-
	      ing; 8=batch operation; 16=events; 32=file opening;
	      64=PostScript communication;  128=Kpathsea  stat(2)
	      calls;  256=Kpathsea hash table lookups; 512=Kpath-
	      sea path definitions; 1024=Kpathsea path expansion;
	      2048=Kpathsea searches.  To trace everything having
	      to do with file searching and opening, use 4000.

       -density density
	      (.densityPercent) Determines the density used  when
	      shrinking	 bitmaps  for fonts.  A higher value pro-
	      duces a lighter font.  The  default  value  is  40.
	      Same as -S.

       -display host:display
	      Specifies	 the  host and screen to be used for dis-
	      playing the dvi file.  By default this is	 obtained
	      from the environment variable DISPLAY.

       -expert
	      (.expert)	 Prevent the buttons from appearing.  See
	      also the `x' keystroke.

       -fg color
	      (.foreground) Determines	the  color  of	the  text
	      (foreground).

       -foreground color
	      Same as -fg.

       -gamma gamma
	      (.gamma)	Controls  the  interpolation of colors in
	      the greyscale anti-aliasing color palette.  Default
	      value is 1.0.  For 0 < gamma < 1, the fonts will be
	      lighter (more like the background), and for gamma >
	      1,  the  fonts  will be darker (more like the fore-
	      ground).	Negative values behave the same way,  but
	      use a slightly different algorithm.

       -geometry geometry
	      (*geometry)  Specifies  the initial geometry of the

XDVIK(1)						 XDVIK(1)


	      window.

       -hl color
	      (.highlight) Determines the color of the page  bor-
	      der.  The default is the foreground color.

       -hush  (.Hush)  Causes  xdvi  to suppress all suppressable
	      warnings.

       -hushchars
	      (.hushLostChars) Causes xdvi to  suppress	 warnings
	      about  references	 to  characters which are not de-
	      fined in the font.

       -hushchecksums
	      (.hushChecksums) Causes xdvi to  suppress	 warnings
	      about  checksum mismatches between the dvi file and
	      the font file.

       -hushspecials
	      (.hushSpecials) Causes xdvi  to  suppress	 warnings
	      about \special strings that it cannot process.

       -icongeometry geometry
	      (.iconGeometry)  Specifies the initial position for
	      the icon.

       -iconic
	      (.iconic) Causes the xdvi window to  start  in  the
	      iconic  state.   The  default  is to start with the
	      window open.

       -keep  (.keepPosition) Sets a flag to indicate  that  xdvi
	      should not move to the home position when moving to
	      a new page.  See also the `k' keystroke.

       -l     (.listFonts) Causes the names of the fonts used  to
	      be listed.

       -margins dimen
	      (.Margin) Specifies the size of both the top margin
	      and side margin.	This should be a  decimal  number
	      optionally  followed  by	``cm'', e.g., 1.5 or 3cm,
	      giving a measurement in inches or centimeters.   It
	      determines the ``home'' position of the page within
	      the window as follows.  If the entire page fits  in
	      the  window,  then the margin settings are ignored.
	      If, even after removing the margins from the  left,
	      right,  top,  and bottom, the page still cannot fit
	      in the window, then the page is put in  the  window
	      such  that the top and left margins are hidden, and
	      presumably the upper left-hand corner of	the  text
	      on  the  page will be in the upper left-hand corner
	      of the window.  Otherwise, the text is centered  in

XDVIK(1)						 XDVIK(1)


	      the  window.  See also -sidemargin, -topmargin, and
	      the keystroke `M.'

       -mgs size
	      Same as -mgs1.

       -mgs[n] size
	      (.magnifierSize[n]) Specifies the size of the  win-
	      dow  to  be  used	 for the ``magnifying glass'' for
	      Button n.	 The size may be given as an integer (in-
	      dicating	 that  the  magnifying	glass  is  to  be
	      square), or it may be given  in  the  form  widthx-
	      height.	See  the MOUSE ACTIONS section.	 Defaults
	      are  200x150,  400x250,  700x500,	  1000x800,   and
	      1200x1200.

       -noghostscript
	      (.noghostscript)	Inhibits  the  use of GhostScript
	      for displaying PostScript<tm> specials.

       -nogrey
	      (.grey)  Turns  off  the	use  of	 greyscale  anti-
	      aliasing	when printing shrunken bitmaps.	 (In this
	      case, the logic of the  corresponding  resource  is
	      the  reverse: -nogrey corresponds to grey:off; +no-
	      grey to grey:on.)	 See also the `G' keystroke.

       -nopostscript
	      (.nopostscript)	 Turns	  off	 rendering     of
	      PostScript<tm> specials.	Bounding boxes, if known,
	      will be displayed instead.  This option can also be
	      toggled with the `v' keystroke.

       -offsets dimen
	      (.Offset) Specifies the size of both the horizontal
	      and vertical offsets of the  output  on  the  page.
	      This should be a decimal number optionally followed
	      by ``cm'', e.g., 1.5 or 3cm, giving  a  measurement
	      in  inches  or centimeters.  By decree of the Stan-
	      ford TeX Project, the default TeX	 page  origin  is
	      always  1 inch over and down from the top-left page
	      corner, even  when  non-American	paper  sizes  are
	      used.  Therefore, the default offsets are 1.0 inch.
	      See also -xoffset and -yoffset.

       -p pixels
	      (.pixelsPerInch) Defines the size of the	fonts  to
	      use, in pixels per inch.	The default value is 600.

       -paper papertype
	      (.paper) Specifies the size of  the  printed  page.
	      This  may	 be  of the form widthxheight (or widthx-
	      heightcm), where width is the width in  inches  (or
	      cm) and height is the height in inches (or cm), re-

	      spectively.  There are also synonyms which  may  be
	      used:  us	 (8.5x11),  usr (11x8.5), legal (8.5x14),
	      foolscap (13.5x17), as well as the ISO sizes a1-a7,
	      b1-b7,  c1-c7,  a1r-a7r  (a1-a7 rotated), etc.  The
	      default size is 21 x 29.7 cm (A4 size).

       -rv    (.reverseVideo) Causes the  page	to  be	displayed
	      with  white  characters  on a black background, in-
	      stead of vice versa.

       -s shrink
	      (.shrinkFactor) Defines the initial shrink  factor.
	      The default value is 3.

       -S density
	      (.densityPercent)	 Determines the density used when
	      shrinking bitmaps for fonts.  A higher  value  pro-
	      duces  a	lighter	 font.	 The default value is 40.
	      Same as -density.

       -sidemargin dimen
	      (.sideMargin) Specifies the side margin (see  -mar-
	      gins).

       -thorough
	      (.thorough)  xdvi	 will  usually try to ensure that
	      overstrike characters (e.g.,  \notin)  are  printed
	      correctly.   On monochrome displays, this is always
	      possible with one logical operation, either and  or
	      or.   On color displays, however, this may take two
	      operations, one to set the appropriate bits and one
	      to  clear other bits.  If this is the case, then by
	      default xdvi will instead use the	 copy  operation,
	      which  does not handle overstriking correctly.  The
	      -thorough option chooses the slower but  more  cor-
	      rect choice.  See also -copy.

       -topmargin dimen
	      (.topMargin)  Specifies  the top and bottom margins
	      (see -margins).

       -version
	      Print information on the version of xdvi.

       -xoffset dimen
	      (.xOffset) Specifies the	size  of  the  horizontal
	      offset of the output on the page.	 See -offsets.

       -yoffset dimen
	      (.yOffset)  Specifies the size of the vertical off-
	      set of the output on the page.  See -offsets.

KEYSTROKES
       xdvi recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its



X Version 11		 11 December 1994			6





XDVIK(1)						 XDVIK(1)


       window.	Each may optionally be preceded by a (positive or
       negative) number, whose interpretation will depend on  the
       particular  keystroke.	Also,  the  ``Home'',  ``Prior'',
       ``Next'', and arrow cursor keys are synonyms for `^', `b',
       `f', `l', `r', `u', and `d' keys, respectively.

       q      Quits the program.  Control-C and control-D will do
	      this, too.

       n      Moves to the next page (or to the nth next page  if
	      a	 number	 is given).  Synonyms are `f', Space, Re-
	      turn, and Line Feed.

       p      Moves to the previous page (or back n pages).  Syn-
	      onyms are `b', control-H, and Delete.

       g      Moves  to the page with the given number.	 Initial-
	      ly, the first page is assumed to be page number  1,
	      but this can be changed with the `P' keystroke, be-
	      low.  If no page number is given, then it	 goes  to
	      the last page.

       P      ``This  is  page	number	n.''  This can be used to
	      make the `g' keystroke refer to actual page numbers
	      instead of absolute page numbers.

       Control-L
	      Redisplays the current page.

       ^      Move to the ``home'' position of the page.  This is
	      normally the upper left-hand corner  of  the  page,
	      depending	 on the margins as described in the -mar-
	      gins option, above.

       u      Moves up two thirds of a window-full.

       d      Moves down two thirds of a window-full.

       l      Moves left two thirds of a window-full.

       r      Moves right two thirds of a window-full.

       c      Moves the page so that the point currently  beneath
	      the  cursor  is  moved to the middle of the window.
	      It also (gasp!) warps the cursor to the same place.

       M      Sets  the margins so that the point currently under
	      the cursor is the upper  left-hand  corner  of  the
	      text  in	the  page.  Note that this command itself
	      does not move the image at all.  For details on how
	      the margins are used, see the -margins option.

       s      Changes  the shrink factor to the given number.  If
	      no number is given, the smallest factor that  makes



X Version 11		 11 December 1994			7





XDVIK(1)						 XDVIK(1)


	      the  entire  page	 fit  in the window will be used.
	      (Margins are ignored in this computation.)

       S      Sets the density factor to be used  when	shrinking
	      bitmaps.	 This  should  be  a number between 0 and
	      100; higher numbers produce lighter characters.

       R      Forces the dvi file to be reread.	 This allows  you
	      to  preview  many	 versions  of the same file while
	      running xdvi only once.

       k      Normally when xdvi switches pages, it moves to  the
	      home position as well.  The `k' keystroke toggles a
	      `keep-position' flag which, when set, will keep the
	      same position when moving between pages.	Also `0k'
	      and `1k' clear and  set  this  flag,  respectively.
	      See also the -keep option.

       x      Toggles  expert  mode  (in which the buttons do not
	      appear).	Also `0x' and `1x' clear and  reset  this
	      mode, respectively.  See also the -expert option.

       G      This key toggles the use of greyscale anti-aliasing
	      for displaying shrunken bitmaps.	In addition,  the
	      key  sequences  `0G'  and	 `1G'  clear and set this
	      flag, respectively.  See also the -nogrey option.

       If given a numeric arg that is not 0 or 1, greyscale anti-
       aliasing	 is  turned  on, and the gamma resource is set to
       the value divided by 100. E.g., `150G' turns on	greyscale
       and sets gamma to 1.5.

       v      This  key	 toggles  the rendering of PostScript<tm>
	      specials.	 If rendering is turned off, then  bound-
	      ing  boxes  are displayed when available.	 In addi-
	      tion the key sequences `0v' and `1v' clear and  set
	      this   flag,   respectively.   See  also	the  -no-
	      postscript option.

       F      Read a new DVI file (if the SELFILE file	selection
	      widget was not disabled at compile-time).

MOUSE ACTIONS
       If  the shrink factor is set to any number other than one,
       then clicking any mouse button will pop up a  ``magnifying
       glass''	which shows the unshrunk image in the vicinity of
       the mouse click.	 This subwindow disappears when the mouse
       button  is released.  Different mouse buttons produce dif-
       ferent sized windows, as indicated  by  the  -mgs  option.
       Moving  the cursor while holding the button down will move
       the magnifying glass.

       Also, the scrollbars (if present) behave in  the	 standard
       way:   pushing  Button  2  in a scrollbar moves the top or



X Version 11		 11 December 1994			8





XDVIK(1)						 XDVIK(1)


       left edge of the scrollbar to that  point  and  optionally
       drags  it; pushing Button 1 moves the image up or right by
       an amount equal to the distance from the button	press  to
       the upper left-hand corner of the window; pushing Button 3
       moves the image down or left by the same amount.

ENVIRONMENT
       Uses the environment variable DISPLAY to specify which bit
       map display terminal to use.

       The  environment variable XDVIFONTS determines the path(s)
       searched for fonts in the following  manner.   The  string
       consists	 of  one or more strings separated by colons.  In
       each such string, the substring %f is changed to the  font
       name;  %d  is  changed  to  the	magnification;	and %p is
       changed to the font file format (``pk'' or ``gf'').  If no
       %f  appears in the string, then the string ``/%f.%d%p'' is
       added  on  the  end.   For  example,  if	 the  string   is
       ``/usr/local/tex/fonts'' and the font is cmr10 at 300 dots
       per	inch,	   then	      it       searches	      for
       /usr/local/tex/fonts/cmr10.300pk			      and
       /usr/local/tex/fonts/cmr10.300gf, in that order.	 An extra
       colon  anywhere	in  XDVIFONTS  causes  the system default
       paths to be tried at that point.	 If the font is not found
       in  the	desired	 size,	then xdvi will invoke Metafont to
       create the font in the correct  size.   Failing	that,  it
       will  try to find the nearest size.  If the font cannot be
       found at all, then xdvi will try to vary the point size of
       the font (within a certain range), and if this fails, then
       it will use the font specified as the alternate font  (cf.
       -altfont).

       In  addition, a %F specifier is available; it is a synonym
       for %f,	but  it	 does  not  inhibit  putting  the  string
       ``/%f.%d%p''  at	 the  end.   Finally,  a  %b specifier is
       available; it is converted to the current resolution being
       used  (i.e.,  the  value	 of the -p parameter or the .pix-
       elsperinch resource.

       For compatibility with TeX, you may also use  TEXFONTS  in
       place  of  XDVIFONTS,  although	in that case the variable
       should not include any ``%'' specifiers.	 The  reason  for
       recognizing  TEXFONTS is that certain versions of TeX also
       support the convention regarding an  extra  colon  in  the
       font path; therefore, users who create their own fonts can
       put both their .tfm and raster files in the same directory
       and  do	``setenv  TEXFONTS  :MFdir'' or ``setenv TEXFONTS
       MFdir:'' in order to get both TeX and xdvi to search their
       directory  in addition to the system standard directories.
       The XDVIFONTS variable overrides the TEXFONTS variable, so
       that on those sites where TEXFONTS must be set explicitly,
       and therefore this feature is not  useful,  the	XDVIFONTS
       variable may be set to an empty string (i.e., ``setenv XD-
       VIFONTS'') to cause xdvi to ignore TEXFONTS.

XDVIK(1)						 XDVIK(1)


       xdvi also recognizes the	 PKFONTS  and  TEXPKS  variables,
       which are checked after XDVIFONTS but before TEXFONTS.

       The  XDVISIZES  environment variable may consist of a list
       of resolutions separated by colons, expressed  in  integer
       dots  per  inch.	 If a font cannot be found or made at its
       stated size, these sizes are tried as a fallback.  See the
       Kpathsea	 manual for more details.  xdvi will also try the
       actual size of the font before trying  any  of  the  given
       sizes.

       Virtual	fonts  are also supported, although xdvi does not
       have any built-in fonts to  which  they	can  refer.   The
       search  path for .vf files can be specified with the envi-
       ronment variable XDVIVFS in a similar manner to	that  for
       the  XDVIFONTS variable.	 xdvi will also check the VFFONTS
       variable if the XDVIFONTS variable is  not  set.	  Virtual
       fonts  are  searched for immediately after looking for the
       font as a normal font in the exact size specified.
