NAME
       dvilj4,	dvilj4l,  dvilj2p,  dvilj  - convert dvi files to
       PCL, for HP LaserJet printers

DESCRIPTION
       Dvilj and siblings convert TeX-output .dvi files	 into  HP
       PCL  (i.e.  HP Printer Control Language) commands suitable
       for printing on a HP LaserJet+,	HP  LaserJet  IIP  (using
       dvilj2p), HP LaserJet 4 (using dvilj4), and fully compati-
       ble printers.
       Dvilj4 also provides support for the  builtin  Intellifont
       and  TrueType  fonts; TFM and VF files are provided in the
       distribution.  Unfortunately, virtual fonts are	not  sup-
       ported directly, so you must run dvicopy(1) first.

       All  programs are generated from the same source dvi2xx.c.
       They are usually called by a shell script  or  as  a  line
       printer filter.


OPTIONS
       --Dnumber
	      Debug  according	to  the	 bits  of number; see the
	      Kpathsea manual for values. Also turns  on  general
	      verbosity.

       -cnumber
	      print each page number times (including original)

       -dnumber
	      print  in	 duplex	 mode.	The option -d1 means long
	      edge binding, -d2 stands for  short  edge	 binding.
	      This option is only selectable from dvilj2p, and is
	      known to works on a LaserJet IId or a LaserJet IIId
	      or LaserJet IV.

       -D
	      Double-sided  printing  - see below; -D1 prints odd
	      sides only, -D2 is for even  pages,  a  trailing	-
	      suppresses printing of empty padding pages.

       -E     Switch printer into econo mode (dvilj4 only)

       -eoutput file
	      default output filename is the basename of dvi file
	      and extension '.lj'.  The '-e' option can	 be  used
	      to  override  this default and to direct the output

	      to a different file.  If the output filename is set
	      to  '-`  (option	'-e-')	the output is directed to
	      stdout and can be directly piped into a spooler.

       -fpage number
	      start printing at top of given page number

       -g
	      go - do not reset printer at start of job

       -hheader file
	      headerfile to be copied before translation of  dvi-
	      file.   Used  to	send  arbitrary	 commands  to the
	      laserprinter.

       -l
	      landscape - print output in  landscape  mode.  This
	      option is supported only by dvilj2p and dvilj4.

       -Mflag Do (not) call MakeTeXPK. -M1 and -M are equivalent.
	      -M0 enables invoking MakeTeXPK. (This is	the  same
	      as dvips.)  The default behavior (i.e., if no -M is
	      given) is chosen at compile-time. This flag is only
	      valid if dvi2xx was compiled with support for Make-
	      TeXPK.

       -mmagnification
	      Specifiy the magnification to  use.  The	following
	      are available:
	      -m#usermag  e.g. #1200
	      -m0  equivalent to -m#1000
	      -mh  equivalent to -m#1095
	      -m1  equivalent to -m#1200
	      -mq  equivalent to -m#1250
	      -m2  equivalent to -m#1440
	      -m3  equivalent to -m#1728
	      -m4  equivalent to -m#2074
	      -m5  equivalent to -m#2488

       -pnumber of pages
	      print given number of pages

       -q
	      quiet operation

       -r
	      toggle  reverse/not  reverse  order for output.  By
	      default reverse=TRUE.

       -spagesize
	      Spezify pagesize
	      -s1:  executive	      (7.25in * 10.5in)
	      -s2:  letter	       (8.5in * 11in)
	      -s3:  legal	       (8.5in * 14in)

	      -s26: A4		       (210mm * 297mm)
	      -s80: monarch	     (3.875in * 7.5in)
	      -s81: commercial-10    (4.125in * 9.5in)
	      -s90: international DL   (110mm * 220mm)
	      -s91: international C5   (162mm * 229mm)
	      All values are from the LJ II  technical	reference
	      manual.  If the -s commandline option is omitted no
	      clipping is performed at the bottom of the page.

       -tpage number
	      print to end of given page number

       -v
	      verbose mode, list used fonts

       -w
	      print no warnings

       -xoffset
	      global x-offset in mm on output page relative to	1
	      inch/1 inch origin

       -yoffset
	      global  y-offset in mm on output page relative to 1
	      inch/1 inch origin

       -Xoffset
	      global x-offset in dots on output page  (to  set	1
	      inch/1 inch origin)

       -Yoffset
	      global  y-offset	in  dots on output page (to set 1
	      inch/1 inch origin)

       -z
	      print a test page with the page counter at  end  of
	      job

       -      Take input from stdin (must be seekable), output to
	      stdout.

       If no arguments are specified a short help file is dis-
	      played.


\special commands
       TeX '\special' commands that are implemented:

       \special{file=<filename>}
	      copy  specified file to the printer; either vector-
	      or bitmap-graphics PMP commands

       \special{hpfile=<filename>}
	      Same as `file'.

       others:
       There are a few other special commands implented	 for  the
       LJ-series,  which  should  only be used in connection with
       the distributed style files  (eg	 graybox.sty).	They  are
       likely to be changed in forthcoming versions.


Double Page Printing
       The  command line option -D causes the printer to print in
       doublepage mode, that is -  roughly  speaking  -	 printing
       first the even pagen and then the odd pages of a document.
       If -D is used to print both even and odd pages (-D is used
       without	the  optional  1  or 2) the following will happen
       after half of the pages is printed:

       LJ:    the  printer  stops,  shows  message   "FEED"   and
	      switches	on manual feed led. The printer continues
	      when either the printed pages are fed into the man-
	      ual  page	 feeder,  or the operator pushes the con-
	      tinue button (after placing first the printed pages
	      into the paper tray).

       If  -D1	was specified only odd pages will be printed, -D2
       can be used for even pages. A trailing  `-'  (as	 in  -D-,
       -D1-  or -D2-) supresses printing of empty pages which are
       generated for padding otherwise.

       The driver allows the -D option for both	 print-directions
       (front-to-back  or back-to-front printing). It tries to be
       clever in certain cases: when a document has an odd number
       of  pages it inserts in the right place an empty page when
       a document starts with page 0 the driver inserts an  empty
       page  after  the	 0-page	 when  a  piece	 of a document is
       printed that starts with an  even  page-number  it  prints
       this page at the backside of the first page to ensure that
       the odd sides are always on the frontside. The  0-page  is
       treated like an odd page.

       The  doubleside option works for all LJs, not only for the
       new D model with	 does  doubleside-printing  (actually,	i
       don't  know  wether it makes much sense on the new LJ II D
       at all).

       Caveat on the doubleside-option:	 When  it  is  used  fre-
       quently	or on very large files, it might become necessary
       to clean the printer much more frequently.

       The command line option -pX can be used to abort	 printing
       after  the  output of X pages (can lead to strange results
       together with -D). I personally dislike this  option.  The
       secure  way  of	printing a part of a document is using -f
       (from) and -t (to).

ENVIRONMENT
       The same environment variables and algorithms for  finding
       font  files as TeX and its friends do.  See the documenta-
       tion for the Kpathsea library for details.  (Repeating  it
       here is too error-prone.)

       DVILJFONTS, if set, overrides all other font paths.

       DVILJMAKEPK,  if set, overrides `MakeTeXPK' as the name of
       the command to execute to create a PK file  if  one  isn't
       found.

       The DVILJSIZES variable may be set to indicate which sizes
       of fonts are available.	It should consist of  a	 list  of
       numbers	separated  by  colons.	If the list begins with a
       colon, the system default sizes are used, as well.   Sizes
       are  expressed  in dots per inch; decimals may be used for
       ``pxl'' files: for example, a 300 dots per inch file  mag-
       nified  by  half	 a  step  comes out to 1643 dots per five
       inches, which should be encoded as 328.6.  dvilj tries the
       actual  size  of	 the  font before trying any of the given
       sizes.
