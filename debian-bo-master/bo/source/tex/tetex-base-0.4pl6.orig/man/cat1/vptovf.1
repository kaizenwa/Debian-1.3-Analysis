NAME
       vptovf  -  convert  virtual property lists to virtual font
       metrics

SYNOPSIS
       vptovf	[   -verbose   ]   vpl_file_name    vfm_file_name
       tfm_file_name

DESCRIPTION
       The  vptovf program translates a (human-oriented) property
       list file to a pair of (program-oriented) files in the  VF
       (virtual	 font) and TFM (TeX font metric) formats. Thus, a
       virtual font file can be edited and its exact contents can
       be  displayed  mnemonically.  New virtual fonts, which map
       characters as seen by TeX into an  arbitrary  sequence  of
       low-level  typesetting  operations, can also be created in
       this way.

       All three file  names,  vpl_file_name,  vf_file_name,  and
       tfm_file_name,  must  be	 complete;  no	adding of default
       extensions or path searching is done.

OPTIONS
       Without the -verbose  option,  vptovf  operates	silently.
       With  it, a banner and progress report are printed on std-
       out.

SEE ALSO
       pltotf(1), tftopl(1), vftovp(1).

AUTHORS
       Donald E. Knuth wrote the program, based	 in  part  on  an
       idea of David Fuchs, starting with the code for pltotf(1).
       Karl Berry adapted it for compilation with web2c.
