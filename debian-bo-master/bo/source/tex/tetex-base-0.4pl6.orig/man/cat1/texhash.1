NAME
       texhash - rebuild TeX-inputfiles-database

SYNOPSIS
       texhash

DESCRIPTION
       The binaries of teTeX use the file $TEXMF/ls-R as database
       for the locations of common input files. After adding  new
       input  files (fonts, style-files etc.) it is strongly rec-
       ommended to run texhash to update the database.

       The teTeX binaries may find files even if they are not  in
       the  database  (as  long	 as the !!-prefix to inhibit disk
       searching is not given for the relevant	path  component),
       but it will need very much longer!!!

       Pixel  fonts  that  are calculated during compilation of a
       tex or dvi file are added automatically to the database if
       possible.  Nevertheless, you should call texhash from time
       to time (e.g. through the cron-daemon ) to update the file
       completely.
