NAME
       gsftopk - render a ghostscript font in TeX pk format

SYNOPSIS
       gsftopk [-q] font dpi

ARGUMENTS
       font  Name of the font to be created.

       dpi   Desired  resolution  of  the  font to be created, in
	     dots per inch.  This may be a real number.

DESCRIPTION
       gsftopk is a program which calls up the	ghostscript  pro-
       gram  gs(1)  to render a given font at a given resolution.
       It packs the resulting characters into the pk file  format
       and  writes  them  to a file whose name is formed from the
       font name and the resolution (rounded to the nearest inte-
       ger).

       This  program  should normally be called by a script, such
       as xdvimakepk, to create fonts on demand.

       gsftopk obtains the character widths from the  .tfm  file,
       which  must  exist  in  the standard search path.  It also
       must be able to find a file psfonts.map (formatted  as  in
       dvips(1)), listing the available fonts.

OPTIONS
       -q     Operate quietly; i.e., without writing any messages
	      to the standard output.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       TEXFONTS	     Colon-separated  list  of	 directories   to
		     search for the .tfm file associated with the
		     font.  An	extra  colon  in  the  list  will
		     include  the  system  default  path  at that
		     point.  A double slash will enable recursive
		     subdirectory  searching at that point in the
		     path.

       DVIPSHEADERS  Colon-separated  list  of	 directories   to
		     search  for the ghostscript driver file ren-
		     der.ps and for  any  PostScript  font  files
		     (.pfa or .pfb files).  An extra colon in the
		     list behaves as with TEXFONTS.

       TEXCONFIG     Path to search  for  the  file  psfonts.map.
		     Only the first such file will be used.

BUGS
       gsftopk sometimes has trouble with fonts with very compli-
       cated characters (such as the Seal of  the  University  of
       California).   This  is	because gsftopk uses the charpath

       operator to determine the bounding box of each  character.
       If  the	character is too complicated, then it will exceed
       the allowable length of a path;	this  causes  gsftopk  to
       terminate with an error message

	      Call to gs stopped by signal 10

       (The number may vary from system to system; it corresponds
       to a bus error or a segmentation fault.)	 This is actually
       a design limitation in PostScript, exacerbated by a bug in
       ghostscript, rather than a bug in gsftopk itself.  To work
       around  this  bug,  gsftopk  can	 be instructed to use the
       bounding box  provided  with  the  font	(if  one  exists)
       instead	of finding a bounding box for each character.  To
       do this, include the string

	      /usefontbbox true def

       in the psfonts.map file; e.g.,

	      ucseal "/usefontbbox true def"

       This will not affect use of the font by dvips.
