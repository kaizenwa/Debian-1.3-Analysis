NAME
       pktogf - convert packed font files to generic font files

SYNOPSIS
       pktogf [ -v ] pk_file_name [ gf_file_name ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  pktogf  program converts a packed font file (pk) to a
       generic font  file  (gf).   Packed  font	 files	are  much
       smaller	than  the  corresponding  gf  files, but some DVI
       readers only understand gf files.

       The pk_file_name on the command	line  must  be	complete.
       Because	the resolution is part of the extension, it would
       not make sense to append a default extension  as	 is  done
       with   TeX   or	DVI-reading  software.	The  gf_file_name
       defaults to the same (stripped) name as pk_file_name,  and
       it  is placed in the current working directory with the gf
       suffix replacing pk.  For example, the input file io.300pk
       would become io.300gf.

OPTIONS
       Unless  the  -v switch is given, pktogf operates silently.
       With -v, the version number of the program and  statistics
       about the unpacking are output to stdout.

ENVIRONMENT
       pktogf  looks for pk_file_name using the environment vari-
       able PKFONTS.  If that is not set, it  uses  the	 variable
       TEXPKS.	If that is not set, it uses TEXFONTS.  If that is
       not set, it uses the system default:
       !!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/pk/$MAKETEX_MODE//:!!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/pk/gsftopk//:!!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/pk/ps2pk//:/var/tmp/texfonts/pk/$MAKETEX_MODE//:/var/tmp/texfonts/pk/gsftopk//:/var/tmp/texfonts/pk/ps2pk//:.

       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.
