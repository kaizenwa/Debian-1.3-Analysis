NAME
       dvitype - translate a dvi file for humans

SYNOPSIS
       dvitype dvi_file_name

DESCRIPTION
       The  dvitype program translates a DVI (DeVice Independent)
       file output by (for example) tex(1) or  gftodvi(1),  to	a
       file  that  humans can read. It also serves as a DVI file-
       validating program (i.e., if dvitype  can  read	it,  it's
       correct)	 and  as  an example of a DVI-reading program for
       future device drivers.

       The output file can include all commands, just the  impor-
       tant  ones,  or none at all (in which case only errors are
       reported).  A subinterval of pages  may	be  selected  for
       transliteration;	 the  magnification and resolution of the
       ``output device'' may be changed; and so on.  All  options
       are specified with an on-line dialog.

       The  dvi_file_name  on  the command line must be complete.
       The .dvi extension is not supplied if omitted. The  output
       goes to stdout.

ENVIRONMENT
       The  environment	 variable  TEXFONTS is used to search for
       the TFM files used in the DVI file.  See	 tex(1)	 for  the
       details of the searching.  If TEXFONTS is not set, it uses
       the system default:
       !!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/tfm//:/var/tmp/texfonts/tfm//:.

AUTHORS
       Donald  E.  Knuth  wrote the program.  It was published as
       part of the TeXware technical report, available	from  the
       TeX  Users  Group.  Howard Trickey and Pavel Curtis origi-
       nally ported it to Unix.
