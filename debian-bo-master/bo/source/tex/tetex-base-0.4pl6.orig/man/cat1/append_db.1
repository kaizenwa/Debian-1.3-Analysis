NAME
       append_db - add single entry to TeX-inputfiles-database

SYNOPSIS
       append_db filename location

DESCRIPTION
       The binaries of teTeX use the file $TEXMF/ls-R as database
       for the locations of common  input  files.   append_db  is
       used  internally	 by  MakeTeXTFM	 and  MakeTeXPK	 to add a
       freshly created font to the database.

       The teTeX binaries will find files even if they are not in
       the  database  (as long as they are in the standard search
       paths), but it will need very much longer!!!


SEE ALSO
       ls-R(5), texhash(1).
