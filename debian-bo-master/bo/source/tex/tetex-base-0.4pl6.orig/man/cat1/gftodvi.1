NAME
       gftodvi - make proof sheets from generic font files

SYNOPSIS
       gftodvi	[  -overflow-label-offset=real	]  [ -verbose ] [
       gf_file_name ]

DESCRIPTION
       The gftodvi program converts a generic font (gf) file out-
       put  by, for example, mf(1), to a device independent (DVI)
       file (that can then be typeset  using  the  same	 software
       that  has already been written for TeX). The characters in
       the gf file will appear one per page, with labels, titles,
       and  annotations	 as  specified	in  Appendix  H (Hardcopy
       Proofs) of The Metafontbook.

       gftodvi uses other fonts in addition to the main gf  file.
       A  `gray' font is used to typeset the pixels that actually
       make up the character. (We wouldn't want all the pixels to
       be  simply black, since then labels, key points, and other
       information would be lost.)  A `title' font  is	used  for
       the  information at the top of the page. A `label' font is
       used for the labels on key points of the figure. A `slant'
       font  is	 used  to typeset diagonal lines, which otherwise
       have to be simulated using horizontal and vertical  rules.
       The  default  gray, title, and label fonts are gray, cmr8,
       and cmtt10, respectively; there is no default slant  font.

       To change the default fonts, you can give special commands
       in your Metafont source file, or you can change the  fonts
       online.	 An   online   dialog	ensues	if  you	 end  the
       gf_file_name with a `/'. For example,
	 gftodvi cmr10.300gf/
	 Special font substitution: grayfont black
	 OK; any more? grayfontarea /home/art/don/
	 OK; any more? slantfont /home/fonts/slantimagen6
	 OK; any more? <RET>
       will  use  /home/art/don/black  as  the	`gray'	font  and
       /home/fonts/slantimagen6	 as  the  `slant' font (this name
       indicates a font for lines with slope 1/6 at  the  resolu-
       tion of an Imagen printer).

       The  gf_file_name  on  the  command line must be complete.
       (The program prompts you for it if  you	don't  give  it.)
       Because	the resolution is part of the extension, it would
       not make sense to append a default extension  as	 is  done
       with  TeX  or  DVI-reading  software. The output file name
       defaults to the same root as the gf  file,  with	 the  dvi
       extension  added. For example, the input file cmr10.2602gf
       would become cmr10.dvi.

OPTIONS
       The argument to -overflow-label-offset specifies the  dis-
       tance from the right edge of the character bounding box at

       which the overflow equations (if any)  are  typeset.   The
       value  is  given	 in  TeX points.  The default is a little
       over two inches.

       Without the -verbose option,  gftodvi  operates	silently.
       With  it, a banner and progress report are printed on std-
       out.

ENVIRONMENT
       gftodvi looks for gf_file_name using the environment vari-
       able  GFFONTS.	If  that is not set, it uses the variable
       TEXFONTS. If that is not set, it uses the system default:
       .

       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.
