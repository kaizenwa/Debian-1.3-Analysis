NAME
       pltotf  -  convert  property list files to TeX font metric
       (tfm) format

SYNOPSIS
       pltotf [ -verbose ] pl_file_name tfm_file_name

DESCRIPTION
       The pltotf program translates a (human-oriented) Web prop-
       erty  list  file	 to  a (program-oriented) TeX font metric
       file. Thus, after editing the property list  file,  a  TFM
       file can be generated for use with, for example, tex(1).

       Both  the  pl_file_name and the tfm_file_name must be com-
       plete; no adding of default extensions or  path	searching
       is done.

OPTIONS
       Without	the  -verbose  option,	pltotf operates silently.
       With it, a banner and progress report are printed on  std-
       out.
