NAME
       amstex - structured text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
       amstex [ first line ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  AmSTeX  language  is described in the book The Joy of
       TeX.  AmSTeX is a TeX macro package, not a modification to
       the  TeX source program, so all the capabilities described
       in tex(1) are present.

       The AmSTeX macros encourage writers  to	think  about  the
       content	of  their  documents,  rather than the form.  The
       ideal, not always realized, is to have no formatting  com-
       mands  (like  ``switch to italic'' or ``skip 2 picas'') in
       the document at all; instead, everything is done	 by  spe-
       cific  markup  instructions: ``emphasize'', ``start a sec-
       tion''.

       AmSTeX is the official typesetting system of the	 American
       Mathematical  Society,  and nearly all of its publications
       are typeset using AmSTeX.  The online version of AMS  Math
       Reviews uses AmSTeX input syntax for display of mathemati-
       cal material.  AMS authors can provide editors  with  com-
       puter-readable AmSTeX files.

       For  authors  more  familiar  with LaTeX, an AMS-supported
       variant called AmSLaTeX is available.
