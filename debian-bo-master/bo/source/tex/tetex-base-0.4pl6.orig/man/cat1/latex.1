NAME
       latex - structured text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
       latex [ first line ]

DESCRIPTION
       The LaTeX language is described in the book LaTeX - A Doc-
       ument Preparation System.  LaTeX is a TeX  macro	 package,
       not  a  modification to the TeX source program, so all the
       capabilities described in tex(1) are present.

       The LaTeX macros encourage writers to think about the con-
       tent of their documents, rather than the form.  The ideal,
       very difficult to realize, is to have no	 formatting  com-
       mands  (like  ``switch to italic'' or ``skip 2 picas'') in
       the document at all; instead, everything is done	 by  spe-
       cific  markup  instructions: ``emphasize'', ``start a sec-
       tion''.

       The primary source of documentation for LaTeX is the LaTeX
       manual  referenced  below, and the local guide in the file
       local-guide.tex or local.tex or some such somewhere in the
       directory /usr/local/teTeX/texmf/tex.
