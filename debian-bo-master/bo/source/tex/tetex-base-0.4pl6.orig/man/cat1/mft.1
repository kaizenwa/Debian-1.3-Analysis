NAME
       mft - translate Metafont code to TeX code for prettyprint-
       ing

SYNOPSIS
       mft mf_file_name[.mf] [ [ -c ] or [  change_file_name[.ch]
       ] ] [ [ -s ] or [ style_file_name[.mft] ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  mft	 program  creates a TeX file from a Metafont pro-
       gram.  It takes appropriate care	 of  typographic  details
       like  page  layout  and	the  use of indentation, italics,
       boldface, etc., as illustrated in the book Computer Modern
       Typefaces.  Special conventions in Metafont comments allow
       you to control things that would not  otherwise	come  out
       right;  section	1  of the MFT source program in the Meta-
       fontware report explains these rules.

       The command line	 has  one  required  file  name	 and  two
       optional	 file  names.	The  required  one  is a Metafont
       source file; there is also an optional change file  (which
       works  just  as the change files to tangle(1) and weave(1)
       do) and an optional style  file	(which	is  prepended  to
       everything).

       A  file name that doesn't contain a dot is always given an
       extension, either .mf (Metafont) or .ch (change)	 or  .mft
       (style).	 If  no	 style	file is specified, the style file
       plain.mft is automatically used. The  change_file_name  is
       not searched for using any paths. The .mf file is searched
       for using the MFINPUTS environment variable  if	you  have
       set it, or else the system default:
       .:!!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/metafont//:!!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/source//:/var/tmp/texfonts/source//
       The style file is searched for using the	 TEXINPUTS  envi-
       ronment variable; its default value is:
       .:!!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/tex//
       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.

       The  output TeX file name is formed by using .tex in place
       of the extension of mf_file_name.

OPTIONS
       Specify command-line options -c to suppress the reading of
       a  change  file, and -s to suppress the reading of a style
       file.

AUTHORS
       Donald E. Knuth wrote the program, and  he  ported  it  to
       Unix  with  the help of Pierre MacKay and the Unix port of
       weave by Howard Trickey and Pavel Curtis.  The program  is
       published  in the Metafontware technical report, available
       from the TeX Users Group.
