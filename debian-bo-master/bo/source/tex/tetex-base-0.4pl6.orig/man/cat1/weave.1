NAME
       weave - translate WEB to TeX

SYNOPSIS
       weave [ -x ] webfile[.web] [ changefile[.ch] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The weave program is used to create a TeX file for viewing
       a Web program.  It takes appropriate care  of  typographic
       details like page layout and the use of indentation, ital-
       ics, boldface, etc., and it supplies extensive cross-index
       information  that  it  gathers automatically.  The command
       line arguments are the same as for tangle except	 for  the
       option:	-x  says to omit the index, module name list, and
       table of contents pages.	 (A CONTENTS.tex file will  still
       be written when the TeX file is processed, however, unless
       some macros in webmac.tex are redefined.)

       The output TeX file name is formed by adding .tex  to  the
       root of the Web file name.

       There are several macros that probably should be redefined
       by the programmer at the beginning of the Web file.  It is
       a  good	idea  to  set  \title to the name of the program.
       And, to cause output of only changed modules, one can  say
       \let\maybe=\iffalse  (usually  as  the first change in the
       change file).
