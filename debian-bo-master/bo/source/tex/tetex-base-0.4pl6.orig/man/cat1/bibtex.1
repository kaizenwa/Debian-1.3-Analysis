NAME
       bibtex - make a bibliography for (La)TeX

SYNOPSIS
       bibtex [ -min-crossrefs=number ] [ -verbose ] [ auxname ]

DESCRIPTION
       BibTeX  reads the top-level auxiliary (.aux) file that was
       output during the running of latex(1) or tex(1)	and  cre-
       ates  a bibliography (.bbl) file that will be incorporated
       into the document on subsequent runs of LaTeX or TeX.  The
       auxname on the command line must be given without the .aux
       extension.  If you don't give  the  auxname,  the  program
       prompts you for it.

       BibTeX  looks  up,  in bibliographic database (.bib) files
       specified by the \bibliography command, the entries speci-
       fied by the \cite and \nocite commands in the LaTeX or TeX
       source  file.   It  formats  the	 information  from  those
       entries	according to instructions in a bibliography style
       (.bst) file (specified by the \bibliographystyle	 command,
       and it outputs the results to the .bbl file.

       The  LaTeX  manual  explains what a LaTeX source file must
       contain to work with BibTeX.  Appendix  B  of  the  manual
       describes  the  format  of the .bib files. The `BibTeXing'
       document describes extensions and details of this  format,
       and it gives other useful hints for using BibTeX.

OPTIONS
       The  -min-crossrefs  option  defines the minimum number of
       crossref required for automatic inclusion  of  the  cross-
       ref'd  entry  on	 the  citation	list; the default is two.
       Without the -verbose  option,  BibTeX  operates	silently.
       With it, a banner and progress reports are printed on std-
       out.


ENVIRONMENT
       BibTeX searches the directories in the path defined by the
       BSTINPUTS  environment  variable for .bst files. If BSTIN-
       PUTS is not set, it uses TEXINPUTS; and	if  TEXINPUTS  is
       not set, it uses the system default:
       .:!!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/bibtex/bst//
       For .bib files, it uses the BIBINPUTS environment variable
       if that is set, otherwise the default:
       .:!!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/bibtex/bib//
       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.

       If the environment variable  TEXMFOUTPUT	 is  set,  BibTeX
       attempts	 to put its output files in it, if they cannot be
       put in the current directory.  Again, see tex(1).  No spe-
       cial searching is done for the .aux file.

       *.bst	    Bibliography style files.

       btxdoc.tex   ``BibTeXing''  -  LaTeXable documentation for
		    general BibTeX users

       btxhak.tex   ``Designing BibTeX Styles'' - LaTeXable docu-
		    mentation for style designers

       btxdoc.bib   database file for those two documents

       describes  the  web2c  version  of BibTeX.  Other ports of
       BibTeX, such as Donald Knuth's version using the Sun  Pas-
