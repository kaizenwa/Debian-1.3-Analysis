NAME
       allneeded - force the calculation of all fonts now needed

SYNOPSIS
       allneeded [-r] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       allneeded  forces  the  calculation  of all fonts that are
       needed  to  preview  any	 document  below  /usr	or  /home
       immideately.   This  is done through running dvips(1) over
       all accessible dvi-files. Therefore, the fonts are created
       in the resolution needed by dvips.

       allneeded  does not recalculate existing fonts (as long as
       the Metafont mode does not change).
