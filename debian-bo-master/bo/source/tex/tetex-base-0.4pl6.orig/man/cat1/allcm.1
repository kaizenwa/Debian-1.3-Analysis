NAME
       allcm  - force the most important Computer-Modern-fonts to
       be calculated

SYNOPSIS
       allcm

DESCRIPTION
       allcm forces a large number of Computer Modern Fonts to be
       calculated  as  pixel files.  This is done through running
       dvips(1) over a certain test-file.  Therefore,  the  fonts
       are created in the resolution needed by dvips.

       alldc  does not recalculate existing fonts (as long as the
       Metafont mode does not change).


SEE ALSO
       alldc(1), allneeded(1), fontimport(1), fontexport(1).
