NAME
       tftopl  -  convert TeX font metric (tfm) files to property
       lists

SYNOPSIS
       tftopl  [   -charcode-format=format   ]	 [   -verbose	]
       tfm_file_name [ pl_file_name ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  tftopl  program  translates a (program-oriented) font
       metric file to  a  (human-oriented)  property  list  file.
       Thus,  you  can edit the contents of the TFM files, if the
       font designer has not done his or her job properly, or  if
       you're  encountering  strange  difficulties,  or if you're
       just curious.  It also serves  as  a  TFM-file  validating
       program,	 i.e.,	if no error messages are given, the input
       file is correct.

       The pl_file_name must be complete; no  adding  of  default
       extensions or path searching is done.  If the pl_file_name
       is not given, standard output is used.  The  tfm_file_name
       is  extended  with  .tfm if it lacks a suffix.  Also, path
       searching is done for the .tfm file using the  environment
       variable	 TEXFONTS.   If	 that is not set, tftopl uses the
       system default:
       !!/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/fonts/tfm//:/var/tmp/texfonts/tfm//:.

       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.

OPTIONS
       The  argument  format  to  -charcode-format  specifies how
       character codes are output in the PL  file.   By	 default,
       only  letters  and  digits  are output using the C integer
       code (i.e., in ASCII); the others  are  output  in  octal.
       (Unless	the  font's coding scheme starts with TeX math sy
       or TeX math ex, in which case all character codes are out-
       put  in	octal.)	  If format is ascii, all character codes
       that correspond to graphic characters,  besides	the  left
       and  right  parentheses, are output in ASCII.  Finally, if
       format is octal, all character codes are output in  octal.

       Without	the  -verbose  option,	tftopl operates silently.
       With it, a banner and progress report are printed on  std-
       out.
