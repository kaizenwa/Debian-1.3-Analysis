NAME
       fontimport  - import fonts into the teTeX directory struc-
       ture

SYNOPSIS
       fontimport [-d] [-m MF-mode] source

DESCRIPTION
       fontimport imports font files  into  the	 teTeX	directory
       tree  and  copies  them	to their appropriate places. With
       given -d flag the files are deleted  in	the  other  place
       afterwards.

       fontimport  tries to guess the mode of pk files. By the -m
       flag you may specify a fallback mode that is used  if  the
       guess fails.

       fontimport   can	  cope	 with  fontnames  conforming  the
       8.3-namescheme, too. So you can import fonts  from  a  TDS
       compliant  or  MSDOS  installation into the teTeX directo-
       ries. emTeX's font libraries are	 not  supported.  If  you
       want  to	 import	   fonts from a font library, you need to
       unpack it with emTeX's fontlib utility, first.
