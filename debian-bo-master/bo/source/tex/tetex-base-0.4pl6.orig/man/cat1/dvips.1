NAME
       dvips - convert a TeX DVI file to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       dvips [ options ] file[.dvi]

DESCRIPTION
       THIS  MAN PAGE IS OBSOLETE!  See the Texinfo documentation
       instead.	 You can read it either	 in  Emacs  or	with  the
       standalone  info	 program which comes with the GNU texinfo
       distribution.

       The program dvips takes a DVI file file[.dvi] produced  by
       TeX  (or by some other processor such as GFtoDVI) and con-
       verts  it  to  PostScript,  normally  sending  the  result
       directly	 to the laserprinter.  The DVI file may be speci-
       fied without the .dvi extension.	 Fonts used may either be
       resident in the printer or defined as bitmaps in PK files,
       or a `virtual' combination of both.  If the MakeTeXPK pro-
       gram  is	 installed, dvips will automatically invoke META-
       FONT to generate fonts that don't already exist.

       For more information, see the Texinfo  manual  dvips.texi,
       which should be installed somewhere on your system.

OPTIONS
       -a     Conserve	memory	by  making  three passes over the
	      .dvi file instead of two	and  only  loading  those
	      characters actually used.	 Generally only useful on
	      machines with a very limited amount of memory, like
	      some PCs.

       -A     Print  only  odd	pages  (TeX  pages,  not sequence
	      pages).

       -b num Generate num copies of each page,	 but  duplicating
	      the  page	 body  rather  than  using the #numcopies
	      option.  This can be useful in conjunction  with	a
	      header  file  setting \bop-hook to do color separa-
	      tions or other neat tricks.

       -B     Print only even  pages  (TeX  pages,  not	 sequence
	      pages).

       -c num Generate	num  copies of every page.  Default is 1.
	      (For collated copies, see the -C option below.)

       -C num Create num copies, but collated (by replicating the
	      data  in	the PostScript file).  Slower than the -c
	      option, but easier on the hands,	and  faster  than
	      resubmitting  the	 same  PostScript  file	 multiple
	      times.

       -d num Set the debug flags.  This  is  intended	only  for

	      emergencies  or  for  unusual  fact-finding expedi-
	      tions; it will work only if dvips has been compiled
	      with  the	 DEBUG	option.	  For more information on
	      possible values see section 15 of dvips.tex.

       -D num Set the resolution in dpi (dots per inch)	 to  num.
	      This  affects  the  choice of bitmap fonts that are
	      loaded and also the positioning of letters in resi-
	      dent  PostScript	fonts.	Must  be  between  10 and
	      10000.  This affects both the horizontal and verti-
	      cal  resolution.	 If  a high resolution (something
	      greater than 400 dpi, say) is selected, the -Z flag
	      should probably also be used.

       -e num Make  sure  that	each  character is placed at most
	      this  many  pixels  from	its  `true'   resolution-
	      independent position on the page. The default value
	      of this parameter is resolution dependent.   Allow-
	      ing  individual  characters  to  `drift' from their
	      correctly rounded positions by a few pixels,  while
	      regaining	 the  true  position  at the beginning of
	      each new word, improves the spacing of  letters  in
	      words.

       -E     makes dvips attempt to generate an EPSF file with a
	      tight bounding box.  This only  works  on	 one-page
	      files,  and  it only looks at marks made by charac-
	      ters and rules, not by any included  graphics.   In
	      addition,	 it  gets  the glyph metrics from the tfm
	      file, so characters that lie outside their  enclos-
	      ing  tfm	box  may  confuse  it.	 In addition, the
	      bounding box might be a bit too loose if the  char-
	      acter  glyph  has	 significant  left  or right side
	      bearings.	 Nonetheless, this option works well  for
	      creating	small  EPSF files for equations or tables
	      or the like.  (Note, of course, that  dvips  output
	      is resolution dependent and thus does not make very
	      good EPSF files, especially if the images are to be
	      scaled;  use  these EPSF files with a great deal of
	      care.)

       -f     Read the .dvi file from standard	input  and  write
	      the  PostScript  to  standard output.  The standard
	      input must be seekable, so it cannot be a pipe.  If
	      you  must	 use  a	 pipe,	write a shell script that
	      copies the pipe output to a temporary file and then
	      points  dvips  at this file.  This option also dis-
	      ables the automatic reading of the PRINTER environ-
	      ment  variable, and turns off the automatic sending
	      of control D if it was turned on with the -F option
	      or  in  the  configuration  file; use -F after this
	      option if you want both.

       -F     Causes Control-D (ASCII code 4) to be  appended  as

	      the  very	 last  character  of the PostScript file.
	      This is useful when dvips is  driving  the  printer
	      directly	instead	 of working through a spooler, as
	      is common on extremely small systems.  NOTE! DO NOT
	      USE THIS OPTION!

       -h name
	      Prepend  file  name  as  an additional header file.
	      (However, if the name is simply  `-'  suppress  all
	      header  files  from  the output.)	 This header file
	      gets added to the PostScript userdict.

       -i     Make each section be a separate file.   Under  cer-
	      tain  circumstances,  dvips will split the document
	      up into `sections' to be	processed  independently;
	      this  is most often done for memory reasons.  Using
	      this option tells dvips to place each section  into
	      a	 separate  file;  the  new file names are created
	      replacing the suffix of the  supplied  output  file
	      name by a three-digit sequence number.  This option
	      is most often  used  in  conjunction  with  the  -S
	      option  which  sets  the	maximum section length in
	      pages.  For instance, some phototypesetters  cannot
	      print  more than ten or so consecutive pages before
	      running out of steam; these options can be used  to
	      automatically  split a book into ten-page sections,
	      each to its own file.

       -k     Print crop marks.	 This option increases the  paper
	      size  (which  should  be	specified,  either with a
	      paper size special or with the -T option) by a half
	      inch in each dimension.  It translates each page by
	      a quarter inch and draws	cross-style  crop  marks.
	      It  is  mostly useful with typesetters that can set
	      the page size automatically.

       -K     This option causes comments in included  PostScript
	      graphics,	 font  files,  and headers to be removed.
	      This is sometimes necessary to get around	 bugs  in
	      spoolers	or  PostScript	post-processing programs.
	      Specifically, the %%Page comments,  when	left  in,
	      often  cause  difficulties.   Use	 of this flag can
	      cause some included graphics  to	fail,  since  the
	      PostScript  header  macros from some software pack-
	      ages read portions of  the  input	 stream	 line  by
	      line,  searching	for  a	particular comment.  This
	      option has  been	turned	off  by	 default  because
	      PostScript  previewers  and spoolers have been get-
	      ting better.

       -l num The last page printed will be the	 first	one  num-
	      bered num Default is the last page in the document.
	      If the num is prefixed by an equals sign,	 then  it
	      (and any argument to the -p option) is treated as a

	      sequence number, rather than  a  value  to  compare
	      with  \count0  values.   Thus, using -l =9 will end
	      with the ninth page of the document, no matter what
	      the pages are actually numbered.

       -m     Specify manual feed for printer.

       -M     Turns  off  the automatic font generation facility.
	      If any fonts are missing, commands to generate  the
	      fonts  are appended to the file missfont.log in the
	      current directory; this file can then  be	 executed
	      and deleted to create the missing fonts.

       -n num At  most	num  pages  will  be  printed. Default is
	      100000.

       -N     Turns off structured comments; this might be neces-
	      sary   on	  some	systems	 that  try  to	interpret
	      PostScript comments  in  weird  ways,  or	 on  some
	      PostScript printers.  Old versions of TranScript in
	      particular  cannot   handle   modern   Encapsulated
	      PostScript.

       -o name
	      The  output  will	 be  sent to file name If no file
	      name is given, the default name  is  file.ps  where
	      the  .dvi	 file was called file.dvi; if this option
	      isn't given, any default in the configuration  file
	      is  used.	  If  the first character of the supplied
	      output file name is an exclamation mark,	then  the
	      remainder	 will  be  used	 as an argument to popen;
	      thus, specifying !lpr as the output file will auto-
	      matically queue the file for printing.  This option
	      also disables the automatic reading of the  PRINTER
	      environment  variable,  and turns off the automatic
	      sending of control D if it was turned on	with  the
	      -F  option  or  in  the  configuration file; use -F
	      after this option if you want both.

       -O offset
	      Move the origin by a certain amount.  The offset is
	      a	 comma-separated  pair	of  dimensions,	 such  as
	      .1in,-.3cm (in the same syntax used in  the  paper-
	      size  special).	The origin of the page is shifted
	      from the default position (of one	 inch  down,  one
	      inch to the right from the upper left corner of the
	      paper) by this amount.

       -p num The first page printed will be the first	one  num-
	      bered  num.  Default is the first page in the docu-
	      ment.  If the num is prefixed by	an  equals  sign,
	      then  it	(and  any  argument  to the -l option) is
	      treated as a sequence number, rather than	 a  value
	      to  compare with \count0 values.	Thus, using -p =3

	      will start with the third page of the document,  no
	      matter what the pages are actually numbered.

       -pp pagelist
	      A	 comma-separated  list	of pages and ranges (a-b)
	      may be given, which will be interpreted as  \count0
	      values.	Pages  not specified will not be printed.
	      Multiple -pp options may be specified or all  pages
	      and  page	 ranges	 can  be  specified  with one -pp
	      option.

       -P printername
	      Sets up the output  for  the  appropriate	 printer.
	      This    is   implemented	 by   reading	in   con-
	      fig.printername , which can  then	 set  the  output
	      pipe (as in, !lpr -Pprintername as well as the font
	      paths and any other  config.ps  defaults	for  that
	      printer  only.   Note that config.ps is read before
	      config.printername In addition, another file called
	      ~/.dvipsrc  is  searched for immediately after con-
	      fig.ps; this file is intended  for  user	defaults.
	      If no -P command is given, the environment variable
	      PRINTER is checked.  If that variable exists, and a
	      corresponding  configuration file exists, that con-
	      figuration file is read in.

       -q     Run in quiet mode.  Don't chatter about pages  con-
	      verted, etc.; report nothing but errors to standard
	      error.

       -r     Stack pages in reverse  order.   Normally,  page	1
	      will be printed first.

       -s     Causes the entire global output to be enclosed in a
	      save/restore pair.  This causes the file to not  be
	      truly  conformant, and is thus not recommended, but
	      is useful if you are driving the	printer	 directly
	      and  don't  care	too much about the portability of
	      the output.

       -S num Set the maximum number of pages in each  `section'.
	      This  option  is	most  commonly	used  with the -i
	      option;  see  that  documentation	 above	for  more
	      information.

       -t papertype
	      This  sets the paper type to papertype.  The paper-
	      type should be defined in one of the  configuration
	      files,  along  with  the appropriate code to select
	      it.  (Currently known types include letter,  legal,
	      ledger,  a4,  a3,	 )  You can also specify -t land-
	      scape, which rotates a document by 90 degrees.   To
	      rotate a document whose size is not letter, you can
	      use the -t option twice, once for	 the  page  size,

	      and  once	 for landscape.	 The upper left corner of
	      each page in the .dvi file is placed one inch  from
	      the  left	 and  one inch from the top.  Use of this
	      option is highly	dependent  on  the  configuration
	      file.   Note  that  executing  the  letter or a4 or
	      other PostScript operators cause the document to be
	      nonconforming and can cause it not to print on cer-
	      tain printers, so the paper size should not execute
	      such an operator if at all possible.

       -T offset
	      Set the paper size to the given pair of dimensions.
	      This option takes its arguments in the  same  style
	      as  -O.  It overrides any paper size special in the
	      dvi file.

       -U     Disable a PostScript virtual  memory  saving  opti-
	      mization	that stores the character metric informa-
	      tion in the same string that is used to  store  the
	      bitmap  information.   This  is only necessary when
	      driving the Xerox 4045 PostScript interpreter.   It
	      is caused by a bug in that interpreter that results
	      in `garbage' on the bottom of each character.   Not
	      recommended unless you must drive this printer.

       -x num Set the magnification ratio to num /1000. Overrides
	      the magnification specified in the .dvi file.  Must
	      be between 10 and 100000.

       -X num Set  the	horizontal resolution in dots per inch to
	      num.

       -Y num Set the vertical resolution in  dots  per	 inch  to
	      num.

       -Z     Causes bitmapped fonts to be compressed before they
	      are downloaded, thereby reducing the  size  of  the
	      PostScript   font-downloading  information.   Espe-
	      cially useful at	high  resolutions  or  when  very
	      large  fonts  are	 used.	 Will  slow down printing
	      somewhat,	  especially   on    early    68000-based
	      PostScript printers.
