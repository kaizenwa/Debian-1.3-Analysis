NAME
       amslatex - structured text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
       amslatex [ first line ]

DESCRIPTION
       AmSLaTeX	 is an extension of LaTeX (see LaTeX - A Document
       Preparation System) that provides the powerful  mathemati-
       cal  typesetting	 macros	 of  AmSTeX  (see The Joy of TeX)
       within the syntax of LaTeX.  It should be contrasted  with
       LAmS-TeX	 (lamstex(1)),	which  extends AmSTeX with LaTeX-
       like features.

       AmSLaTeX documents can be processed by latex(1), so a sep-
       arate  executable  program  named  amslatex is not usually
       provided.

       AmSLaTeX is a TeX macro package, not a modification to the
       TeX  source  program, so all the capabilities described in
       tex(1) are present.

       The AmSLaTeX macros encourage writers to think  about  the
       content	of  their  documents,  rather than the form.  The
       ideal, not always realized, is to have no formatting  com-
       mands  (like  ``switch to italic'' or ``skip 2 picas'') in
       the document at all; instead, everything is done	 by  spe-
       cific  markup  instructions: ``emphasize'', ``start a sec-
       tion''.

       AmSTeX is the official typesetting system of the	 American
       Mathematical  Society,  and nearly all of its publications
       are typeset using AmSTeX.  The online version of AMS  Math
       Reviews uses AmSTeX input syntax for display of mathemati-
       cal material.  AMS authors can provide editors  with  com-
       puter-readable AmSTeX or AmSLaTeX files.

       AmSLaTeX will become deprecated in favor of LaTeX 2e, when
       the latter is released.

		     Documentation for AmSLaTeX, typesettable  by
		     LaTeX.   This supersedes The Joy of TeX, but
		     AmSLaTeX users may still find  that  book	a
		     convenient supplement.
