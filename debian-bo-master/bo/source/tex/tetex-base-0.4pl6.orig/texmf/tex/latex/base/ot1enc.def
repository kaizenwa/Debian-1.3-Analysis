%% IMPORTANT COPYRIGHT NOTICE:
%% 
%% You are NOT ALLOWED to distribute this file alone.
%% 
%% You are allowed to distribute this file under the condition that it
%% is distributed together with all the files listed in manifest.txt.
%% 
%% If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!
%%

%% Permission is granted to copy this file to another file with a
%% clearly different name and to customize the declarations in that
%% copy to serve the needs of your installation, provided that you
%% comply with the conditions in the file legal.txt.

%% However, NO PERMISSION is granted to generate or to distribute a
%% modified version of this file under its original name.

%% 
%% 
%% MODIFICATION ADVICE:
%% 
%% If you want to customize this file, it is best to make a copy of
%% the source file(s) from which it was produced.  Use a different
%% name for your copy(ies) and modify the copy(ies); this will ensure
%% that your modifications do not get overwritten when you install a
%% new release of the standard system.  You should also ensure that
%% your modified source file does not generate any modified file with
%% the same name as a standard file.
%% 
%% You can then easily distribute your modifications by distributing
%% the modified and renamed copy of the source file, taking care to
%% observe the conditions in legal.txt; this will ensure that other
%% users can safely use your modifications.
%% 
%% You will also need to produce your own, suitably named, .ins file to
%% control the generation of files from your source file; this file
%% should contain your own preambles for the files it generates, not
%% those in the standard .ins files.
%% 
%% The names of the source files used are shown above.
