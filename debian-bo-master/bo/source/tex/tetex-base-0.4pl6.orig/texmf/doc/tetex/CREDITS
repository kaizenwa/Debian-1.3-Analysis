Special thanks to:

Dirk Hillbrecht (dh@informatik.uni-hannover.de)
	for ideas, suggestions, beta-testing and writing documentation.

Karl Berry (kb@cs.umb.edu)
	for his web2c, dvips, xdvi and dvilj versions using the kpathsea
	library.  Without such good searching routines, the texmf-tree
	could not have been both: well organised and efficiantly
	searched.

Linus Torvalds:
	for Linux

Donald Ervin Knuth:
	for TeX
