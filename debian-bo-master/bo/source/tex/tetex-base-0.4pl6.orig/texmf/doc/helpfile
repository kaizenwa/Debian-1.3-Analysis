longtable.dvi
<li> Package <b>longtable</b> (cf. longtable.dvi) is useful for
typesetting multi-page tables with user defined table headers and
footlines. It can divide tables into "chunks", which will keep TeX
from running out of memory while processing large tables.

dinbrief.dvi dintab.dvi
<li> Package <b>dinbrief</b> (cf. dinbrief.dvi, and dintab.dvi for
just a table of commands) provides a LaTeX package for typesetting
letters conforming to DIN rules. As such it is of interest mainly to
German users. See the various .tex-files for examples.

floatflt.dvi floatexm.dvi floatfge.dvi floatexm.tex
Package <b>floatflt</b> (cf. floatflt.dvi) is used for having small
tables or figures (namely floats) typeset in the text area. The text
floats around the float in question, thus the name of the package.
floatexm.dvi (a compiled version of floatexm.tex) shows an example
document. floatfge.dvi contains information about the predecessor
floatfig package.

pfgguide.ps pfgguide.dvi
Package <b>psfrag</b> (cf. pfgguide.ps) is used together with the
program ps2frag to imbed LaTeX constructs into included postscript
graphics. You do this by either formatting texts in the postscript
figure in a special way recognized by ps2frag, or by telling LaTeX
which postscript texts of the figure to replace by which LaTeX
sequences. The user documentation is contained in pfgguide.ps, the
version in pfgguide.dvi will probably not view properly.

foiltex.dvi sampfoil.tex
Class <b>foiltex</b> (cf. foiltex.dvi) is used for typesetting foils
with somewhat more possibilities than the slides class, like several
different basic font sizes. You have to read foiltex.dvi for usage
documentation and restrictions. In particular, IBM allows only
personal, non-commercial, experimental use of this class, and all
derivative works have to be sent to IBM which automatically gets
licence rights for them. So better be careful! sampfoil.tex provides a
usage example.

grfguide.dvi grfguide.ps a.ps
Packages <b>graphics</b> and <b>graphicx</b> (cf. grfguide.ps) provide
the standard LaTeX interface to special printer driver features, like
graphics inclusion, stretching, rotation and colors. grfguide.ps is
the documentation prepared by dvips, the version grfguide.dvi is
likely to be missing some document features unless being processed by
dvips.

euler.dvi beton.dvi
<li> Package <b>euler</b> (cf. euler.dvi) is used for typesetting
LaTeX math in the Euler math fonts designed by Hermann Zapf and used
in the book `Concrete Mathematics' by Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. The
corresponding text fonts are selected by the beton package, described
in beton.dvi .

beton.dvi euler.dvi
<li> Package <b>beton</b> (cf. beton.dvi) selects the concrete
roman text fonts used in the book `Concrete Mathematics' by Graham,
Knuth, Patashnik. Use the euler package described in euler.dvi for the
corresponding math fonts.

float.dvi
<li> Package <b>float</b> (cf. float.dvi) provides a \newfloat
command for generation of environments similar to table and figure. It
also provides new float styles like boxed and ruled, as well as
mechanisms for defining their ilk.

germdoc.dvi
<li> Package <b>german</b> (cf. germdoc.dvi) which can also be used by
plain TeX provides typing shorthands for special German characters, as
well as shorthands for some special hyphenation constructs occuring
only in German. It also selects captions in German or a few other
languages.

fancyheadings.dvi
<li> Package <b>fancyheadings</b> (cf. fancyheadings.dvi)
provides easy customization of headers and footers of your page
layout.

typehtml.dvi
<li> Package <b>typehtml</b> (cf. typehtml.dvi) provides typesetting
of HTML documents. HTML2 and the expired draft HTML3 are currently
supported.

endfloat.dvi
<li> Package <b>endfloat</b> (cf. endfloat.dvi) will typeset all of
your floats at the end of an article in a separate section. Some
publishers require this for manuscripts.

supertabular.dvi
<li> Package <b>supertabular</b> (cf. supertabular.dvi) will typeset
tables spanning more than one page. It is similar to the longtable
package, but somewhat older. One major functional difference is that
it typesets tables with separate column widths on each page, so that
you could not "cut and paste" the several parts of a supertabular into
one large table.
