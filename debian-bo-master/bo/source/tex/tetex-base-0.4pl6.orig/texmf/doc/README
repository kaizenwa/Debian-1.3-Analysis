This directory contains the documentation for the tex system.

Some directory contain a Makefile that can be used to build
some extra PostScript documentation.

To make the documentation, simply type "make".

If you add new documentation, you can recreate the file

	helpindex.html

with the command

	./mkhtml > helpindex.html

The file helpindex.html can be viewed by any WWW browser, such as
Moasic, lynx, lemacs, xemacs (with w3 mode). It allows you to browse through
all *.dvi and *.ps files below this directory.
