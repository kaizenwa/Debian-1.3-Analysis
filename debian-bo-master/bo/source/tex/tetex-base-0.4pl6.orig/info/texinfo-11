Second Edition Features
***********************

  The second edition of the Texinfo manual describes more than 20 new
Texinfo mode commands and more than 50 previously undocumented Texinfo
@-commands.  This edition is more than twice the length of the first
edition.

  Here is a brief description of the new commands.

* Menu:

* New Texinfo Mode Commands::   The updating commands are especially useful.
* New Commands::                Many newly described @-commands.

New Texinfo Mode Commands
=========================

  Texinfo mode provides commands and features especially designed for
working with Texinfo files.  More than 20 new commands have been added,
including commands for automatically creating and updating both nodes
and menus.  This is a tedious task when done by hand.

  The keybindings are intended to be somewhat mnemonic.

Update all nodes and menus
--------------------------

  The `texinfo-master-menu' command is the primary command:

`C-c C-u m'
`M-x texinfo-master-menu'
     Create or update a master menu.  With `C-u' as a prefix argument,
     first create or update all nodes and regular menus.

Update Pointers
---------------

Create or update `Next', `Previous', and `Up' node pointers.

*Note Updating Nodes and Menus::.

`C-c C-u C-n'
`M-x texinfo-update-node'
     Update a node.

`C-c C-u C-e'
`M-x texinfo-every-node-update'
     Update every node in the buffer.

Update Menus
------------

Create or update menus.

*Note Updating Nodes and Menus::.

`C-c C-u C-m'
`M-x texinfo-make-menu'
     Make or update a menu.

`C-c C-u C-a'
`M-x texinfo-all-menus-update'
     Make or update all the menus in a buffer.  With `C-u' as a prefix
     argument, first update all the nodes.

Insert Title as Description
---------------------------

Insert a node's chapter or section title in the space for the
description in a menu entry line; position point so you can edit the
insert.  (This command works somewhat differently than the other
insertion commands, which insert only a predefined string.)

*Note Inserting Frequently Used Commands: Inserting.

`C-c C-c C-d'
     Insert title.

Format for Info
---------------

Provide keybindings both for the Info formatting commands that are
written in Emacs Lisp and for `makeinfo' that is written in C.

*Note Info Formatting::.

Use the Emacs lisp `texinfo-format...' commands:

`C-c C-e C-r'
     Format the region.

`C-c C-e C-b'
     Format the buffer.

Use `makeinfo':

`C-c C-m C-r'
     Format the region.

`C-c C-m C-b'
     Format the buffer.

`C-c C-m C-l'
     Recenter the `makeinfo' output buffer.

`C-c C-m C-k'
     Kill the `makeinfo' formatting job.

Typeset and Print
-----------------

Typeset and print Texinfo documents from within Emacs.

*Note Printing::.

`C-c C-t C-b'
     Run `texi2dvi' on the buffer.

`C-c C-t C-r'
     Run TeX on the region.

`C-c C-t C-i'
     Run `texindex'.

`C-c C-t C-p'
     Print the DVI file.

`C-c C-t C-q'
     Show the print queue.

`C-c C-t C-d'
     Delete a job from the print queue.

`C-c C-t C-k'
     Kill the current TeX formatting job.

`C-c C-t C-x'
     Quit a currently stopped TeX formatting job.

`C-c C-t C-l'
     Recenter the output buffer.

Other Updating Commands
-----------------------

The "other updating commands" do not have standard keybindings because
they are used less frequently.

*Note Other Updating Commands::.

`M-x texinfo-insert-node-lines'
     Insert missing `@node' lines using section titles as node names.

`M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update'
     Update a multi-file document.  With a numeric prefix, such as `C-u
     8', update  *every* pointer and menu in *all* the files and then
     insert a master menu.

`M-x texinfo-indent-menu-description'
     Indent descriptions in menus.

`M-x texinfo-sequential-node-update'
     Insert node pointers in strict sequence.
