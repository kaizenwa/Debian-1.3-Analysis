Installation procedure:
-----------------------

Login as root, copy the .tgz file to the /usr/src directory and cd to that
directory, then unpack the file: 

   cd /usr/src
   tar zxvf fvwm95-2.0.42a.tgz

A new fvwm95-2.0.42a directory will be created, cd to that directory, then
compile and install the package:

   cd fvwm95-2.0.42a
   ./configure
   make
   make install

Next, take the example.fvwm2rc95 config file, rename to .fvwm2rc95 and
copy it to your home directory. Check it to make sure that the ModulePath,
IconPath and PixmapPath options point to the correct directories.

After that, modify your .xinitrc or .xsession in order to start fvwm95-2. 
Remove or comment out the line executing your previous window manager
(usually the last line in the file), then add at the end a command like
the following: 

   exec fvwm95-2

Start the X session, hopefully, a cyan screen with a taskbar and button
bar will appear. You may have to modify further the .fvwm2rc95 file
according to your needs. If you are not very familiar with the standard
fvwm2, you can take a look at the man pages, the syntax of the config
commands is there explained.
