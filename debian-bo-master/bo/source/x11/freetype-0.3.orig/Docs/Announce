  The FreeType project aims the  development  of a free and portable
  quality TrueType  renderer,  available  with  source  code.   This
  package  is  known  as  AR3  (Alpha  Release  3)  and contains the
  current  library  and  two   test  programs  used  to  demonstrate
  performance (a simple glyph viewer, and a simple profiler).

  It is release for informative and demonstration purposes only. The
  authors provide it as is, with no warranty.

  1. What's in this release :

       Unfortunately, we could not release a beta. Some things have
       evolved more than expected, some others slower.  Anyway, you
       can now benefit from the following features that were not in
       the previous release AR2 :

          - grayscale support in DOS, OS/2 and X11

          - much, much better portability, configurability 
            and memory usage

          - the engine now loads all character mappings (in C)
            though there is no character to glyph index mapping
            fuction yet.

          - more bugfixes, of course .. ;)

       What is to come in the next release is :

          - full-featured TrueType interpreter.

          - multiple opened font instances.

          - new file and memory models for better performance and
            caching.

          - a first high-level interface.

          - and still more bugfixes..


Thanks for your time and consideration,

David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, Werner Lemberg,
and all the FreeType enthousiasts ...
