Development notes :
-------------------

Raster          The rasterizer is now secure, sub-banding, with grayscaling.

 TO DO :

   - Compute the max number of points/scanline to allocate just enough
     space for the two trace tables.. This can be done just before a
     call to Render_Glyph. Or replace the trace arrays by linked lists.

   - Add an horizontal line drawing in To_Line() when we encouter
     an horizontal segment with ( y % 64 == 0 ) with no drop_out
     control.

   - Add the additionnal horizontal decomposition/sweep to take
     care of horizontal drop-outs when drop-out control is on
     ( simple and complex ).

TTFile          Right now, it is a debugging component, that tries to
                load the whole file into a malloced block. This limits
                the current use of 'zoom' and 'testtime' to font files
                smaller than 64 K on 16 bit architectures. Not a very
                great change though..

TTTables        It seems that the contour information generated from
                the tables is a bit superfluous relative to their
                actual use. This may need a small clean up.

                Composite glyph are still unsupported, due to the
                persistance of the current Load_TrueType_Glyphs.

 TO DO :

   - Add various character mapping tables loading.
     Write a function to map from ASCII/Unicode to
     Glyph index.

   - Add the management of an additionnal 'Glyph cache' so that we
     don't have to decompress the whole 40 Ko of a typical glyph
     table just after a font file load.

TTIns           Very few changes from the last release. Is not ported
                to C yet.
