                    ----------------------------

    Copyright 1996 David Turner, Robert Wilhelm and Werner Lemberg

0. Throughout this license, the terms "FreeType project",  "FreeType
   engine", "FreeType library" and  "FreeType  archive" refer to the
   set of files  originally  distributed  by  the  authors  (  David
   Turner,  Robert  Wilhelm, and  Werner Lemberg ) as the "FreeType
   project", be they named as alpha, beta or final release.

   "You" refers to  the  licensee,  or  person  using  the  project,
   where "using" is a generic term including compiling the project's
   source code as  well  as  linking  it  to  form  a  "program"  or
   "executable".   This  program  is referred to as "a program using
   the FreeType engine".

   This license applies  to  all  files  distributed in the original
   FreeType  archive,  including  all  source  code,  binaries   and
   documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated  in  the  file  in  its
   original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
   If  you  are unsure wether or not a particular file is covered by
   this license, you must contact us to verify this.

1. THE FREETYPE ARCHIVE IS PROVIDED  "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
   WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY  AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT  WILL  ANY  OF  THE  AUTHORS  OR  COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS  BE  LIABLE  FOR  ANY  DAMAGES  CAUSED  BY THE USE OR THE
   INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

   As you have not  signed  this  license,  you  are not required to
   accept it.   However  as  the  FreeType  project  is  copyrighted
   material,  only  this  license  grants  you  the  right  to  use,
   distribute  and  modify it.  Therefore, by using, distributing or
   modifying the FreeType project,  yo  indicate that you understand
   and accept all the terms of this license.

2.  This release of the FreeType archive is placed under the Library
    GNU Public License (LGPL).  A copy of the LGPL should be found
    in the documentation directory under the name 'copying.doc'.

    However, in order to spread FreeType on as many platforms as
    possible, a different license exists for freeware and commercial
    developers who do not wish to use the LGPL-ed release of
    FreeType.  This license can be obtained by contacting the
    authors.  However, we do not encourage you to use FreeType in
    your products before its final release.
