1.0 - 1.0a: Include several patches provided by R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk
	    (Sorry, no RL-name known) for higher ANSI-compliance and
	    that are needed to allow compilation under HP-UX.
	    
	    Changed Imakefile to use double :: (Ooops.. Why did my make not
            complain?)

	    Added #include <unistd.h> in RgbText.c for all these funny SUN's
            outside. I have only limited access to SUN's. It compiles now clean
            on a Sun w/o any warnings. However, on the Sun I used, it crashes
            now somewhere internally in the Xlib. Hmm.. Well, you wanted a Sun
	    so you get one.. If anyone can send me a patch s.t. it runs on a
	    Sun.. I'll grateful accept it.

	    No new features! (See end of man-page!)
1.0a - 1.1: Change name from xpalette to xcolorsel.
	    Autodetect in source for X11 release.
	    font is in ascii_sink instead of text_sink for R6, changed in RgbSrc.c, RgbSink.c
	    Two makefile.generic's due to different linkage.
	    Support for read-only colormaps (TrueColor). Several patches in the RgbText-Widget.
	    NOINSTALLCOLORMAPS flag for AIX added.
1.1 - 1.1a: Fixed illegal initialization of asciirep in RgbText.c:init.
            Wrong number of arguments was given to XtCreateWidget in RgbText.c:init.
            Cured unimportant memory leak in RgbText.c:init
            Reversed names of generic makefile, to distinguish them on 13 char per filename
              only machines.
            Added debug makefile (for my own convenience)
            Several patches in RgbText.c that allow to handle files that do not contain
              any colors.
