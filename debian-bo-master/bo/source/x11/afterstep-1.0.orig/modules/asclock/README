     2. `configure`
     3. `make` (Send me the output if this fails)


HINTS
     -  If you are using 'Wharf', and only a part (48x48) of the clock is 
        visible, then
        you need AfterStep 0.98Beta Prerelease 4 and you have to set the 
        'MaxSwallow' keyword for 'asclock'.


TODO  (for version 1.1)
    - proper colorhandling for shaped clock. (too many colors used!)
    - inclusion of asclock into Wharf
    - language loading at run-time

FEEDBACK
    Please send me language customized 'month.xpm' and 'weekday.xpm' files.
    I prefer uuencoded mail.
