Do-It-Yourself Instructions:

Edit the Imakefile in this directory if needed.

execute the following commands

        MakeMakefiles

        make all

Monitor the output of the above commands for error messages.

execute the following commands to install the binaries and manpages

        make install
 
        make install.man

        cp ./icons/*.xpm /usr/include/X11/pixmaps

        mkdir /usr/lib/X11/afterstep/backgrounds

        ln -s /usr/lib/X11/afterstep/backgrounds /backgrounds
 
        cp ./backgrounds/* /backgrounds

If this gives you fits, manually copy the ./src/afterstep and 
./modules/Wharf/Wharf binaries to their proper places, usually 
/usr/bin/X11/afterstep and /usr/lib/X11/afterstep/Wharf
