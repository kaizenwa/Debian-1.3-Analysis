DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _X_p_o_s_t_i_t  provides  a  mechanism for manipulating on-screen
       Post-it(r) notes.  All six sizes of Post-it notes  may  be
       displayed,  edited, and saved to disk files.  In addition,
       any on-screen note may be resized to  any  arbitrary  size
       either when it is created or at a later time.

       All  notes can be "hidden" - the notes are still available
       but not shown on the screen until requested by  the  user.
       Hidden  notes  will stay hidden when xpostit is exited and
       then restarted (as long as the user saves all notes before
       exiting).

       When  _x_p_o_s_t_i_t  is first invoked, it creates a small window
       with a plaid background.  This is the control  window  for
       _x_p_o_s_t_i_t.   Additionally,  if  any notes were stored in the
       save directory (see below), these will be  placed  on  the
       screen  at  their  last locations, unless they were hidden
       when saved (see below).  Each Post-it note, when  created,
       makes another window on the screen.  _X_p_o_s_t_i_t is controlled
       using the mouse buttons and a menu.  The Post-it notes are
       controlled by using a drop down menu.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _X_p_o_s_t_i_t accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
       options along with the additional options listed below.


       --bbss _n_u_m_b_e_r
               Specifies the size  of  the  character  buffer  in
               which  to  save each Post-it note.  A note may not
               contain  more  than  this  number  of  characters,
               including newlines.  The default is 1024.


       --nnww _p_i_x_e_l_s
               Allows  the  user to specify the width, in pixels,
               for a single character of text.  This is dependent
               on  the font being used, but the Athena Widget set
               and the Xt Intrinsics apparently doesn't  allow  a
               program to determine this value at run time.  This
               value is used to determine the width of  the  Name
               dialog box, which is used to provide a title for a
               given note.  The default value for this option  is
               10 pixels.

XPOSTIT(1)                                             XPOSTIT(1)


       --aaoo _o_f_f_s_e_t
               The  offset  is specified in pixels and is used to
               determine the X and Y offsets from an anchor  note
               for  a  note being cascaded.  The default value is
               15 pixels.


       --ddiirr _p_a_t_h
               Specifies the path name of the directory in  which
               to store saved Post-it notes.  If _p_a_t_h begins with
               a `/' it is taken as-is; if it does not begin with
               a  `/',  the  path  is  taken relative to the home
               directory.   If  the  named  directory  does   not
               already exist, then _x_p_o_s_t_i_t attempts to create it.
               The default is _._p_o_s_t_i_t_n_o_t_e_s.


       --ttmmppddiirr _p_a_t_h
               Specifies the path name of the  directory  to  use
               for temporary files.  By default ``/tmp'' is used.


       --pprriinnttccmmdd _c_m_d
               This must be a quoted command string that  can  be
               used  as  the format string to sprintf().  It must
               include "%s" for the temporary file name used when
               printing   a   note.    The  buffer  created  with
               sprintf(), this option value,  and  the  temporary
               file  name is passed to the system() call to print
               the note.  By default, the printcmd value is ``lpr
               %s''.


       --ccaalleennddaarrccmmdd _c_m_d
               This is the command used to produce a calendar for
               the current month.  On most Unix systems this will
               be ``cal'', which is the default.  The output from
               this command is redirected to a temporary file and
               then  inserted  into  a note at the current cursor
               location.


       --eemmaaiillccmmdd _c_m_d
               The "Email" option from the notes menu will pop up
               a  window  prompting  for  an  email address.  The
               -emailcmd  command  line   option   or   .emailCmd
               resource  can  be  set to your systems mailer com-
               mand.  The mailer must accept the text of the mail
               via  standard  input (actually as a pipe from "cat
               tmpfile").  "cmd" must be a Unix style command  in
               printf()  format.   See the section on _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_i_n_g

       --ssbb     Enables scroll-bars.  If specified, a  scroll  bar
               will be attached to each Post-it note.


       --ssvv     Enables save-on-exit.  When specified, this option
               tells _x_p_o_s_t_i_t to save all Post-it  notes  to  disk
               files  when  exiting.  If not specified, notes can
               be saved to disk files manually by the user or via
               the  autosave  feature.   It  is useful to specify
               this option since hidden  notes  cannot  be  saved
               unless  either the "Save All Notes" option is used
               or the autosave option has not been disabled.  Its
               also  to  use this option since its not guaranteed
               that the autosave  feature  will  have  saved  all
               notes since their last updates when xpostit exits.


       --cc      Enables compatibility mode.  Initially this is for
               notes  created using the %! magic cookie.  In ver-
               sion 2.2 this was  changed  to  %%!!  because  the
               original   cookie  was  the  one  being  used  for
               Postscript files.  In the  future  this  mode  may
               cover  other items that are not compatible between
               versions/releases.


       --nnss     Disables the autosave feature.


       --nnaa     Disables alarms.


       --iinntteerrvvaall
               Sets the timeout interval (in  minutes)  for  when
               the  autosave  timeout  should  expire.  When this
               timer expires, all notes are  automatically  saved
               to disk.  The default value is 10 minutes.


       --hhoommeeddiirr _p_a_t_h
               Specifies  the  base directory from which the File
               Selection Window will look for files and  directo-
               ries.    If  not  specified,  and  the  associated
               resource _._h_o_m_e_D_i_r is not set then the  environment
               variable HHOOMMEE is used.  If this is not set either,
               then the File Selection Window uses the  root  (/)
               directory as its start point.


       --vveerrssiioonn
               Displays the current version of xpostit.


       --hheellpp   Displays a usage message.

WWIIDDGGEETT UUSSAAGGEE
       _X_p_o_s_t_i_t uses several widget types to construct the objects
       it uses.

       The control window is a  Plaid  widget  called  ``Plaid''.
       This  is a widget designed by David A. Curry, the original
       author of _x_p_o_s_t_i_t_.

       The menu is a pop-up shell called  ``Menu''  containing  a
       SimpleMenu  widget.   From this menu the hidden notes menu
       can be popped up.  The hidden notes menu is also a Simple-
       Menu widget.

       Each Post-it note is a pop-up shell called ``PostItNote'',
       containing a Form widget called ``Note'' which contains  a
       Text  widget  called ``NoteText'', and a MenuButton widget
       called "Options".  The Options button, when selected, pops
       up  a  drop-down  menu called "OptionsMenu" (see the Xpos-
       tit.ad application defaults file).  Inside  of  this  menu
       are   five   menu   items   called   ``Save'',  ``Erase'',
       ``Destroy'', ``Hide'', and ``Name''.

       The confirmation box is a pop-up shell called ``Confirm'',
       containing a Form widget called ``Buttons'' which contains
       two Command widgets  called  ``Confirm''  and  ``Cancel''.
       There  is also dialog box which pops up when the Name menu
       item is selected which is called "Dialog".

RREESSOOUURRCCEESS
       _X_p_o_s_t_i_t understands all of the  core  X  Toolkit  resource
       names and classes as well as those listed below, which are
       all of class XXppoossttiitt.


       ..bbuuffSSiizzee
               Specifies the size of the character buffer used to
               store a Post-it note.  The default is 1024.


       ..nnaammeeWWiiddtthh
               See  the  -nw  command  line  option.  The default

               _n_o_t_e_s.


       ..ttmmppDDiirr Specifies the path name of the  directory  to  use
               for temporary files.  By default ``/tmp'' is used.

       ..pprriinnttCCmmdd
               This must be a quoted command string that  can  be
               used  as  the format string to sprintf().  It must
               include "%s" for the temporary file name used when
               printing   a   note.    The  buffer  created  with
               sprintf(), this option value,  and  the  temporary
               file  name is passed to the system() call to print
               the note.  By default, the printcmd value is ``lpr
               %s''.


       ..ccaalleennddaarrCCmmdd
               This is the command used to produce a calendar for
               the current month.  On most Unix systems this will
               be ``cal'', which is the default.  The output from
               this command is redirected to a temporary file and

               location.


       ..eemmaaiillCCmmdd
               The "Email" option from the notes menu will pop up
               a  window  prompting  for  an  email address.  The
               -emailcmd  command  line   option   or   .emailCmd
               resource  can  be  set to your systems mailer com-

               via  standard  input (actually as a pipe from "cat
               tmpfile").  "cmd" must be a Unix style command  in
               printf()  format.   See the section on _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_i_n_g

               Controls the state  of  the  save-on-exit  option.
               The default is ffaallssee.


       ..ssccrroollllBBaarr
               Controls  placing  scroll  bars  on Post-it notes.

       ..ccoommppaattiibbiilliittyy
               Enables compatibility mode.  This shouldn't really
               be  set  in the app-defaults file.  If you wish to
               use this feature, use the -c option.


       ..iinntteerrvvaall
               Sets the timeout interval (in  minutes)  for  when
               the  autosave  timeout  should  expire.  When this

       It is possible to rebind the mouse buttons  in  the  Plaid
       widget to perform different functions by changing the wid-
       get's translations.  It  is  not  recommended  that  other
       actions (as specified in the application defaults file) be
       changed, however.  The _r_a_i_s_e_(_) action, normally  bound  to
       the  left  mouse  button,  raises  all notes.  The _l_o_w_e_r_(_)
       action, normally bound to the middle mouse button,  lowers
       all  notes.   The menu raising function, normally bound to
       the right  mouse  button,  is  performed  by  calling  the
       actions _X_a_w_P_o_s_i_t_i_o_n_S_i_m_p_l_e_M_e_n_u_(_M_e_n_u_) and _M_e_n_u_P_o_p_u_p_(_M_e_n_u_).

               names  of the notes so it is wise to give a note a
               meaningful name (using the Name  option  from  the

               Each note can be "anchored".  If one or more notes
               are  anchored  and  the "Cascade" option is chosen
               from the xpostit menu, then all the visible  notes
               are  cascaded onto the anchored notes.  An attempt
               is made to distribute  all  visible  notes  evenly
               amongst  all  the  anchored notes.  Each note also
               has an "unanchor" option as  well.   Only  one  of
               "anchor"  or "unanchor" is sensitive for any given
               note.  Hidden notes are not affected by  the  cas-
               cade  feature.   The  default  offset for cascaded
               notes (from the anchor) is 15 pixels.  This can be
               changed  with  the -ao option or the .anchorOffset
               resource.

               If you "lose" a note and want to bring  it  up  at
               the  cursor, select ``Find A Note'' from the plaid
               menu.  A pop up window of all notes will  be  pre-
               sented.   Select  the note you want and if its not
               hidden it will pop up at the  cursor.   If  it  is
               hidden  it  will  pop  up in the appropriate spot.
               The ``Cancel'' button will close the pop up if  no

       This menu pops up from the ``Hidden Notes'' option of  the
       plaid  menu.   It  functions  the  same  as the plaid menu
       except the menu does not disappear  until  either  a  menu
       option  is  selected or the label (at the top of the menu)
       is clicked on.

       Each Post-it note is made  up  of  three  parts  (plus  an
       optional scroll bar): a Title bar, a text window where the
       text of the note is stored, and a menu bar.

       The menu bar has two menus: _F_i_l_e and _N_o_t_e_s _.  The first of
       these  contains  options pertaining to file input and out-
       put, such as Open (for importing  a  file  to  the  note),
       Export  (for  saving  the  text  contents of the note to a

       file), Print and Email.

       The second menu contains items for manipulating the  note:
       Hiding,  Naming,  Erasing,  Adding a calendar or date/time
       stamp, etc.

       To enter text into a Post-it note, simply move  the  mouse
       cursor  into  the text window and start typing.  Since the
       text window is actually a Text widget, all the Text widget
       translations  are  accepted.   Essentially, this means you
       can use most of the EMACS  control  keys  in  the  window.
       Additionally,  the  various mouse buttons used for manipu-
       lating the selections and cut buffer are understood.

       After entering text in the Post-it note, you may  wish  to
       save  the  note  in a disk file.  This way, if the machine
       goes down, or if you exit _x_p_o_s_t_i_t, the Post-it note can be
       restored  when  you  restart  _x_p_o_s_t_i_t.  (Post-it notes are
       also saved automatically  (if  ssaavveeNNootteess  is  true)  if  a
       SIGHUP,  SIGINT,  SIGTERM, or SIGQUIT signal is received.)
       To save the note to a disk file, click on the Notes button
       and  drag  the  mouse  cursor  to  the  menu  item labeled
       ``Save'', then release the mouse button.  The note will be
       saved  as the file ``note_n'' in your save directory, where
       _n is some sequence number.  Note that  the  ``Save''  menu
       item will not allow you to save unless something have been
       typed in the Text of the note, the name of  the  note  has
       been  changed,  or  the  text of the note has been erased.
       This is a good way for checking if you've made changes  to
       the note.  If the Save menu item is "insensitive" (grayed-
       out) then you haven't made any changes to the Text of  the
       note.   NNOOTTEE: it is important to remember that if you have
       disabled the auto-save (sv)feature then the note will  not
       be  saved until you have pressed the ``Save'' button.  You
       can also make sure changed notes  get  saved  on  exit  by
       enabling the ave on Exit feature.

       To  erase  the entire contents of the text window, you can
       click on the Notes button and select  the  ``Erase''  menu
       item.  This will bring up a confirmation window, which has
       two buttons labeled ``Confirm'' and  ``Cancel''.   If  you
       press the ``Confirm'' button, the text will be erased.  If
       you press the ``Cancel'' button,  the  operation  is  can-
       celed, and nothing will happen.  NNOOTTEE: erasing the text in
       the window does not affect any contents of  the  note  you
       have  saved  on  disk unless you press the ``Save'' button
       again.

       To destroy a Post-it note, getting rid of  its  window  on
       the  screen and the disk file it is saved in, click on the
       Notes button and select the ``Destroy'' menu  item.   This
       will  bring  up  a confirmation window as described above.
       If you confirm the operation, the Post-it note will disap-
       pear  from  the  screen  and the disk file it was saved in

       will be deleted.


       To rename a note, you can click on the  Notes  button  and
       select  the ``Name'' menu item.  This will bring up a dia-
       log box, which has two  buttons  labeled  ``Confirm''  and
       ``Cancel''  as  well  as a field to enter text for the new
       name.  If you press the ``Confirm'' button, the  new  name
       will be placed in the title bar of the note.  If you press
       the ``Cancel'' button, the operation is canceled.

       To hide a note, you can click  on  the  Notes  button  and
       select  the  ``Hide'' menu item.  This will cause the note
       to disappear from the screen.  To  bring  the  note  back,
       select  the  ``Hidden  Notes'' option from the plaid pull-
       down menu.  Then select the note you wish  to  bring  back
       up.   NNOOTTEE:  The hidden notes will not stay hidden between
       _x_p_o_s_t_i_t sessions unless you first  select  the  "Save  All
       Notes"  option  from  the plaid menu or options to save on
       exit (see discussion above) have been set.

       To anchor a note you can click on  the  Notes  button  and
       select  the ``Anchor'' menu item.  This will mark the note
       as an anchor note.  Anchor notes are the bottom note,  the
       "anchor", when the Cascade option is chosen from the xpos-
       tit plaid menu.

       To unanchor a note you can click on the Notes  button  and
       select  the  ``UnAnchor'' menu item.  This will remove the
       note from the list of anchor notes.

       Note that only  one  of  the  ``Anchor''  or  ``UnAnchor''
       options  will  be  sensitive (allow user selection) at any
       time.  They are mutually exclusive options within any give
       note.

       To  print  a note, you must have configured xpostit with a
       valid print command (via the -printcmd command line option
       or  the  .printCmd resource).  Select the ``Print'' option
       from the Notes pull down menu.  The text of  the  note  is
       printed.

       To  email  a  note  use the ``Email'' option.  This option
       will pop up a window prompting for an email address.  Fill
       in  the  text field and select ``Accept'' to send the mes-
       sage.  The notes title will be used as the  subject  line.
       Select ``Cancel'' to cancel sending the message.

       To  set a notes alarm, select ``Set Alarm'' from the notes
       Notes pull down menu.  A window pops up with  month,  day,
       hour and minute fields.  Set each of these for the day and
       time you wish the alarm to go off.  If you  wish  to  save
       this  value  between invokations you should use either the
       notes ``Save'' option or the  ``Save  All  Notes''  option

       from the plaid windows menu.  When a notes alarm is set an
       icon of a clock will be visible next to the  Options  menu
       button in the notes menu bar.

       To turn off the a notes alarm, select ``Unset Alarm'' from
       the Notes pull down menu.  This will disable the alarm for
       that note and remove the clock icon from the menu bar.

       To insert a copy of the current calendar month in the text
       select the "Insert Calendar" option from the  notes  menu.
       The  text will be inserted at the current cursor location,
       so you should be sure to position the cursor  first.   You
       can  position the cursor by just clicking in the text win-
       dow of the note.

       Adding the  date  and  time  is  done  using  the  "Insert
       Date..." option from the notes menu.  A dialog box provid-
       ing a variety of formats is presented.  Select the  format
       desired  by  clicking  on the small box to the left of the
       format string and then click on "Accept".  The text string
       will  be inserted at the current cursor location.  Be sure
       to position the cursor prior to using the option.

       To import a text file at the current cursor location in  a
       note,  use  the File menu's Open option.  A File Selection
       Window opens.  Choose a file and select  ``Accept''.   See
       the section on the FFiillee SSeelleeccttiioonn WWiinnddooww for more details.

       Exporting the text to a file is similar to opening a  file
       for  import.   Choose the Export option from the File pull
       down menu.  Select a file from the File Selection  Window.
       Again,  see  the  section  on the ile Selection Window for
       more details on how to use that window.

       In order to use your systems mailer with the Email feature
       of  xpostit,  you need to configure the appropriate mailer
       command using either the -emailcmd command line option  or
       the  .emailCmd resource.   The format for both of these is
       the same:  a double-quoted string which contains the  name
       of  the  mailer command, the option for providing the sub-
       ject line, and the addressee.  By default the Unix command
       "mail"  is  used.  It is defined in the Xpostit.ad (and in
       the source code fallback resources) as:


                 "mail -s\"%s\" %s"


       The format is the standard format used by  printf().   The
       first  string  parameter  is the subject line.   The back-
       slashes are required so that the following  double  quotes
       are  passed  properly to the shell.  If these are left out

       the subject will be truncated to the  first  word  of  the
       first  string parameter and an attempt will be made by the
       mailer to send mail to non-existant recipients.

       The second string is the  addressee.   The  order  of  the
       string  parameters  is  required (subject first, addressee
       second).  The mailer command accpets the text of the  mail
       via standard input.  This too is required.

       If you use elm, you might want to change this to:


                 "elm -s\"%s\" %s > /dev/null"


       The  difference here is that elm prints out a few messages
       when it runs in batch mode and you should  send  those  to
       /dev/null.

       The File Selection Window contains two scrollable windows,
       a text input field, and two buttons.  The scrollable  win-
       dows  contain  the  directories  (the left-side scrollable
       window) and the files (the right-side  scrollable  window)
       in  the  current  directory.  These windows may not be the
       same size if the number  of  directories  or  files  isn't
       enough to stretch the window to its maximum size before it
       allows scrolling (ie don't report the windows  being  dif-
       ferent  sizes  as  a bug - its a feature).  You can scroll
       the windows the same way you scroll the text of the notes.

       The  buttons  inside the scrollable windows only require a
       single click to activate them.  Clicking  on  a  directory
       button  will close the File Selection Window and reopen it
       using the new directory as its base.  The scrollable  win-
       dows  will be updated to reflect the files and directories
       in that directory and the text input field will be updated
       to show the current directory.

       Clicking  on  a button in the files scrollable window will
       cause that file to be selected.  If you are opening a file
       then  the file chosen will be added to the current note at
       the location of the cursor in that note.  Be sure  to  set
       the cursor to where you want to import text before opening
       a file.  If you are exporting a file then the text of  the
       file  will  be  written to the file chosen.  It is assumed
       that since you manually selected a  file  known  to  exist
       that  you want to overwrite that file, so be sure you know
       what you're doing before you click on a file  for  export-
       ing!

       The text input field can be used to manually type a direc-
       tory or file name.  If the name typed is a directory,  the

       File Selection Window is closed and a new one opened using
       the new directory as the base.  If the  name  typed  is  a
       file  then  that  filename  is  used for the current task,
       either opening or exporting.  If exporting, and  the  file
       exists,  a  window is popped up asking for confirmation to
       overwrite that file.  Click on ``Accept'' to proceed  with
       the export or ``Cancel'' to skip it.

       The  two  buttons  in  the  File  Selection window are the
       ``Accept'' and  ``Cancel''  buttons.   The  Cancel  button
       closes  the  File Selection Window with no further actions
       taken.  The Accept button only has meaning in relation  to
       the  text input field.  If you click on Accept, then what-
       ever is in the text input field is used  as  the  filename
       for  the current task (open or export) and the appropriate
       action is taken.

       The sizes of the Post-it notes are only as accurate as the
       display  dimension  and resolution returned by the server.
       On the Sun server and possibly  others,  this  means  they
       aren't all that accurate.

       On  Linux systems the word wrap feature of the Text Widget
       appears broken.  The words get wrapped to  the  next  line
       but  they  do  not get erased from the previous line.  I'm
       not sure how to fix this.  You can resize the  note  using
       the  window  manager  to  clear the problem, or scroll the
       note window.

       The message: ``Warning: XtRemoveGrab  asked  to  remove  a
       widget not on the list'' may be written to stdout after an
       alarm popup is dismissed.  This is a timing issue in the X
       libs, I think, and doesn't appear to cause any problems.

       The Dialog used to name a note doesn't limit the number of
       characters that can be used in a name,  although  it  does
       prevent  (by  use  of  translations) a user from putting a
       newline in the text.  The drawback  to  not  limiting  the
       length  of  the  name  is that the dialog box's text field
       won't resize or scroll to  the  right  as  characters  are
       typed  off the right hand edge of the field.  Bummer dude.
       This might be fixable if key events force a resize on each
       keystroke.  Hmmm.  I'll have to think about that one.

       The  -c  option has been reported to not read in old notes
       properly.  It eats the first line.   This  can  be  worked
       around  by adding a blank line to the old notes.  However,
       I couldn't reproduce this problem.  I suggest  creating  a
       backup  of your old notes before trying to run with the -c

       option, just in case.

       Hidden notes have their shell x and y coordinates set to 1
       less  than  the  note  originally had them set to when the
       program starts.  I think this is either a problem with the
       way  fvwm  was  placing  the  notes when they were visible
       (with window manager borders) or  a  problem  with  the  X
       libs.   Probably  fvwm.   In anycase, over time, the notes
       will slowly move toward the upper  left,  but  only  while
       invisible.   When you pop them up, things are fine.  Basi-
       cally, its not something worth fixing.

       On some systems (all?), specifically Solaris, setting  the
       num-lock on prevents the pull-down menus from allowing the
       user to select menu options.  The fix:  turn off  numlock.

       The  File  Selection Window is not graceful, but its func-
       tional.  I could have used the FWF  FileSelection  widget,
       but  that required including the complete FWF kit, which I
       didn't want to have to do.  Besides, I think I may  switch
       this  to  GTK  (the  GIMP Toolkit widget set) for the next
       release.  Maybe.

       Without a color display for canary yellow  notes  and  red
       plaid,  the  aesthetic  value  of  _x_p_o_s_t_i_t cannot be fully
       appreciated.
