GWMSH-1.0

This program is a simple interface to gwm. To use it you should apply
my patch to gwm-1.7o (enclosed in the distribution) that gives you
with-output-to-string gwm built-in function. Gwmsh uses this function
to retrieve from gwm results of any type in printed form.

NOTE: no need to apply this patch in 1.8 or later, as it is included

I found this program useful for quick examination of gwm variables
or test runs of newly defined functions. Use it if you like it. Any
comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Enjoy.
