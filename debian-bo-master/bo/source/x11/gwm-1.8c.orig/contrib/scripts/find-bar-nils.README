find-bar-nils is a KLONE script to detect all uses of the construct 
(bar-make ()) that changed semantics between gwm 1.7p_beta_2 and gwm
1.7p_beta_3 (more generally between 1.x and 1.8)

These constructs should be replaced by (bar-make)

KLONE is a free scripting language that can be found by ftp at
