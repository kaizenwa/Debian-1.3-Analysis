These are the files lex.yy.c y.tab.c as generated by lex and yacc on a sun.
This will be of use to port GWM to systems without lex or yacc, since the GWM
parsers are incompatible with flex and bison... Most notably linux!

I used them to port wool on the amiga, for instance.

Just copy lex.yy.c y.tab.c into the GWM sources and it should compile OK.
