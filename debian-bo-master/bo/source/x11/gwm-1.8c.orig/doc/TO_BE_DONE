				GWM PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS:
				#########################

None are planned anymore for this version (1.8) which should stay a stable
base for everyday use, as the C layer is quite stable and now powerful enough
for most developments in Wool code.

Enhancements will go into the new version k-wm in some future date.
