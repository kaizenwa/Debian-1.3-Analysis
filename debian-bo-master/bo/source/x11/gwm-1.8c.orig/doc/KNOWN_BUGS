				GWM KNOWN BUGS:
				###############

This is the list of bugs that we are aware of in the current release.
And that wont be fixed by me, since 1.8 is a final release now.

############### BUGS

*** gwm doesnt work on alphas !!! compile it on a mips decstation and
translate it via MX instead
NOTE: this doesnt seem to be true anymore. The -taso comiple flags seems to
enable gwm compilation natively on alphas

gwm does not use motion events, resulting in some cases of polling the server
(active waiting), especially while placing interactively new windows with a 
frame

"exit" to a tag outside of a file being loaded do impredictable
results. Errors are well trapped, though.

XV: xv (the image displayer) does a lot of weird guesswork to find what is its
window decoration, and for GWM, guess wrongly. The current bug is that if you
have a decoration for xv window with neither a top nor a left bar, and start
xv with a -geometry other than 0,0, if you move it upwards or to the left, at
the  next image displayed it will reset its window to the starting position.
This is not fixable via gwm. Cure: dont specify a geometry and place it via
gwm code

gwm may run out of X IDs as allocated by the Xlib for windows and pixmaps, as
it doesnt try to re-use old ones instead of 

############### LACK OF FEATURES

Many built-in functions still do not check the type of their arguments,
causing possible bus errors when handled the wrong type of arguments.
We try to catch some bus errors, though...

The standard profile is not "polished" yet -- all contributions are welcome,
especially for the standard profile, a rooms system and a mwm-like window frame

The debugging functions are very crude. Not true debugger, only prints.

Wool is still lacking a lot of features, I/O notably.
