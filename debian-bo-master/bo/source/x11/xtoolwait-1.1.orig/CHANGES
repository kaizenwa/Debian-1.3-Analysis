Jan 12 1997: xtoolwait 1.1 released

	* Updated the documentation: use the -mappings option once to
	  detect the virtual desktop.
	* Removed the xtoolplaces patch since it has been integrated
	  in the official xtoolplaces distribution available at
	  http://mammoth.lle.rochester.edu/~adam/Progs/programs.html

Oct 15 1996: xtoolwait 1.0 released

	* Updated the documentation: window manager must be started
	  first.
	* Adapted the xtoolplaces patch to the latest release (1.4a).
	* Bumped up version number. Believed to be rock stable.

Dec  1 1995: xtoolwait 0.3 released

	* xtoolwait demanded that the window manager had completed its
	  initialisation, which is often not true. Fixed.

Nov 30 1995: xtoolwait 0.2 released

	* xtoolwait now compiles under SunOS 4.1.x too :-)
	* xtoolwait failed to detect window mappings under tvtwm. Fixed.

	* Window mappings generated by other X clients are ignored.
	* Fixed a possible file descriptor leak.
	  Reported by Malte Uhl <malte@Mathematik.Uni-Bielefeld.DE>.
