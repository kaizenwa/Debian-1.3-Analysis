 What's On Desk
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When you start TkDesk for the first time, it comes up with it's default
 window layout.  This comprises:

   o the Application Bar (or appbar for short) -- that's the vertical
     row of buttons on the left hand side of the screen,
     
   o a File Browser Window (or browser) containing three file listboxes.
     This is the "main" window of TkDesk used for file operations like
     copy, move etc.

 There's also a smaller variant of the browser window: the File List
 Window.  This is a compact version of the browser with just one file
 listbox.



 The Application Bar
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each button provides a pop-up menu that can be accessed by pressing the
 right mouse button over any of the appbar's buttons.  Clicking the first
 mouse button on an appbar button invokes the first entry of the pop-up
 menu.  The appbar can be moved around by pressing the Meta- or Alt-key
 and the first mouse-button at the same time over the appbar.

 Summary of mouse bindings (MB: mouse button):
 
   MB-1:  Invokes first entry of associated pop-up menu.
   MB-3:  Displays associated pop-up menu.
   Meta/Alt-MB-1:  Move the application bar around.

 The first button gives access to some key functions of TkDesk, and to
 all the history lists managed by TkDesk.  It also contains an entry to
 change the layout of the appbar to horizontal, if that's what you prefer.

 Now just explore this and the other buttons!

 

 The File Brower Window
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The main part of the file browser windows are the file listboxes.
 They are laid out such that the left listbox always displays the contents
 of the parent directory of a file listbox.  As you traverse a directory
 tree, listboxes "move off" the visible area to the left.  The large
 horizontal scrollbar on top of the listboxes can be used to make them
 visible again.

 Summary of mouse bindings (MB: mouse button):

   MB-1:		Select directory or file.
   Shift-MB-1:		Single-select directory or file.
   Drag-MB-1:		Select an area.
   Shift-Double-MB-1:	Select all items.
   Double-MB-1:		Open directory or file (actually invokes the
			first entry of the associated pop-up menu).
   Ctrl-Double-MB-1:	Directory: Open file list window with this directory.
			File: Open file interactively.
   MB-2:		Drag directory or file.  Can be dropped on
		        other file listboxes, some appbar buttons,
			or the desktop (root window).
   MB-3:		Display associated pop-up menu.

 The button right above each file listbox displaying the name of the
 directory whose contents is displayed in the listbox is a menu button.
 Pressing the first mouse button over it displays a menu of operations
 applicable on the contents of the listbox.
 

 
 The File List Window
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 File list windows can be opened by opening a directory while pressing
 the Control key, or by entries from the browser's "Directory" menu.
 It's main difference to the browser window is that the contents of
 directories you open are always displayed in the same file listbox.

 For the list of mouse bindings refer to the previous section.



 Get going!
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This should be enough to get you started with TkDesk.  Note that there
 is a "Help" menu button in the menu bar of the file browser window.
 It gives access to the TkDesk User's Guide, which documents every tiny
 feature of TkDesk (not yet though).  Also note that TkDesk has a
 "balloon help" feature: just place the mouse pointer over any button
 of the application bar or button bar in the browser window.

 And now it's your turn:  Start exploring TkDesk!  Look into every
 menu, click on every button, and take a look at the User's Guide!
 
 When you've become a bit more familiar with TkDesk you should take
 a look at TkDesk's configuration files (Menu "TkDesk/Configuration").
 Virtually every aspect of TkDesk can be configured!  Just experiment
 with the default configuration.


 
 Enjoy TkDesk!!
