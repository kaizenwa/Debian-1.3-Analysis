   Installation of TkDesk 1.0b4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. TkDesk 1.0b4 requires either Tcl/Tk 7.4/4.0, 7.5/4.1, or 7.6/4.2.
   Older versions will not work!  And newer ones will probably not work
   either, as so far there have been incompatible changes at least at
   the C level in every new release of Tcl/Tk.
   
   If you're not sure if you have the right version of Tcl/Tk installed,
   or if you have Tcl/Tk installed at all, try to
   
   a) execute wish4.0, wish4.1, or wish4.2. If your shell finds this
      command, you have the right version installed.  Go to point 2 below.
   b) execute wish. If this command succeeds, type "set tk_version" at
      wish's command prompt. Press return. You should see "4.0" or greater.
      
   If you don't have Tcl/Tk, or not the right version, you have to get
   Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2 and install these independently from TkDesk.
   Current versions of Tcl/Tk are available from
      
      ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl
      ftp://mirror.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/mirror/ftp.smli.com
      ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/tcl-archive/ftp.smli.com
      ftp://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/unix/tcl/alcatel/ftp.smli.com
      
   and lots of other mirror sites. Don't forget to also get and apply 
   any patch files for the current version. These can be found in the
   same directory. Instructions for patching, compiling and installing
   are included in the respective packages.
      
   LINUX USERS: There are precompiled versions of Tcl/Tk available from
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/lang/tcl amd all its mirrors.
   Even shared libraries for a.out and ELF systems are included.
   If you're running Slackware 3.0 you might have Tcl/Tk already installed,
   try executing wish. Else you can find it on Slackware's tcl disk.
      
2. Once you have installed Tcl/Tk, you have to edit a few things in the
   Makefile. This step might at some time be superseded by a GNU autoconf
   script. (Any volunteers for creating one?)

   The Makefile contains lots of comments, so it should be pretty clear
   what you have to edit where.
   
3. Configure and compile everything by typing 

   % make

   If you are asked for any paths during the configuration step,
   interrupt by pressing Control-C and make sure that the paths you
   entered in the Makefile are correct, e.g. that they actually
   contain the Tcl/Tk libraries etc.  Then just execute "make" again.

   If you get an error message saying that "ranlib" could not be found:
   This error is ignored by make, and you can safely do the same. Some
   systems require archives to be ranlib'ed, others don't.

   If you get error messages like "undefined symbol: dlopen" etc.,
   you have to add -ldl to the OTHERLIBS setting in TkDesk's Makefile,
   at least on Linux systems.  Take a look at the comment lines in the
   Makefile for settings suitable for your system.

   RedHat users:
   There is a missing symbolic link that you have to create yourself
   to link TkDesk.  This is the procedure suggested by David Scott:

   	 1. Make sure you have /lib/libdl.so.1
   	 2. Run /sbin/ldconfig
   	 3. cd /lib
   	 4. ln -s libdl.so.1 libdl.so
   	 5. Try compiling again (I think it worked for me!)

   IMPORTANT: You *have to* use the BLT excerpt that comes with TkDesk.
   External libraries will not work! That is because versions older then
   BLT 2.1 don't work either with Tk 4.0 or Tk 4.1, and stock BLT 2.1
   contains a serious bug that keeps bgexec from working. And if your
   concerned about your disk space: The BLT part of TkDesk is only about
   50 kB compiled, so that really shouldn't hurt.
   
   If you'd like to have a look at TkDesk when make is finished but
   before installing it, do the following:
   1) Comment out the 5th line in the file tkdesk, that's the one
      beginning with "set tkdesk(library)"
   2) Start tkdesk with the command
      % ./tkdesksh tkdesk -configdir ./tcldesk/configs

4. Install TkDesk by typing

   % make install

   If you're upgrading from an earlier version of TkDesk, you're
   ~/.tkdesk directory will not be overwritten. In fact, a ~/.tkdesk
   directory is now only created when TkDesk is run for the first time
   and only if this directory does not exist yet. But have a look at
   the CHANGES file and the default configuration files (in the
   configs subdirectory of TkDesk's library directory, typically
   /usr/local/lib/TkDesk) for new configuration variables.


And that's it! You now should be able to start TkDesk from the command
line by typing "tkdesk".  The principal rule then is to click on
everything with all your mouse buttons (not simultaneously, though :-)).

Since 1.0b4 there is a short "Quick Start Guide" available that's
automatically displayed when TkDesk is run for the first time.
It's also available from the browser window's "Help" menu.
Please read it, it's *really* short!

The TkDesk User's Guide is available both as PostScript in the "doc"
subdirectory (of the directory created when you untar'ed the TkDesk
package), as well as online via the help button of the application bar
or the "Help" menu.

I hope you enjoy TkDesk! If you have any suggestions for the further 
development of TkDesk, or in the unlikely event of finding a bug, or fancy
helping with the further development of TkDesk, please send me an email to 
Christian.Bolik@Mainz.netsurf.de. I'd also appreciate it if you just told
me what you think about TkDesk in general.

Have fun! Christian
