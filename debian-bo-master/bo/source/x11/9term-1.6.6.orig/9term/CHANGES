9term 1.2.1 beta

9term 1.2 beta
==============

(Changes due to Chris Siebenmann)

o	9term.c:
		- add a TERMCAP to the environment, for BSD-oid systems
		  without a 9term termcap entry. Swiped from the 'dumb' entry.
		- call snarfswap with the right arguments
o	9term.h:
		- new routine: gttymodes().
		- new way of handling system-dependant stuff; now we define
		  some #define's for POSIX tty handling and BSD pty handling,
		  since more machines besides Suns do that (POSIXPTYS and BSDPTYS).
o	command.c:
		- get the initial tty modes with gttymodes().
		- properly detach and reattach to controlling terminals
		  on Ultrix.
		- set the new tty to mode 0600, instead of whatever it
		  happened to have; the user can open it up later.
		- if we have job control signals, mimic login and set
		  them to SIG_IGN for non-job-control-aware shells.
o	pty.c:
		- Big changes here. We move from statically initializing
		  the ttmode structure to doing it in gttymode(), either
		  from the existing tty modes or with a set of default
		  values. The modes are forced to have a couple of sane
		  values, like echo on, and NL->CR NL mapping turned off
		  (since 9term ignores CRs). We compensate for DEC keyboards
		  with no backspace keys if DECKBD is turned on.
		  We handle Ultrix eccentricities. We make things conditional
		  on system-independant #defines in general if possible.
		  We're a little less forceful about using the Plan 9
		  set of control characters in DECKBD mode.

	The DECKBD option should not be depended upon at present.

9term 1.1.1 beta
================

o	caught more signals

9term 1.1 beta
==============

o	support for UTF output
o	BSD style ttys should work okay now (Arnold Robbins)
o	pending output flushed when interrupt sent (Bob Flandrena)
	(although this is a nice feature it is disabled at present due to
	the effect it has on throughput - to enable it #define SLOWASADOG)
o	forward/backward searching via button 3 menu (Bob Flandrena)
o	interaction with terminal modes reworked (Bob Flandrena)
