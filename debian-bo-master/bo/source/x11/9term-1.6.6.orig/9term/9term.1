.SH DESCRIPTION
.I 9term
is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.
It provides a terminal window similar to an 8\(12 window.
.SS Commands
The
.I 9term
command starts a new instance of a terminal window.
.PP
The
.B \-s
option creates a scrolling window;
by default scrolling is inhibited.
A
.B +s
option forces the window not to scroll.
.PP
The
.B \-unix
option starts
.I 9term
in
.B Unix
mode; normally it starts in
.B "Plan 9"
mode (see below).
The
.B \-9
option starts
.I 9term
in
.B "Plan 9"
mode.
.PP
The
.I fontfile
argument to the
.B \-p9font
option names a fontfile used to display text, both in
.IR 9term 's
menus and on the window.
It also
establishes the
environment variable
.BR font
with this value,
so any programs running in its windows may use the same font.
If
.I fontfile
cannot be used as a valid libXg font file (see
.IR font (4)),
then
.I 9term
will attempt to use an X font by the same name.
If
.B \-p9font
is not given,
.I 9term
imports a default font from the underlying graphics
server. If that fails
.I 9term
will attempt to use the default X font, see
.IR graphics (3).
.PP
The
.B \-ls
option make the window a login window (prepends a `\-' to
.IR cmd ).
The option
.B +ls
attempt to do the opposite.
The default is not to create a login window.
.PP
The
.B \-ut
option causes
.I 9term
to place an entry in the
.L /etc/utmp
file.
A corresponding
.B +ut
option prevents
.I 9term
from placing an entry in
.LR /etc/utmp .
The default is not to create a utmp entry.
.PP
The
.B \-label
command gives the new
.I 9term
window the initial label of
.IR label .
The default label is
.IR 9term .
.PP
The
.B \-e
option tells
.I 9term
to run the command
.I cmd
in the window with the following arguments.
This must be the final option on the command line.
If no command is specified,
.I 9term
runs the program specified by the environment variable
.B SHELL
in the window, if this is unset, then
.I 9term
runs
.IR sh (1)
in the window.
.PP
The
.B \-high
and
.B \-low
options set the maximum and minimum amount of characters kept by
.IR 9term .
At any one time the actual number of characters stored may slightly
exceed the highwater mark.
.PP
The
.B \-9wm
option allows
.I 9term
to work more harmoniously with
.I 9wm
when started before the window manager may have completed
its initialisation, such as in a user's
.L .xsession
file.  It causes
.I 9term
to refrain from placing a border around the text content of the window
and instead allows the window manager this task.
.PP
The
.I label
command changes a window's identifying name.
.PP
The
.I wloc
command prints the coordinates of the instance of
.I 9term
in which
it is executed and is used to construct a geometry argument for
X programs.  It relies on the environment variable
.B WINDOWID
which
.I 9term
places in the environment in a manner similar to
.IR xterm (1).
.SS Window control
Each window behaves as a separate terminal with at least one process
associated with it.
When a window is created, a new process (usually a shell; see
.IR sh (1),
.IR rc (1),
and
.IR es (1))
is established and bound to the window as a process group leader of a
new process group.
Initially, each window acts as a simple terminal that displays character text;
the standard input and output of its processes
are attached to
.LR /dev/tty .
.PD
.SS Text windows
Characters typed on the keyboard or written to
.L /dev/tty
collect in the window to form
a long, continuous document.
.PP
There is always some
.I selected text,
a contiguous string marked on the screen by reversing its colour.
If the selected text is a null string, it is indicated by a hairline cursor
between two characters.
The selected text
may be edited by mousing and typing.
Text is selected by pointing and clicking button 1
to make a null-string selection, or by pointing,
then sweeping with button 1 depressed.
Text may also be selected by double-clicking:
just inside a matched delimiter-pair
with one of
.B {[(<`'"\(d<
on the left and
.B }])>`'"\(d>
on the right, it selects all text within
the pair; at the beginning
or end of a line, it selects the line; within or at the edge of an alphanumeric word,
it selects the word.
.PP
Characters typed on the keyboard replace the selected text;
if this text is not empty, it is placed in a
.I snarf buffer
common to all windows but distinct from that of
.IR sam (1).
.SS The Output Point
Programs access the text in the window at a single point
maintained automatically by
.IR 9term .
The
.I output point
is the location in the text where the next character written by
a program to
.L /dev/tty
will appear; afterwards, the output point is the null string
beyond the new character.
The output point is also the location in the text of the next character
that will be read (directly from the text in the window,
not from an intervening buffer)
by a program from
.LR /dev/tty .
When such a read will occur is, however, mostly under control of
.I 9term
and the user.
.PP
In general there is text in the window after the output point,
usually placed there by typing but occasionally by the editing
operations described below.
A pending read of
.L /dev/tty
will block until the text after the output point contains
a newline, whereupon the read may
acquire the text, up to and including the newline, since
.I 9term
will not send characters until there is a newline after the output point.
After the read, as described above, the output point will be at
the beginning of the next line of text.
In normal circumstances, therefore, typed text is delivered
to programs a line at a time.
Changes made by typing or editing before the text is read will
be seen by the program reading it.
Lines are sent when a newline is typed by the user,
thus there may only be at most a single line of text after the output point
waiting to be sent.
.PP
Even when there are newlines in the output text,
.I 9term
will not honour reads if the window is in
.I hold mode,
which is indicated by a white cursor and border.
The ESC character toggles hold mode.
Some programs, such as
.IR mail (1),
may benefit from hold mode to simplify the editing of multi-line text;
type ESC when done to allow
.I mail
to read the text.
Hold mode is disabled when the terminal is in cbreak/raw mode, for example,
when using rlogin.
When the terminal is in this mode, changes to the last line will not
be `seen' by the program running in the window since characters typed
are sent immediately.
.SS Terminal modes
An EOT character (control-D) behaves exactly like newline except
that it is not delivered to a program when read.
Thus on an empty line an EOT serves to deliver an end-of-file indication:
the read will return zero characters.
Like newlines, unread EOTs may be successfully edited out of the text.
The BS character (control-H) erases the character before the selected text.
The ETB character (control-W) erases any nonalphanumeric characters, then
the alphanumeric word just before the selected text.
`Alphanumeric' here means non-blanks and non-punctuation.
The NAK character (control-U) erases the text after the output point,
and not yet read by a program, but not more than one line.
All these characters are typed on the keyboard and hence replace
the selected text; for example, typing a BS with a word selected
places the word in the snarf buffer, removes it from the screen,
and erases the character before the word.
.PP
The characters listed above are the default characters for the
.B "Plan 9"
mode of
.IR 9term .
The initial value of this set may be changed with the
.L p9TtyModes
X resource and may be useful for keyboards which have no backspace key
(such as DEC keyboards).
Such a change is static for the life of a
.IR 9term .
A corresponding resource,
.LR ttyModes ,
may be used to set the initial
.B Unix
mode characters.
Such characters may be altered over the life of a
.IR 9term .
.PP
Text may be moved vertically within the window.
A scroll bar on the left of the window shows in its clear portion what fragment of the
total output text is visible on the screen, and in its gray part what
is above or below view;
it measures characters, not lines.
Mousing inside the scroll bar moves text:
clicking button 1 with the mouse pointing inside the scroll bar
brings the line at the top of the
window to the cursor's vertical location;
button 3 takes the line at the cursor to the top of the window;
button 2, treating the scroll bar as a ruler, jumps to the indicated portion
of the stored text.
Also, a VIEW key (possibly with a different label; see
.IR keyboard (4))
scrolls forward
half a window.
A REVIEW key (scroll back half a window) may also be supported.
.PP
The DEL character sends an
.L interrupt
signal to all processes in the window's process group.
Alone among characters, the DEL and VIEW
keys do not snarf the selected text.
.PP
Normally written output to a window
.I does not
block when the text reaches the end of the screen.
In this respect
.I 9term
differs from an
.IR 8\(12
window.
A button 2 menu item toggles scrolling.
.SS Cutting, Pasting and Snarfing Text
Other editing operations are selected from a menu on button 2.
The
.B cut
operation deletes the selected text
from the screen and puts it in the snarf buffer;
.B snarf
copies the selected text to the buffer without deleting it;
.B paste
replaces the selected text with the contents of the buffer;
and
.B send
copies the snarf buffer to just after the output point, adding a final newline
if missing.
.B Mark/extend
is useful for making a selection larger than will fit on the screen.
.B Mark
indicates one extreme of the selection while
.B extend
selects the text from the current mark to the include the current selection.
.B Paste
will sometimes and
.B send
will always place text after the output point; the text so placed
will behave exactly as described above.  Therefore when pasting
text containing newlines after the output point, it may be prudent
to turn on hold mode first.
.B Scroll/noscroll
toggles scroll mode.
.PP
Button 3 menu items are used to search forwards and backwards
in the window, and access the hold and view features of
.I 9term
when running in Unix mode.
Selecting
.B fwd
.RB ( bkwd )
searches forward (backward) in the window from the current
cursor position for the next (previous) occurrence of the currently
selected text.
If no text is currently selected then
.I 9term
searches the window for the string currently in the snarf buffer.
Selecting
.B suspend
is equivalent to typing the hold key.  When the
terminal is in hold mode this menu item will change to
.BR resume .
Selecting
.B view
or
.B review
is equivalent to pressing the VIEW or REVIEW key.
The last button 3 menu item toggles between Plan 9 and Unix modes.
.SH "X DEFAULTS"

as well as
.TP 8
.B "scroll (\fPclass\fB Scroll)"
Specifies whether or not the window should scroll.
The default is ``false.''
.TP 8
.B "login (\fPclass\fB Login)"
Specifies whether or not the shell to be run in the
window should be started as a login shell.
The default is ``false.''
.TP 8
.B "utmp (\fPclass\fB Utmp)"
Specifies whether or not
.I 9term
should try to record
the user's terminal in
