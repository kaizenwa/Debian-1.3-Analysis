This library (libtext) provides an abstraction over frames for variable
length text objects.  It is equally at home under libXg or libg under
Plan 9.

When compiling with 9term and the sam distribution ensure that the
9term Makefile can find text.h.  This may be achieved most easily by
copying text.h from this directory to the include directory in the
libXg toplevel directory.

Some of the source in libtext is based on code Copyright Â© 1992 AT&T -
