dxpc Change Log

3.5.0 (February 27, 1997)

Changed checking of version numbers so that it prints out both numbers
(local and remote) to aid in resolving version problems.

Added ability to fork and run as a daemon process (-f cmdline option).
(Thanks to Brian Williams (epabcw@epa.ericsson.se) for the idea.

Added ability to have the client initiate the connection to the server.

Also, -k cmdline option will search for a daemonized dxpc and send it
SIGTERM.

Many documentation fixes related to changes implemented in 3.3.1 (an
unreleased version, whose changes didn't make it into the docs for 3.4.0).

3.4.0 (November 14, 1996)

New maintainer: Zachary Vonler (lightborn@mail.utexas.edu)

dxpc now has a home page:
  http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~zvonler/dxpc/

Implemented exchange of version numbers when connection between client and
server is first established so that in the future people won't have
problems trying to run incompatible versions.

Server and client switched cmdline args, so that the client needs no
parameters, and the server needs the hostname of the remote machine.

No change history is available for versions prior to 3.4.0.
