BUILDING DXPC
=============

To build dxpc, you need:
   1. the dxpc source (always check the contrib/utilities directory
      on ftp.x.org for the latest version)
   2. the X11R4, X11R5, or X11R6 include files
   3. a C++ compiler for each of the machines/operating systems on which
      you want to run the Client and/or Server Proxy.

Once you have these things, here's how to compile and install dxpc:

   1. Generate a Makefile

      There are two ways to generate a Makefile:

      a. If you have a working Imake setup, just run xmkmf to
         generate a Makefile from the Imakefile supplied with the
         dxpc source.  (Thanks to Larry Schwimmer
         <rosebud@cyclone.Stanford.EDU> for contributing the
         Imakefile.)

      b. If your system isn't set up to support Imake, you can use
         dxpc's interactive configure script to generate a Makefile.
         To do this, go to the dxpc source directory and run:
            sh ./configure

         This is a GNU autoconf configure script, so it likely will
         work on your system.  If it doesn't, please send the maintainer
         an email, including any error messages.

   2. Compile dxpc

      Just run:
         make


   3. Install dxpc

      Once you have compiled dxpc, you can install the dxpc executable
      and its manual page into the locations specified in your Imake
      configuration (if you used xmkmf) or in your inputs to the configure
      script (if you used "sh ./configure")
      by running:
         make install
         make install.man

      (Since there is only one executables to install, you could
      also just copy it to your chosen bin directory manually, if
      you prefer.)
