	* main.c:
	Some of the start-up code was re-written to fix the bug wherein the
	last file of a multi-file series was not displayed.

	Basically I create an array of strings 'msgs' (a subset of all the
	files passed to xmotd) of only the files to be displayed (all the
	files are in the array if -always is passed). And 'numsg' is the
	number of files in this array. In this way, nextMessage() will always
	know exactly how many files are to be displayed.

	* xmotd.c:
	nextMessage() was re-written to fix the bug wherein the last file of
	a multi-file series was not displayed.

	* main.c: Initial revision

	* textmode.c:
	If a file is not found, continue with the next file, rather than
	exiting.

	Update the time-stamp only if messages have been displayed (new var
	displayed counts the number of displayed messages).

	Exit, when all is said & done (runInTextMode() would return to
	xmotd.c).
