Copyright of changes to ISO 8859-2:

  This is a package of Lucida Sans Typewriter fonts, reencoded to iso 8859-2
  encoding. The original fonts (in 8859-1) were taken from X Consortium
  distribution of X11r6 and reencoded using a couple of GNU awk scripts and a
  bit of manual editing.  Author of this hack is Jan "Yenya" Kasprzak, to be
  reached at kas@muni.cz.
  Copying and usage conditions of the changed fonts are the same as for
  original fonts.
