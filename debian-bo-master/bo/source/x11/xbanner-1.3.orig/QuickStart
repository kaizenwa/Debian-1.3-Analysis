Hi!

Please read the docs if you want detailed information. Here's the
QuickStart Guide:

1.  gcc -O -o xbanner effect.c xbanner.c xres.c backg.c pix.c
              colors.c linger.c util.c plasma.c ripples.c 
	      -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXpm -lX11
    gcc -O -o freetemp freetemp.c util.c -lX11
    gcc -O -o random_effect random_effect.c	(optional)
    gcc -O -o xb_check xb_check.c		(optional)
2.  mv xbanner freetemp /usr/local/bin/X11	(optional)
3.  Copy the sample XBanner.ad (in the samples/
    directory) and edit it to suit your taste
4.  Place XBanner.ad in the app-defaults dir.
    And rename it from XBanner.ad to XBanner.
    (usually /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults).	(optional)
5.  Edit /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0 and add a
    line to run xbanner. You can use -display
    and -file <other-resource-file>.
6.  Edit /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession and add a
    line to run freetemp around the top.
7.  Logout to see what it does. (Assuming you
    have XDM set up and running already).

If any of the above mentioned files/directories don't exist for you, then
please refer to the documentation for detailed information on where they
can be and how to find them.

Also, the docs contain a lot of other usefule information.

P.S. If you are using XBanner, please send me a note, just so I'll know
     about the people using it. If you like it, it would be nice if you
     could show this by sending me a postcard to:
