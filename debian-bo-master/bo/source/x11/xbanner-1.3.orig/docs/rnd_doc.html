<H1>The Random Effects Utility</H1>

<HR>
<H3>What it is</H3>

The random_effect program is really a gross hack. It was inspired by an idea
donated by Thilo Wunderlich &lt;c15o@zfn.uni-bremen.de&gt; who asked for such a
feature. The program takes 1 commandline argument - a file name.

<H3>Format of <CODE>random_effect</CODE> config file</H3>

<PRE>
Line #1 = commandline to run xbanner (absolute path)
</PRE>
The rest of the lines are simply pathnames of XBanner resource files.
<P>
After reading the file, the program will select an effect file by random,
and execute the needed things.

<H3>Notes</H3>

If you need to put a "-display" to xbanner, then your first line in the
random-effect database file will look like:

<PRE>
   /usr/local/bin/X11/xbanner -display ggf:0
</PRE>
Again, thanks to Thilo Wunderlich &lt;c15o@zfn.uni-bremen.de&gt; for pushing me in
this direction. This is a neat addition to XBanner.
