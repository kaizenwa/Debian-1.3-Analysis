Hello!

This is an attempt to document who did what in XBanner. This is one of my
ways to say thanks! This is not in any particular order.

-------------

Oren Tirosh <orenti@hiker.org.il>
  Too much to count. The StandOut algorithm, which brought with it StandIn,
  StandOut2, StandIn2, PopArt, Coin, FunnyOutline and more. The Ripples BG
  was also Oren's idea. Lots more help with minor things.

Frank Wuebbeling <wuebbel@ESCHER.UNI-MUENSTER.DE>
  Frank's request was to support the XDM Chooser, which runs the Xsetup
  script, but does not keep an open link to the display, which causes
  XBanner's drawing to erase after the script is done. This is standard
  behaviour for a X11 server!

  Frank's request was given a solution in the form of the 'Linger' feature.
  Once this feature was done and working, the 'Glint' and Color-Cycling
  features were inevitable.

Chris Yeo <yeo@duke.usask.ca> & Ben Spade <bspade@asic.qntm.com>
  Proofreading the documentation

Rubinstein Dmitry <dimrub@nsof.co.il>
  Suggested that I tar the distribution not as 'root' - a good idea for
  people who wish to first untar in normal user accounts.

Zachary Sigma Vonler <zvonler@jove.acs.unt.edu>
  Reported that AcceleratedX by Xinside does not work!

Rich McClellan <richmc@seneca.fullerton.edu>
  A whole lot of help with setting up the web-page, as well as getting me
  the space on their server. I really owe Rich a lot.

Thilo Wunderlich <c15o@zfn.uni-bremen.de>
  Suggested the idea of then 'random_effect' utility.

Marc Welz <mwelz@cs.uct.ac.za>
  Pushed me to rewrite the error-handling code. Much better now.

Christopher Everett <ceverett@cyberramp.net>
  Reported the bug with empty strings. This made me look at XBanner in a
  whole new light! Now XBanner is not only to put text on the screen.
  XBanner can also be used if you only want a nice background.

Kyle Ferrio <kylef@engin.umich.edu>
  Tipped me to add reference to the 'xfontsel' utility into the font-tips
  help file.

Prof. Dasharath Singh <hsdsingh@hss.iitb.ernet.in>
  Suggested that I include a copy of my Xsession and Xsetup_0 files in the
  documentation.

Eric Darchis <Eric.Darchis@ping.be>
  Reported the anomalies with xdm-photo.

Dejan Vucinic <dejan@mit1.fnal.gov>
  Success report with SGI IRIX 5.3

Landon Boyd <landon@ccn.cs.dal.ca>
  Asked for multiple-pixmaps through a pixmap list file. A request to
  which I complied gladly.

Uwe Khatchikian <khatchik@buche.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>
  Sent me the sh / bash version of the Demo script, to be used by people
  who have not installed csh / tcsh on their system.

Have I forgotten you? I sincerely apologize. Please email me and I will add
you immediately.
