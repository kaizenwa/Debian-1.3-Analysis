Hi!

Just_an_Idea:
	As the name says... I am not sure it is better than others,
	just an idea I had, and liked it.
Evgeny_Stambulchik:
	Evgeny's idea is wonderful. Every FG color you would give it will
	give is a different touch. I like it very much. I tried a FG
	of DarkGreen, Yellow, Black, and others.
FgGrad_Idea_2:
	This one is the same as the FgGrad demo, but I chose different
	colors to contrast differently.
FatText_Sky:
	This is just an idea. Like a sky thingy.
My_Home_Setup.tar:
	This file contains my current setup at home. Try it. I think it
	is really beautiful.
