Future ideas:
1. Backgound with Fireworks, perhaps animated dripping letters
2. Load a .GIF file as pixmap to paste, and as background tile.
3. Add {red|green|blue}_direction and {red|green|blue}_speed options
   So one can ask to cycle only one component of the colors, or to
   cycle one component faster than another. I have manually tested
   this and it looks great. This will also enable people to do the
   color-cycling in jumps of 2 colors at a time or more, to speed up.
4. How to do separate cycle-speeds, so one could control the speed of
   color-cycling of each cycling component individually.
5. dir_count and dir_steps will one day let you have your color-cycling
   component switch direction of cycle every dir_steps changes.
6. Separate code into a library of effects.
7. Reflection style text. Oren Tirosh and I are working on this one.
   Israel Levin has also volunteered to help.
