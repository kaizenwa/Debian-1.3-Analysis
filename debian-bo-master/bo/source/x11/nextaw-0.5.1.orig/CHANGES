Changes since version 0.5:
- Text widget bug that manifested in chimera fixed.

Changes since version 0.3:
- Fixed the text widget bug in ScEd
- Added a DrawArrows resource to scrollbars
- Added checkbox and radiobutton styles to toggles
- Removed the lines that separated menu entries, because they were not 
looking the way I wanted. You can bring them back by removing
the -DNO_MENU_LINES define in Imakefile and recompiling.
- Added scrolling for menus that don't fit in the screen, like the
one in xfontsel. The code is not very pretty, but hey! We're the only
Athena flavor, AFAIK, that can do it!! :-)
- Added indicators for menuButtons
