The files in this directory with suffixes `.t', `.d', `.r', `.rr' and
`.err' are used for testing ed.  To run the tests, set the ED variable in
the Makefile for the path name of the program to be tested (e.g., /bin/ed),
and type `make'.  The tests do not exhaustively verify POSIX compliance
nor do they verify correct 8-bit or long line support.

The test file suffixes have the following meanings:
.t    Template - a list of ed commands from which an ed script is
      constructed
.d    Data - read by an ed script
.r    Result - the expected output after processing data via an ed
      script.
.rr   Result from a piped ed script.
.err  Error - invalid ed commands that should generate an error

The output of the tests is written to the files piped.ck, err.ck and
scripts.ck.  At the end of the tests, these files are grep'ed for error
messages, which look like:

	*** The script u.ed exited abnormally ***
or:
	*** Output u.o of script u.ed is incorrect ***

The POSIX requirement that an address range not be used where at most
a single address is expected has been relaxed in this version of ed.
Therefore, the  following script templates are disabled:
=-err.t.posix
a1-err.posix
i1-err.posix
k1-err.posix
r1-err.posix

To use these, remove the .posix suffix and run the tests as described
above.
