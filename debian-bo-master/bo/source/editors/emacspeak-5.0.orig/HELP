                            ======================
emacspeak: an interactive compiled Lisp function.
(emacspeak)

Starts the Emacspeak speech subsystem.  Use emacs as you normally would,
emacspeak will provide you spoken feedback as you work.  Emacspeak also
provides commands for having parts of the current buffer, the mode-line etc to
be spoken.

If you are hearing this description as a result of pressing
C-h C-e you may want to press C-e s to stop
speech, and then use the arrow keys to move around in the Help buffer
  to   read the rest of this description, which
includes a summary of all emacspeak keybindings.

All emacspeak commands use C-e as a prefix key.  You
can also set the state of the Dectalk by using
C-e d as a prefix.  Here is a summary of all
emacspeak commands along with their bindings.  You need to precede the
keystrokes listed below with C-e.

Emacspeak also provides a fluent speech extension to the emacs
 terminal emulator (eterm).
Note: You need to use the eterm package that comes with emacs-19.29.
