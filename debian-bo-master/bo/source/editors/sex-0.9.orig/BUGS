Some bugs in SeX, and things to do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

things to do for 1.0

	search regex syntax (what is it, use extended or not?)
	
	& in replace, maybe \(re\) and \1
	
	undo, redo
	
	change log should join adjacent typed characters
	
	have a testing period of two months (no new features, bugs fixed);
	release two months after last bug fix

---

things to do after 1.0

	forget ~/.sexrc; make everything configurable via X resources

	make smaller (rss) and faster

	anchors are shared over windows (should be in editwin's buf_info)

	missing: move(pair), extend(pair), select(pair)

	tab handling in sbuf is still a mess (hardcoded 8)

	press1+move outside window -> extend + scroll

	saving to directory without write permission: overwrite
	directly instead, after asking user

	check mtime before saving: save mtime when loading file,
	check before saving, if it is newer, check if files
	differ, and if so, ask if it should be overwritten
	
	write selection to file: ask if append/overwrite if
	file already exists
	
	popups: get focus (initially)
	
	color should be configurable
	 
	cursor should be configurable
	
	empty selection should be shown as bar or caret
	
	mark stack
	
	better file selectors (and other dialogs, and buffer menu)
