README for SeX
by Lars Wirzenius


This is the README for the Simple editor for X (SeX for short).
For an overview of the program, read doc/sex.html and sex.1.

Installation:

	0. Make sure you have installed Publib first.

	1. Unpack sources. This creates directory sex-<version>,
	   where <version> is the version number. Go into that
	   directory.
	
		gunzip -dc sex-<version>.orig.tar | tar xf -
		cd sex-<version>
		
	2. Run configure and make:
	
		./configure
		make
		
	   If configure can't find Publib, use the --with-publib,
	   --with-pubincdir, and --with-publibdir options. You can
	   also set the environment variables CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
	   
	   If you don't like the compilation options configure
	   picks, set CFLAGS before you run it.
	   
	   You probably need GNU Make.
		
	3. Install the files:

		make install

configure can relocate files fairly easily. See the --prefix option.

Use "./configure --help" for help.
