  * New upstream version: code has been reorganized and optimized a bit,
    bindings cleaned up a bit, some bugs fixed (see below).
  * Fixes bug #5893: loading file when unnamed buffer is current causes core

  * Fixes bug #5900: dumped core when clicking with middle button (jump) on 
    scrollbar and file was empty. Fixed size of horizontal scrollbar as well.
  * debian/rules: Added -g to compilation options (though not to linking).
  * debian/rules: No longer create empty etc.
  * debian/rules: Install /usr/doc/sex/.dwww-index.
  * debian/rules: Unpack .html.gz.
  * Added postinst and postrm that run dwww-doc-index, if it exists.
