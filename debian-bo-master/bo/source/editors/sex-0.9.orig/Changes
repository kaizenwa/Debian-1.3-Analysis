This is the change log for the Simple editor for X, by Lars Wirzenius.
Note that since SeX depends on Publib, and expecially its sbuf module,
this log is not complete. It should include all user visible changes,
though.

Changes for version 0.9 (released Sat Jan 11 05:33:46 EET 1997):

	* Fixed error messages when saving file with no name.
	* Fixed Debian bug #6443: trying to format selection when
	  it was empty and there was nothing in the killring.
	* Added note about horizontal scrollbar to manual page.

Changes for version 0.8 (released Sat Dec 28 01:18:09 EET 1996):

	* Combined anchor_forward and anchor_backward into 
	  anchor_move_delta. Saved 48 bytes of code and 16 bytes
	  of data. :-)
	* Moved some functions from editwin to win. Now only win
	  uses editwin, and win has fewer functions that are just
	  sugar coating over corresponding editwin functions.
	* Fixed key bindings for ctrl-backspace/delete.
	* Reduced unnecessary redrawing.
	* Selection reset to non-columnar after most operations.
	* "make install" installs documentation as well.
	* Fixed typing at columnar selection: now insert typed character.
	* Implemented cmd_yank_columnar and cmd_yank_previous_columnar.
	* Added command summary to manual.
	* Cleaned up some key and mouse bindings.
	* Fixed Debian bug #5893: loading file when unnamed buffer is
	  current causes core dump. (Problem was not checking that
	  name was non-NULL.)
	* Fixed Debian bug #5900: dumped core when clicking with middle 
	  button (jump) on scrollbar and file was empty. Fixed size of
	  horizontal scrollbar as well.
	* Fixed resize problem with vertical scroll bar.
	* Changed Shift-space to Ctrl-space (cf. Ctrl-Tab).
	* Columns can't be made invisible: startcol must be < endcol.
	* Added ad2c and made sure the binary works without the
	  application defaults file (SeX). This increases size of
	  binary by several kilobytes, but it's worth it.
	* Fixed problem with ctrl-k ctrl-k ctrl-y not returning the
	  whole deletion.
	* Fixed problem when formatting paragraph and someone else
	  owned the selection.
	* Fixed intermittent problem when closing windows.
	* Fixed indenting/undenting a line when selection is empty and
	  at beginning of line.

Changes for version 0.7 (released Thu Dec  5 11:50:34 EET 1996):

	* Fixed configure problem (couldn't find Publib easily).
	* Publib: sbuf_load now doesn't set dirty flag when loading
	  non-existing file.
	* error.c: Fixed buffer overrun problem if error message was
	  too long.
	* error.c: Reduced size reserved for error messages (can't make
	  it dynamic).
	* filewin.c: Made list of filewins dynamic.
	* actions.c: Combined many action functions into a few to reduce
	  code size (got rid of more than 10 kB!)
	* sex-file.c: Added error reporting to cmd_save_file.
	* Fixed indent/undent selection: don't indent line after selection.
	* Added tilde support to save-as, insert-file, write-to.
	* Added indent/undent by one char. Changed tab to indent_width
	  configuration variable.
	* Focus can again be selected with the mouse in search window.
	* Fixed move(eoln) when selection ends in newline.
	* Added columnar blocks. They sort of work.
	* Print control chars directly, not as dot.
	* Fix display of partial chars at edge of window.
	* Added more extend(xxx) actions.
	* Modified key bindings a little bit.

Changes for version 0.6 (Wed Nov  6 19:56:23 EET 1996):

	* Added this change log.
	* Wrote a proper README.
	* Changed shift-PageUp/Down to extend selection by page.
	  (Old bindings was scroll without changing selection. Those
	  actions are still available, but not bound to anything.)
	* Added -g to compilation and linking options in debian/rules.
	  Circumvented debstd's automatic stripping. This is needed to
	  get useful core dumps.
	* Centralized tab handling to its own module. It should now
	  be possible to change tab width.
	* Fixed display of line and column numbers so that the first
	  column is 1, not 0.
	* Publib: rewritten sbuf_write_to_file fixes bug that often
	  crashed the program when saving.
	* Released version 0.6.

This change log starts at 0.5.
