nude pictures of teenage girls performing sexual or erotic
acts, presumably committing incest or being raped. This page
contains no sex, no bondage & discipline, no sado-masochism,

how to find prostitutes here. Sorry.

<p>You might find interesting things to do with ice cream, though, if
that's your kind of thing.

<h1>Simple editor for X (SeX)</h1>

<h2>SeX?</h2>

<p>SeX is the Simple editor for X. See the <a
href="sex-manual.html/index.html">manual</a> for more
information.

<h2>The SeX files</h2>

<p>I use the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux system</a>,
so I provide pre-packaged binaries for Debian. For other systems you will
need to download the source and compile it yourself.

<dl>

<dt><a href="sex_0.9.orig.tar.gz">Original sources</a>
<dt><a href="sex_0.9-1.diff.gz">Diffs for Debian</a>
<dt><a href="sex_0.9-1.dsc">Debian source description file</a>
<dt><a href="sex_0.9-1_i386.changes">Debian .changes file</a>
<dt><a href="sex_0.9-1_i386.deb">Debian .deb file</a>

</dl>

<p>To compile SeX, you need my <a href="../programs/">Publib library</a>
as well. Install it first.

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<p>The sources include a file called <em>BUGS</em>, which contains
a list of known bugs and misfeatures. There are lots of small ones.
I don't know of any big ones.

<p>SeX looks pretty disgusting, at least with the standard Athena
widgets (Xaw). I use the Windows95-looking Xaw95 package myself.
It's a replacement for Xaw, and makes SeX look much nicer. See
the screenshot below for an example.
