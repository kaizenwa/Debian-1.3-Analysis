     This  is  the  file  README  for  the   xwpe   distribution, 
     version 1.4.0.

     xwpe is a X-window programming environment designed  to  use
     on UNIX-systems. It is similar to 'Borland C++ or Turbo Pas-
     cal' environment. The  difference  between  the  programming
     environments from Borland an xwpe is that many compilers and
     linkers  may  be  started.  From  a  menu  three   different
     debuggers  can be chosen. And of course not only key strokes
     can select these options you can also use a mouse.

     Errors that occur while compiling and  linking  a  programme
     can  be examined in the sources: The cursor will jump to the
     corresponding line in the source-file. Programmes using more
     than  one  source-file  can  be  managed  with the so called
     project-option (see also project-file).  The  programme  can
     be  started  from  within  the  Programming-Environment  and
     errors   may   be    found    using    a    debugger.    The 
     debugging-environment  allows  the  user  to set  and  unset 
     breakpoints directly in the source  code.  The  contents  of  
     variables  may  be  displayed  in  a  special  window,   the 
     Watch-Window.  This  window  is  updated  while  reaching  a  
     breakpoint.  The  Stack-Window displays the programme stack.

     Help is available for xwpe and the  man-pages  installed  on
     the system may be displayed. All this can be reached via the
     help-functions.

     The editor may be used to edit up to 35 files  at  the  same
     time.   They  are  all displayed in a window of their own. A
     mouse is used to select special editor function from the top
     menu.  These  function  can  also  be  selected by hitting a 
     special key or combinations of keys. Some of these  features
     are a  complete  search  and  replace  function (yes, it can 
     search for regular  expressions)  and  a  file-manager.  The
     file-manager  is  used  to  open,  copy,  rename and move or
     delete files.

     The X-window programming environment can be used without the
     special  programming  features.  If  it  is invoked as `xwe'
     (`we' if used with a character terminal) it can be used as a
     editor e.g. for shell-programming.
