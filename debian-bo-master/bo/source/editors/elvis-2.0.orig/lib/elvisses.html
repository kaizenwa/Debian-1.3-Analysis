</head><body>

<h1>10. SESSIONS, INITIALIZATION, AND RECOVERY</h1>

This section of the manual describes the life-cycle of an edit session.
We begin with the definition of an <a href="#SESSION">edit session</a>
and what that means to elvis.
This is followed by sections discussing <a href="#INIT">initialization</a>
and <a href="#RECOVER">recovery after a crash.</a>

<h2>10.1 Sessions</h2><a name="SESSION"></a>

Elvis is eventually expected to meet the COSE standards,
which require (among other things) that programs be able to save their
state so that they can be restarted later.
It isn't required to restart in <em>exactly</em> the same state,
but it should come as close as possible.

<p>For elvis, this means that edit sessions should be restartable.
It is possible to begin an edit session with one elvis process,
exit that process, and then later start a new elvis process which
resumes the previous edit session.

<p>To accomplish this, elvis stores its state in a file, called the session
file.
For all practical purposes, the session file <strong>is</strong> the session.

<p>The name of the session file is stored in the <a href="elvisopt.html#session">session</a> option.
By default, this will be a file in your home directory, named "elvis*.ses",
where "*" represents a number chosen at run-time to make the file name unique.
You can specify some other name for the session file via the
<strong>-s</strong><var>session</var> command-line flag.

<p>If the session file doesn't already exist when elvis starts running,
then elvis will create it.

<p>When elvis exits, it will normally delete the session file if this
is the elvis process that created it.
If the session file was left over from some other elvis process, then
elvis will not delete it upon exiting.
This is controlled by the <a href="elvisopt.html#tempsession">tempsession</a>
option; if you don't like elvis' default behavior then you can change it.

<h2>10.2 Initialization</h2><a name="INIT"></a>

Elvis begins by initializing some options to hardcoded values.

<p>Elvis then chooses which user interface it should use.
Elvis does this by scanning the command line arguments for a
<strong>-G</strong><var>gui</var> flag; if there is no such flag,
then elvis tests each user interface and uses the best one that
is expected to work.
(For example, the "x11" interface is expected to work if there is a DISPLAY
environment variable and the X server is accessible.
If not, then the "x11" interface is rejected and some other interface
is used.)

<p>The session file is then opened or created.
For preexisting session files, elvis scans the session file for any buffers
in it, and adds them to its internal list.
Elvis can even reload the "undo" versions of some buffers.

<p>Elvis searches through the directories named in the
<a href="elvisopt.html#elvispath">elvispath</a> option for a file named
"elvis.ini".
If it finds that file, then it loads it into a buffer named "Elvis&nbsp;initialization" and executes its contents as a series of ex commands.
See <a href="#elvis.ini">section 10.2.1</a> for description of the default
contents of this file.

<p>After that, it attempts to similarly load some other files, but they
aren't executed.
Some of them will be executed later.
These files are:

<pre graphic>.-----------.----------------------.------------------------------.
| FILE NAME | BUFFER NAME          | PURPOSE                      |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| <a href="elvismsg.html#elvis.msg">elvis.msg</a> | Elvis messages       | used to translate messages   |
| <a href="#elvis.brf">elvis.brf</a> | Elvis before reading | executed before loading file |
| <a href="#elvis.arf">elvis.arf</a> | Elvis after reading  | executed after loading file  |
| <a href="#elvis.bwf">elvis.bwf</a> | Elvis before writing | executed before saving file  |
| <a href="#elvis.awf">elvis.awf</a> | Elvis after writing  | executed after saving file   |
^-----------^----------------------^------------------------------^
</pre>
The "elvis.msg" file is described in section
<a href="elvismsg.html">11: Messages.</a>
The other files are described later in this section.

<p>The next step in initialization is to load the first file and display
it in a window.
To do this, it first creates an empty buffer with the same name as the file.
It then executes the "Elvis before reading" buffer (if it exists) on the
empty buffer.
The file's contents are then read into the buffer.
Then the "Elvis after reading" buffer (if it exists) is executed on
the new buffer.
Finally, elvis creates a new window that shows the new buffer.

<p>If the <strong>-a</strong> flag was given on the command line, then
elvis will repeat the above steps for each file named on the command line.
On the other hand, if no filenames were given on the command line then
elvis will simply create a single untitled buffer and a window that shows it.


<h3>10.2.1 The "elvis.ini" file</h3><a name="elvis.ini"></a>

The "elvis.ini" file is loaded into a buffer named "Elvis&nbsp;initialization".
That buffer is then executed before any other initialization files are loaded.
If the session file is later restarted, this script will be executed again
at that time.
Here's a line-by-line analysis of the default "elvis.ini" file...


<pre>
	" DEFINE SOME DIGRAPHS
	if os == "msdos" || (os == "win32" && gui != "windows")
	then source! (elvispath("elvis.pc8"))
	else source! (elvispath("elvis.lat"))
</pre>
This attempts to locate the "elvis.lat" or "elvis.pc8" file and execute it.
The <a name="elvis.lat></a>"elvis.lat" file is an ex script which contains a
bunch of <a href="elvisex.html#digraph">:digraph</a> commands that set up the
digraph table appropriately for the Latin-1 symbol set.
The <a name="elvis.pc8></a>"elvis.pc8" file does the same for the PC-8
character set (also known as Code Page 437).
The "!" at the end of the <a href="elvisex.html#source">:source</a>
command name causes <tt>:source</tt> to silently ignore errors.

<pre>
	" CHOOSE SOME DEFAULT OPTION VALUES BASED ON THE INVOCATION NAME
	let p=tolower(basename(program))
	if p == "ex" || p == "edit"
	then set! initialstate=ex
	if p == "view"
	then set! defaultreadonly
	if p == "edit" || p == "vedit"
	then set! novice
	if home == ""
	then let home=dirdir(program)
</pre>
These lines initialize certain options according to the name by which
elvis was invoked.
Traditionally, invoking vi by the name "ex" causes it to start up in
ex mode instead of vi mode, and "view" causes the files to be treated
as readonly.

<pre>
	" SYSTEM TWEAKS GO HERE
	"
	" The Linux console can't handle colors and underlining.
	if gui=="termcap"
	then {
	 if term=="linux"
	 then set! nottyunderline
	}
</pre>
This is an attempt to work around a bug in the Linux console driver.
The Linux console can't mix color attributes with the underline attribute.
<pre>
	" X11 DEFAULT COLORS AND TOOLBAR GO HERE
	if gui=="x11"
	then {
	 color e darkgreen
	 color i saddlebrown
	 color u navyblue
	 color f #803
	 gui Save:w
	 gui Save?modified && edited && !readonly
	 gui Quit:q
	 gui Quit?!modified
	 gui gap
	 gui Make:make
	 gui Make?!modified
	 gui NextError:errlist
	 gui NextError?buffer("Elvis error list")
	 gui gap
	 gui Previous:N
	 gui Previous?!modified && current("previous")
	 gui Next:n
	 gui Next?!modified && current("next")
	 gui Alternate:e#
	 gui Alternate?!modified && previousfile
	 gui gap
	 gui Normal:no
	 gui Normal=display=="normal"
	 gui Hex:dis hex
	 gui Hex=display=="hex"
	 gui Other:eval dis (bufdisplay)
	 gui Other=display!="normal" && display!="hex"
	 gui Other?bufdisplay!="normal" && bufdisplay != "hex"
	 gui gap
	 gui Wrap:set negwrap
	 gui Wrap=wrap
	 gui List:se negli
	 gui List=li
	 gui Number:se negnu
	 gui Number=nu
	 gui gap
	 gui Help:help
	}
</pre>
These lines set the defaults for the "x11" user interface.
You should set the defaults here, and <em>not</em> in an app-defaults file.
If you aren't using the "x11" user interface, then these lines have no effect.
The <a href="elvisex.html#gui">:gui</a> commands define the default toolbar.

<pre>
	" EXECUTE THE STANDARD CUSTOMIZATION SCRIPTS
	let f=(os=="unix" ? ".exrc" : "elvis.rc")
	if $EXINIT
	then eval $EXINIT
	else source! ~/(f)
	if exrc
	then safer! (f)
</pre>
These lines set the <a href="elvisopt.html#f">f</a> option to either ".exrc"
or "elvis.rc", whichever is appropriate for your operating system.
They then check whether an environment variable named "EXINIT" is set
to a non-empty value.
If so, then the value of EXINIT is executed as an ex command line;
otherwise the ".exrc" or "elvis.rc" file in your home directory is
executed, if it exists.
The "~/" notation is UNIX's conventional alias for referring to files in your
home directory; elvis handles it correctly on non-UNIX systems too.
If EXINIT or .exrc/elvis.rc (whichever was executed) has set the
<a href="elvisopt.html#exrc">exrc</a> option then elvis will
execute ".exrc" or "elvis.rc" in the current directory, if it exists.
Elvis uses <a href="elvisex.html#safer">:safer</a> instead of
<a href="elvisex.html#source">:source</a> to execute the file
for security reasons.

<pre>
	" X11 INTERFACE DEFAULT FONTS GO HERE
	if gui == "x11"
	then if normalfont == ""
	then {
	 set! normalfont="*-courier-medium-r-*-18-*" 
	 set! boldfont="*-courier-bold-r-*-18-*" 
	 set! italicfont="*-courier-medium-o-*-18-*" 
	}
</pre>
These cause the x11 interface to use 18-point courier fonts, if you don't
explicitly name some other font on the command line
(<strong>-font</strong> <var>fontname</var>)
or by setting the normalfont option in your .exrc file.

<h3>10.2.2 The "elvis.brf" file</h3><a name="elvis.brf"></a>

The "elvis.brf" file is loaded into a buffer named
"Elvis before reading".
That buffer is executed immediately before loading any
user file into a user buffer.

<pre>
	" TAKE A GUESS AT THE BUFFER'S TYPE
	let e=tolower(dirext(filename))
	if e==".bin" || e==".dat"
	then set! binary
	if (os=="msdos" || os=="win32")
				&& (e=".exe" || e=".com" || e=".dll")
	then set! binary
</pre>
These lines try to guess whether the file is binary or not.
This must be done before the file is loaded because for non-binary
files elvis converts newlines to linefeeds as it reads the file.

<p>Note: The "if" line is split above merely as a typographical convenience.
In the real "elvis.brf" file, the "if" line and "&&" line are actually a
single line.

<h3>10.2.3 The "elvis.arf" file</h3><a name="elvis.arf"></a>

The "elvis.arf" file is loaded into a buffer named "Elvis after reading".
That buffer is automatically executed immediately after a user file has been
loaded into a user buffer.

<pre>
	" TAKE A GUESS AT THE BUFFER'S PREFERRED DISPLAY MODE
	let e=tolower(dirext(filename))
	if knownsyntax(filename)
	then set! bufdisplay=syntax
	else if os=="unix" && buflines >= 1
	then 1s/^#! *[^ ]*\/\([^ ]\+\).*/set! bufdisplay="syntax \1"/x
	if e&lt;&lt;4==".htm"
	then set! bufdisplay=html
	if e==".man" || e==".1"
	then set! bufdisplay=man
	if binary
	then set! bufdisplay=hex
</pre>
These lines try to guess the preferred display mode for the file.
First it checks to see if the filename's extension is listed in the
<a href="#elvis.syn">elvis.syn</a> file;
if so, then the buffer is shown in the <a href="elvisdm.html#syntax">syntax</a>
display mode.
Then, for UNIX, if the first line of the file starts with "#!shell",
elvis will use the <a href="elvisdm.html#syntax">syntax</a> display mode for
that named shell.
It then checks the filename's extension against a few common values for
other display modes.
Finally, if the buffer was loaded with the  <a href="elvisopt.html#binary">binary</a>
option turned on, then the <a href="elvisdm.html#hex">hex</a> display mode is used.

<pre>
	" EXECUTE MODELINES, IF "modelines" OPTION IS SET
	if modelines && buflines >= 1 && buflines <= modelines * 2
	then %s/ex:\(.*\):/\1/x
	if modelines && buflines > modelines * 2
	then {
	 eval 1,(modelines)s/[ev][xi]:\\\(.*\\\):/\1/x
	 eval (buflines - modelines + 1),(buflines)
	                                  s/[ev][xi]:\\\(.*\\\):/\1/x
	}
</pre>
These commands search for modelines in the newly loaded file,
if the <a href="elvisopt.html#modelines">modelines</a> option is set.
The modelines are executed via the new "x" option to the
<a href="elvisex.html#substitute">:s</a> command.

<p>Note: The second "eval" line is split above merely as a typographical
convenience.
In the real "elvis.arf" file, the "eval" line and "s" line are actually a
single line.

<h3>10.2.4 The "elvis.bwf" file</h3><a name="elvis.bwf"></a>

The "elvis.bwf" file is loaded into a buffer named "Elvis before writing".
That buffer is executed as a series of ex commands immediately before
writing the entire contents of a buffer out over its original file.

<pre>
	if backup && !newfile && os=="unix"
	then eval ! cp -f (filename) (basename(filename)).bak
	if backup && !newfile && os!="unix"
	then eval ! copy (filename) (basename(filename)).bak
</pre>
These lines copy the original version of the file to a "*.bak" file.
Note that we implement separate Unix and non-Unix versions of the
copy command here.

<h3>10.2.5 The "elvis.awf" file</h3><a name="elvis.awf"></a>

The "elvis.awf" file is loaded into a buffer named "Elvis after writing".
That buffer is executed as a series of ex command immediately after
writing the entire contents of a buffer out over its original file.

<p>There is no default "elvis.awf" file,
because I haven't found any need for one yet.

<h2>10.3 Recovery</h2><a name="RECOVER"></a>

If elvis ever dies an unnatural death, the session file will be left behind.
This session file contains all of the changes you've made during your edit
session, so you should be able to start a new elvis process on the
old session file and recover all of your changes.

<p>Only one elvis process at a time is allowed to use a given session file.
To enforce this, when elvis starts up it sets an "in use" flag in the
session file's header.
Any later elvis process will test that flag, and refuse to use a session
file which is already in use.

<p>When elvis crashes, it leaves the "in use" flag set, even though the
process that was using it has died.
You must restart your edit session via "<tt>elvis&nbsp;-r</tt>".
The <tt>-r</tt> flag tells elvis to ignore the "in use" flag.
If you aren't using the default session file, then you'll need to add a
"<tt>-f&nbsp;sessionfile</tt>" flag to tell elvis which session file it
should recover from.

<p>If you always use the default session file, and allow several old files
to accumulate after crashes, then "<tt>elvis&nbsp;-r</tt>" will always
recover from the lowest-numbered one.
The command "<tt>elvis&nbsp;-r&nbsp;-Gquit</tt>" will tell you its name.
If you prefer to recover form a different session file,
you can either delete the lower-numbered session files, or 
use the "<tt>-f&nbsp;sessionfile</tt>" flag to make elvis use a different
one.

<p>When this new elvis process starts up, it will be displaying a new,
empty buffer.
<strong>Don't panic!</strong>
Your edit buffers are still intact; they just don't happen to be displayed
in the initial window.

<p>After a crash, the session file might not be entirely self-consistent.
Because of this, it is dangerous to edit the file using this session file.
<strong>You should save your old buffer to a file immediately,
and then exit elvis.</strong>
To save your old buffer give elvis the command
"<tt>:(</tt><var>buffer</var><tt>)w </tt><var>filename</var>"
where <var>buffer</var> is the name of your buffer
(usually the same as the original file name) and
<var>filename</var> is the name of a new file where you wish to store the text.
Note that the buffer name should be in parentheses!
And for safety's sake, you should not write the salvaged buffer out over the top
of the original text file.

<p>Under normal circumstances elvis automatically deletes the session file
when it exits, but when recovering after a crash elvis is more cautious.
It never deletes a recovered session file itself.
After recovering your text and exiting elvis, you should manually delete the
session file via
"<tt>rm&nbsp;/var/tmp/elvis*.ses</tt>", or whatever the session file's name
is.
For DOS/Windows users, the command would be "<tt>DEL&nbsp;\TEMP\ELVIS*.SES</tt>".

<p>If you can figure out how to reproduce the problem, please let me know!

<h2>10.4 Other files</h2>
The following configuration files aren't really related to initialization
or sessions, but since we've discussed so many configuration files in this
chapter already, we might as well finish it off.

<dl>

<dt>*.man
<dd>These files are Unix-style "man pages" describing each of the programs.
You can view them with elvis' "man" display mode, or you can print them
via "troff -man ...".

<dt>elvis*.html
<dd>These files store the on-line interactive manual for elvis.
When you use the <a href="elvisex.html#help">:help</a> command, elvis
locates the necessary file and loads it.
These files are written in HTML so you can also view/print them using
a Web browser such as Netscape.

contents automatically.

<dt><a name="elvis.lat"></a>elvis.pc8
<dd>This file contains a bunch of <a href="elvisex.html#digraph">:digraph</a>
commands for setting up the digraph table for the PC-8 symbol set

<dt><a name="elvis.ps"></a>elvis.ps
<dd>The PostScript printer drivers (<a href="elvisopt.html#lptype">lptype</a>=ps
or ps2) include this file's contents in the printer output.
This file should contain PostScript code which defines the symbols
<tt>ElvisN, ElvisB,</tt> and <tt>ElvisI</tt> as 12-point monospaced fonts
to be used for normal text, bold text, and italic text, respectively.
It also defines <tt>ElvisPage, ElvisLeftPage,</tt> and <tt>ElvisRightPage</tt>
procedures for setting the size and position of a page's text on the paper.
If this file doesn't exist or is unreadable, elvis will use the following
