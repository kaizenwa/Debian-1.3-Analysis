<h1>9. Operating System Notes</h1>

Elvis 2.0 currently runs under <a href="#msdos">MS-DOS</a>,
<a href="#win32">MS-WindowsNT/MS-Winsdows95</a>,
and many versions of <a href="#unix">UNIX</a>.
This describes the quirks of each implementation.

<h2><a name="msdos"></a>9.1 MS-DOS</h2>

Elvis 2.0 was ported to MS-DOS by Steve Kirkendall, using code from
Guntram Blohm and Martin Patzel's MS-DOS port elvis 1.X.

<dl>

<dt>The "os" option
<dd>Under MS-DOS, the <a href="elvisopt.html#os">os</a> option's value is
"msdos".

<dt>The "shell" option
<dd>The default value of <a href="elvisopt.html#shell">shell</a> is
"C:\COMMAND.COM".
This can be overridden by the value of the COMSPEC environment variable.

<dt>The "lpout" option
<dd>The default value of the <a href="elvisopt.html#lpout">lpout</a> option
is "prn", which causes the
<a href="elvisex.html#lpr">:lpr</a> command to write its output directly
to the printer.

<p>I tried to make it use the spooler program, PRINT, but failed.
The first problem I ran into was the fact that PRINT can't read data from
stdin; it must be given the name of a file.
To work around this problem, I modified the osmsdos/osprg.c file to allow
$1 in the command line to be replaced by the name of elvis' temporary file
that contains the print data.

<p>This lead to the the second problem:
PRINT doesn't make a copy of the file, and elvis deletes the temporary file
as soon as PRINT exits.
Since PRINT exits before the file has been printed completely, this means
that the file is deleted before PRINT is through reading it.
The print job is truncated.
I was unable to find a way around this problem, so I gave up and just
set lpout=prn.

<dt>The "ccprg" option
<dd>The default value of the <a href="elvisopt.html#ccprg">ccprg</a> option
is "<tt>cl /c ($1?$1:$2)</tt>", which is appropriate for MSVC++ 1.5.
This way, you can run <a href="elvisex.html#cc">:cc</a> without arguments
to compile (but not link) the current source file.
If you supply arguments, they'll be used instead of the filename.

<dt>The "makeprg" option
<dd>The default value of the <a href="elvisopt.html#makeprg">makeprg</a> option
is "<tt>nmake -f ($1?$1:basename($2)".mak")</tt>", which is appropriate for
MSVC++ 1.5.
When <a href="elvisex.html#make">:make</a> is run without arguments, the
NMAKE program will be run on a *.MAK file with the same basename as the
current source file.
Or you can explicitly give a different *.MAK file name as an argument.

<dt>The "elvispath" option
<dd>The default value of the <a href="elvisopt.html#elvispath">elvispath</a>
option is "<tt>~\lib;~</tt>".
Note that elements of the path are separated with semicolons.
The ~ character is replaced by the value of the
<a href="elvisopt.html#home">home</a> option, which is usually the
name of the directory where ELVIS.EXE resides.

<dt>The "blksize" option
<dd>The <a href="elvisopt.html">blksize</a> option controls the size of
elvis' data blocks.
Under other operating systems this is usually 2048, but for MS-DOS is it
reduced to 512 because memory is tight.
(I'm trying to leave enough room in the lower 640k for the compiler to be
run from inside elvis.)

<p>If you're going to be editing a large file, you may want to increase the
block size.
The simplest way to do that is to invoke elvis with a "-b2048" argument.
<dt>The "TERM" environment variable
<dd>The TERM environment variable tells elvis how to access the screen.
If it is undefined, or set to "pcbios", then elvis will use BIOS calls to
access the screen.
This should work on all MS-DOS systems, but it isn't very fast.

<p>If TERM is set to "ansi" then elvis will output escape sequences which
are supported by the ANSI.SYS driver.
This isn't recommended;
ANSI.SYS is just as slow as the BIOS, and it isn't as powerful so elvis is
forced to redraw the screen instead of scrolling it, in some circumstances.

<p>If TERM is set to "nansi" then elvis will output escape sequences which
are supported by more capable drivers, such as NANSI.SYS and FANSI.SYS.
These drivers usually bypass the BIOS, so they are very fast.
If you're looking for a way to speed up elvis, this is probably your best bet.

</dl>

<h2><a name="win32"></a>9.2 MS-Windows95/MS-WindowsNT</h2>

Elvis 2.0 was ported to Windows95/WindowsNT by Steve Kirkendall.

<dl>
<dt>The "os" option
<dd>Under Windows95/WindowsNT, the <a href="elvisopt.html#os">os</a> option's
value is "win32".

<dt>The "shell" option
<dd>The default value of <a href="elvisopt.html#shell">shell</a> is "cmd".
If the COMSPEC environment variable is set (and it normally is),
then its value will be used instead of "cmd".
This is important, because Windows95 uses "COMMAND.COM" instead of "CMD.EXE".

<dt>The "lpout" option
<dd>The default value of the <a href="elvisopt.html#lpout">lpout</a> option
is "print $1", which causes the <a href="elvisex.html#lpr">:lpr</a> command
to print via the standard spooler.

<p>The "$1" is there to work around a problem: PRINT can't read data from
stdin.
It must be given the name of a file,
so I modified the oswin32/osprg.c file to allow
$1 in the command line to be replaced by the name of elvis' temporary file
that contains the print data.

<dt>The "ccprg" option
<dd>The default value of the <a href="elvisopt.html#ccprg">ccprg</a> option
is "<tt>cl /c ($1?$1:$2)</tt>", which is appropriate for MSVC++ 2.0 or later.
This way, you can run <a href="elvisex.html#cc">:cc</a> without arguments
to compile (but not link) the current source file.
If you supply arguments, they'll be used instead of the filename.

<dt>The "makeprg" option
<dd>The default value of the <a href="elvisopt.html#makeprg">makeprg</a> option
is "<tt>nmake -f ($1?$1:basename($2)".mak")</tt>", which is appropriate for
MSVC++ 2.0 or later.
When <a href="elvisex.html#make">:make</a> is run without arguments, the
NMAKE program will be run on a *.MAK file with the same basename as the
current source file.
Or you can explicitly give a different *.MAK file name as an argument.

<dt>The "elvispath" option
<dd>The default value of <a href="elvisopt.html#elvispath">elvispath</a>
is "<tt>~\elvislib;BIN;BIN\lib</tt>", where BIN is the name of the
directory where ELVIS.EXE resides.
Note that elements of the path are separated with semicolons.
The ~ character is replaced by the value of the
<a href="elvisopt.html#home">home</a> option, which is usually
C:\users\default for WindowsNT.

<p>Unlike MS-DOS, Win32 doesn't pass the full pathname of the .EXE file
as an argument to the program.
So the when the Win32 version of elvis starts up, the first thing it does
is search for ELVIS.EXE in your execution path.
It must do this in order to find the value to use as BIN.

<dt>The "TERM" environment variable
<dd>The TERM environment variable tells elvis how to access the screen.
It should probably be left undefined, or set to "console".
Other values have not been tested, but the following should work via
terminal emulators or whatever: dosansi, nansi, vt100, vt100w, and vt52.

<dt>Console size
<dd>Win32 distinguishes between a console's buffer size and its window size.
Many users like to set the buffer to a huge size (e.g., 100 lines) but leave
the window set at 25 lines.
They do this so they can scroll back and review earlier programs' output.

<p>When elvis starts, it creates a separate buffer which is the same size
as the window.
Elvis does this mostly so the scrollbar will go away.
If you change the buffer size while elvis is running, elvis will adjust
the size of the window to match the new buffer size, and then redraw the
text to take advantage of the new screen size.

<p>When you exit elvis, the console will revert to its original buffer and
original window size.

<dt>Mouse
<dd>The mouse should work, whether run in full-screen mode or in a window.
Dragging with the left, right, or both buttons pressed is will select
characters, whole lines, or a rectangular block, respectively.
Clicking the left button will cancel a pending text selection, and move
the cursor.
Clicking the right button will move the cursor; if a text selection is
pending, it will be extended to the new cursor position.
Double-clicking the left or right button will follow a hypertext reference
or return from one, respectively.

<p>There is a weird bug in WindowsNT's console mouse support.
If, when the console is shown in a window, part of that console is located
off-screen, then the mouse won't be able to move there, <em>even if you're
currently in full-screen mode!</em>
Since WindowsNT will sometimes resize your console when you switch between
full-screen and windowed modes, this might not be obvious.
But if the mouse refuses to move onto part of your full-screen console,
I suggest you switch back to windowed mode and reduce the size of your font
there.
When you switch back to full-screen mode again it will look exactly the same,
but the mouse should be able to go where no mouse has gone before.

<h2><a name="unix"></a>9.3 UNIX</h2>

Elvis was originally written under UNIX, so it seems strange to say I ported
it to UNIX, but I'll say it anyway:
Elvis 2.0 was ported to UNIX by Steve Kirkendall, with a lot of feedback
from many people on the net.

<p>Since elvis (and vi, for that matter) were originally designed and written
for UNIX, there aren't many quirks that show up for generic UNIX.
Most of this section will describe the quirks of individual
<a href="#versions">UNIX versions.</a>


<dl>

<dt>The "os" option
<dd>Under all versions of UNIX, the <a href="elvisopt.html#os">os</a> option's
value is "unix".

<dt>The "lpout" option
<dd>The default value of the <a href="elvisopt.html#lpout">lpout</a> option
is either "!lp -s" or "!lpr".
The choice is made by the <tt>configure</tt> script; if <tt>/usr/bin/lp</tt>
exists then it will use "!lp&nbsp;-s", else it will use "!lpr".

<dt>The "elvispath" option
<dd>The default value of <a href="elvisopt.html#elvispath">elvispath</a>
is usually <tt>~/.elvislib:/usr/local/lib/elvis</tt>.
The <tt>/usr/local/lib/elvis</tt> member of that path can be set via the
<strong>--datadir=</strong><var>directory</var> flag.

<dt>Missing functions
<dd>If your linker reports an undefined function, such as strdup(),
then you should check the <tt>need.h</tt> and <tt>need.c</tt> files;
they contain implementations of many such functions.
To use elvis' version of the missing function, edit the config.h file
and change "#undef NEED_XXX" to "#define NEED_XXX".

</dl>

<h3><a name="versions"></a>9.3.1  UNIX versions</h3>

The <tt>configure</tt> script works around most of the quirks of individual
UNIX versions.
Here, I will describe what <tt>configure</tt> does, or fails to do, for
each type of UNIX.

<dl>

<dt>SunOS and Solaris
<dd>SunOS and Solaris2 both claim to be SunOS, according to the <tt>uname</tt>
command.
However, their configuration is quite different, so the <tt>configure</tt>
script distinguishes between them by looking at the revision number output by
"<tt>uname -r</tt>".

<p>The SunOS port uses BSD's sgtty ioctl calls, instead of the POSIX calls,
even though SunOS supports the POSIX calls.
This choice was made because differences in signal handling
were preventing the SunOS port from responding to window resize signals.

<p>Solaris2 seems to have a bad implementation of rlogin, at least on the
system where I tested it.
It couldn't handle 2000-character write() calls.
Because this is a communication issue, and not purely a Solaris issue, I
decided to reduce the size of the output buffer for <em>all</em> systems
to 1500 bytes.

<p>The SunOS port uses termcap because I prefer it.
The Solaris port uses terminfo because Solaris doesn't seem to have a
termcap library.

<p>If you configure elvis to support X-windows, and your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable doesn't contain an X11 library directory, then
the <tt>configure</tt> script will output a warning message telling you
how to set that variable.
However, you might not need to set it; try running elvis without setting
it first.

<dt>OSF-1
<dd>This configuration is rather weird.
I don't have access to an OSF-1 system myself, so it's hard for me to
make it less weird.

<p>The primary weirdness is that it uses tinytcap.c (by defining NEED_TGETENT
in the config.h file) instead of the real terminfo functions.
I suggest you try compiling without NEED_TGETENT.

<dt>BSD
<dd>For BSD, <tt>configure</tt> will try to use the shlicc2 compiler if it
is available, so elvis can use shared libraries.

<p>Interestingly, the BSD port is configured to use POSIX ioctl calls instead
of BSD's own sgtty calls.
This may be a mistake.
If elvis fails to adjust when you resize your xterm,
then I suggest you add -DUSE_SGTTY to the end of the CC= line in Makefile,
and recompile.

<dt>SCO
<dd>SCO used to change the operating system name (as reported by the
"<tt>uname</tt>" command)
to match the network node name.
Does it still do that?
If "<tt>uname</tt>" doesn't output some string containing "sco" then you'll
need to explicitly give the name "sco" as an argument to the <tt>configure</tt>
script.

<p>When using an ANSI compiler,
SCO seems to require extern declarations of the termcap functions.
I added those declarations to the end of the "osunix/osdef.h" file.

<dt>Linux
<dd>Newer versions of Linux seem to have moved the definition of the speed_t
data type from its tradional location, <sys/types.h>.
The new location is <termios.h>, which makes sense since that's where the
legal values of speed_t are defined...
but because it is non-standard, I had to add a little extra code to the
"osunix/osdef.h" file to include <termios.h> for Linux.
