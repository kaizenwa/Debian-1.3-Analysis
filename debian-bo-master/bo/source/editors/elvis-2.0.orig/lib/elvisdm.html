<title>Elvis 2.0 Display Modes</title>
</head><body>

<h1>7. DISPLAY MODES</h1>

A "display mode" consists primarily of an algorithm that elvis uses
internally to convert the bytes in a buffer into an image in a window.
The same algorithm is also used for printing via the "<a href="elvisex.html#lpr">:lpr</a>" command.

<p>The display mode also affects tag lookup, and
image-dependent operations such as
determining the column number of the cursor's location, and
moving the cursor vertically.

<p>You can list the supported display modes by giving the
"<a href="elvisex.html#display">:display</a>" command without any arguments.
Typically, the supported modes will include the following:

<pre graphic>
.--------.----------------------------------------------.
|  MODE  | DESCRIPTION                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| <a href="#normal">normal</a> | Traditional vi, displays plain ASCII         |
| <a href="#syntax">syntax</a> | Like "normal" but does syntax coloring       |
| <a href="#hex">hex</a>    | Interactive hex dump, good for binary files  |
| <a href="#html">html</a>   | Simple Web page formatter                    |
| <a href="#man">man</a>    | Simple Man page formatter, like "nroff -man" |
^--------^----------------------------------------------^
</pre>

<p>Elvis 2.0 allows each window to be in a different display mode.
You can manually change a window's display mode via the
"<a href="elvisex.html#display">:display <var>mode</var></a>" command, where
<var>mode</var> is the name of a supported display mode.
There is also a "<a href="elvisex.html#normal">:no</a>" command,
which is short for ":display normal".

<h2>7.1 Options</h2>

There are two options which pertain to display modes:
<a href="elvisopt.html#display">display</a> and
<a href="elvisopt.html#bufdisplay">bufdisplay.</a>

<p>The <em>display</em> option is associated with a window.
It always contains the name of the window's current display mode.
You aren't allowed to change the value of this option directly;
you must use the ":display <var>mode</var>" command to change the display mode.
This option exists solely so that you can write EX scripts which behave
differently, depending on the display mode.

<p>The <em>bufdisplay</em> option is associated with a buffer.
It should be set to the name of the usual display mode for that buffer.
Typically this option will be set from the
<a href="elvisses.html#elvis.arf">elvis.arf</a> initialization file,
based on the name of the file like this:

<pre>
	let e=tolower(dirext(filename))
	if knownsyntax(filename)
	then set! bufdisplay=syntax
	else if os=="unix" && buflines >= 1
	then 1s/^#! *[^ ]*\/\([^ ]\+\).*/set! bufdisplay="syntax \1"/x
	if e&lt;&lt;4==".htm"
	then set! bufdisplay=html
	if e==".man" || e==".1"
	then set! bufdisplay=man
	if binary
	then set! bufdisplay=hex
</pre>
When a new window is created for that buffer, or
an existing window switches to that buffer,
that window's display mode will automatically be switched to the
<em>bufdisplay</em> mode.

<p>The <var>bufdisplay</var> mode also affects the <a href="elvisvi.html#^W">^Wd</a>
visual command.
This command toggles the window between the normal mode and the
<em>bufdisplay</em> mode.
If <em>bufdisplay</em> is also set to "normal", then <kbd>^Wd</kbd> will toggle between
the normal and hex display modes.


<h2><a name="normal"></a>7.2 Normal mode</h2>

The "normal" display mode looks like a traditional vi screen.
All characters are displayed literally except for the following...

<dl>

<dt>Tab
<dd>The tab character is displayed as a variable number of spaces --
however many are needed to move to the next tabstop position.

<dt>Newline
<dd>The newline character (linefeed) marks the end of a line.

<dt>Other control characters
<dd>Control characters other than tab and newline are displayed as a caret
and a printable ASCII character.
For example Control-A is displayed as ^A, and NUL is displayed as ^@.
The delete character is displayed as ^?.

<dt>Non-ASCII characters
<dd>The appearance of non-ASCII characters (i.e., characters 128-255) is
controlled by the <a href="elvisopt.html#nonascii">nonascii</a> option.
By default, most non-ASCII characters are assumed to be ordinary printable
characters.

</dl>

<h2><a name="syntax"></a>7.3 Syntax mode</h2>

The "syntax" display mode acts exactly like the normal mode, except that this
mode automatically uses different fonts for various types of tokens in any
supported programming language.

<h3>7.3.1 Options</h3>
The following options determine which font is used for each type of token:
<pre graphic>
.---------------------.------------------------------------------.
| OPTION NAMES        | AFFECTED TOKEN TYPE                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| <a href="elvisopt.html#commentfont">commentfont, cfont</a>  | <a href="#comment">comments</a>                                 |
| <a href="elvisopt.html#stringfont">stringfont, sfont</a>   | <a href="#string">string</a>, <a href="#character">character</a>, and <a href="#regexp">regexp</a> literals   |
| <a href="elvisopt.html#prepfont">prepfont, pfont</a>     | <a href="#preprocessor">preprocessor</a> directives                  |
| <a href="elvisopt.html#keywordfont">keywordfont, kfont</a>  | <a href="#keyword">keywords</a>                                 |
| <a href="elvisopt.html#functionfont">functionfont, ffont</a> | identifier followed by the <a href="#function">function</a> char |
| <a href="elvisopt.html#otherfont">otherfont, ofont</a>    | <a href="#other">other</a> special words                      |
| <a href="elvisopt.html#variablefont">variablefont, vfont</a> | variables, fields, etc.                  |
^---------------------^------------------------------------------^
</pre>

Each of those options can be set to one of <strong>normal, bold, italic,
underlined, emphasized,</strong> or <strong>fixed.</strong>
When typing these values into a <a href="elvisex.html#set">:set</a>
command line, you are only required to type the initial letter
(<strong>n, b, i, u, e</strong> or <strong>f</strong>). 

<p>Any text that doesn't fall into one of the above groups (punctuation, mostly)
is displayed in the <strong>normal</strong> font.
There is no option that controls this; it is hard coded.

<p>You can use the <a href="elvisex.html#color">:color</a> command to choose a
color for each font, if you wish.
Not all user interfaces support color, but the "x11" and "termcap" interfaces
do.

<h3><a name="elvis.syn"></a>7.3.2 Language specification</h3>

All supported languages are described in a file named "elvis.syn".
Each time a window switches to the "syntax" display mode,
elvis scans this file for a description of the language.
If it can't find a description of the language, then nothing will be
displayed in a different font;
"syntax" mode will look exactly like "normal" mode.

<p>The "elvis.syn" file is a text file.
In it, blank lines and lines which start with a '#' are ignored.
Other lines begin with the name of an attribute.
Each language's description begins with an attribute named "language".
The following lines (up to the next "language" line or the end of the file)
describe that language.

<p>The attributes names are:

<dl>

<dt>language
<dd>This word is followed by a whitespace-delimited list of language names.
The names are case-sensitive, so you should probably give all names in
lowercase so they're easier for the user to type in.
The user can indicate which language to use by appending its name to
the name of the "syntax" display mode.
For example, ":display syntax c++" causes elvis to highlight the text
appropriately for C++.

<dt>extension
<dd>This word is followed by the filename extensions which are commonly used
for this language.
If the user doesn't specify which language to load, then elvis scans through
"elvis.syn" for an extension line which matches the current file name.
The extension lines must come immediately after the language line.

<dt><a name="keyword"></a>keyword
<dd>This word is followed by a list of words which should be shown in the
<a href="elvisopt.html#keywordfont">keywordfont</a> font.
If omitted, then no words are shown in the keywordfont.
Long lists can be split into several keyword lines, if you wish.
Elvis doesn't care about the order of the words, but the list will be
easier to maintain if you keep it alphabetized.

<p>Elvis supports two forms of keywords...
<ul>
<li>Most keywords begin with an alphanumeric character or a character in the
<a href="#startword">startword</a> list, and continue with zero or more
characters which are alphanumeric or in the <a href="#inword">inword</a>
list.
<li>Rarely, you may find it convenient to have keywords which consist of
one or two punctuation characters, but which don't match the first form
of keywords.
This is mostly so that Perl's <tt>$#</tt> variable won't be displayed as a
simple dollar sign followed by a comment.
</ul>

<dt><a name="comment"></a>comment
<dd>This word is followed by a one- or two-character sequence which marks the
beginning of a comment.
The comment is assumed to end at the end of the line.
Comments are shown in the <a href="elvisopt.htlm#commentfont">commentfont</a>
font.

<p>It can also be followed by a <strong>pair</strong> of one- or two-character
sequences which mark the beginning and end of comments which can include
newlines.
Elvis allows you to specify one single-line comment style, plus one multi-line
comment style, for each language.

<dt><a name="preprocessor"></a>preprocessor
<dd>This word is followed by a single character which, when used at the
beginning of a line, marks the start of a preprocessor directive.
For C, this is the # character.
All preprocessor directives will then be shown in the
<a href="elvisopt.htmp#prepfont">prepfont</a> font.
If omitted, nothing is displayed in the prepfont.

<dt><a name="prepquote"></a>prepquote
<dd>This word is followed by a single character, or a pair of single characters,
which are used as the quote characters surrounding a file name in a preprocessor
directive.
For C, this is the &lt; and &gt; characters.
The name of the included file will then be displayed using the
<a href="elvisopt.html#stringfont">stringfont</a> font.
If omitted, then preprocessor file names will be highlighted as though they were
arithmetic expressions.

<dt><a name="function"></a>function
<dd>This word is followed by a single character which, if it appears
after a word, indicates that the word should be displayed in
the <a href="elvisopt.html#functionfont">functionfont</a> font.
For most languages, this will be a ( character.
If omitted, nothing is displayed in the functionfont.

<dt><a name="startword"></a>startword
<br><a name="inword"></a>inword
<dd>These can be followed by a list of punctuation characters which
may appear at the start of a word, or in the remainder of the word,
respectively.
Letters and digits are always legal in words; you don't need to list them.

<dt><a name="other"></a>other
<dd>This word indicates which types of words should be displayed in the
<a href="elvisopt.html#otherfont">otherfont</a> font.
If omitted, nothing is displayed in the otherfont.
It can be any combination of the following symbols:
<pre graphic>
.-------------.-------------------------------------------------.
| SYMBOL      | HOW TO RECOGNIZE "OTHER" WORDS                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| allcaps     | length >= 2 chars, no lowercase characters      |
| initialcaps | 1st character is uppercase, some are lowercase  |
| initialpunct| 1st character is punctuation, from "startword"  |
| mixedcaps   | 1st character is lowercase, some are uppercase  |
| final_t     | length >= 3 chars, ends with "_t"               |
^-------------^-------------------------------------------------^</pre>

<dt><a name="string"></a>string
<dd>This word is followed by a single character, or a pair of single characters, which are used as the quote
characters surrounding string literals.
For C, this is the &quot; character.
String literals will then be displayed using the
<a href="elvisopt.html#stringfont">stringfont</a> font.
If omitted, then strings will not be recognized.

<dt><a name="character"></a>character
<dd>This word is followed by a single character, or a pair of single characters, which are used as the quote
characters surrounding character literals.
For C, this is the ' character.
This is shown using the
<a href="elvisopt.html#stringfont">stringfont</a> font, like strings.
When parsing, the only difference between the two is that characters can't
span lines, but strings can.

<dt><a name="regexp"></a>regexp
<dd>This word is followed by a list of characters which can be used
for delimiting a regular expression,
which some languages support as a means for specifying strings with
metacharacters.
(See <a href="elvisre.html">Section 5</a> of this manual for a description of
elvis' own implementation of regular expressions, which is a typical example.)
Regular expressions are displayed using the
<a href="elvisopt.html#stringfont">stringfont</a> font.

<p>Note that <tt>regexp</tt> accepts a list of characters, while
<tt>string</tt> and <tt>character</tt> support only a single character.
This is because many programming languages allow the programmer to choose
from a variety of delimiting characters.

<dt><a name="useregexp"></a>useregexp
<dd>The most commonly used delimiter for regular expressions is '/',
which many languages also use as the division operator.
To avoid mistakenly displaying the division operator as the start of a
regular expression, elvis must be sensitive to the context in which it
is used.
That's what this word is for.
The <tt>useregexp</tt> word is followed by a list of
<a href="#keyword">keywords</a> and/or punctuation characters which allow the
next character to be recognized as a regular expression.
Additionally, regular expressions are allowed at the start of a line.

<dt><a name="useregsub"></a>useregsub
<dd>This is used for listing <a href="#keyword">keywords</a> and punctuation
characters which may be followed by a regular expression
<em>and then substitution text.</em>

<dt>ignorecase
<dd>This word should be followed by <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.
If <strong>true</strong>, then elvis won't distinguish between uppercase and
lowercase letters when testing whether a word is a keyword
(except that in the elvis.syn file, the keywords should be listed in lowercase).
If omitted, elvis assumes it should be <strong>false.</strong>

<dt>font
<dd>This word can be used to cause certain keywords to be displayed in
some font other than the <a href="elvisopt.html#keywordfont">keywordfont</a>.
The first word after <tt>font</tt> should be the name of the font
(<strong>normal, fixed, bold, emphasized, italic,</strong> or <strong>underlined</strong>) or a one-letter
abbreviation of a font name.
The line's remaining words are keywords which will be displayed in that font.
</dl>

<h3>7.3.3 Example</h3>

The <a href="elvis.syn">elvis.syn</a> file shipped with elvis contains some
good examples of language descriptions.
Here's an excerpt from it, describing the Java language.
<pre>
language java
extension .java .jav
keyword abstract boolean break byte byvalue case cast catch char
keyword class const continue default do double else extends false
keyword final finally float for future generic goto if implements
keyword import inner instanceof int interface long native new null
keyword operator outer package private protected public rest return
keyword short static super switch synchronized this throw throws
keyword transient true try var void volatile while
comment	//
comment /* */
function (
string "
character '
startword _
inword _
other allcaps initialcaps</pre>

<p>There is no preprocessor line, because java doesn't use a preprocessor.
The "allcaps" and "initialcaps" symbols are given so that constants and class
names will be shown in the <a href="elvisopt.html#otherfont">otherfont.</a>

<h2><a name="hex"></a>7.4 Hex mode</h2>

The "hex" display mode is an interactive hex dump of the buffer.
This is good for examining or editing binary files.

<p>One handy feature is the ability to enter characters in hex
(either in <a href="elvisinp.html">input mode</a> or as the argument to an
<a href="elvisvi.html#r">r</a> visual command)
by typing <kbd>^X</kbd> followed by two hex digits.
This feature is always available regardless of the display mode...
but this is where is it most useful.


<h2><a name="html"></a>7.5 HTML mode</h2>

HTML is the language used for constructing pages on the World Wide Web.
Elvis' "html" display mode supports a subset of HTML, which it uses for
displaying the online help documentation (including this very document).

<p>HTML is a markup language.
This means that documents contain a mixture of text and formatting instructions.
In HTML there are two types of instructions, called <a href="#htmltags">tags</a>
and <a href="#htmlentities">entities.</a>
When the document is processed by a program such as Netscape or elvis (in
html mode), the tags are are stripped out, the entities are converted to
a kind of text, and the text is formatted and presented to the user.
Ordinarily the user will never see the tags.

<p>Since elvis is primarily an editor, not a viewer, it has two options which
allow the tags to become visible:
the <a href="elvisopt.html#showmarkups">showmarkups</a> option causes a tag to become
visible if the cursor is moved onto it, and
the <a href="elvisopt.html#list">list</a> option makes all tags visible
regardless of the cursor position.

<p>There are a lot of good "How To Use HTML" documents on the Net.
<em>This is not one of them!</em>
I don't intend to do much more than describe the quirks of elvis'
implementation of HTML here.

<p>I added HTML support to elvis mostly to support the online help.
Consequently, if a feature is hard to implement and the online documentation
doesn't use it, then I didn't implement that feature.

<h3><a name="htmltags"></a>7.5.1 Formatting tags</h3>

Elvis supports the following HTML tags.
Unsupported tags are silently ignored.

<dl>

<dt>&lt;html&gt; ... &lt;/html&gt;
<dd>The entire document should be enclosed in these tags.
They don't actually do anything to help format the document,
but they may help programs recognize that the document is in fact written in
HTML.

<dt>&lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt;
<dd>These should be used to bracket the document's header, if it has one.

<dt>&lt;title&gt; ... &lt;/title&gt;
<dd>These tags are only legal in the document's header.
Any text between the 
&lt;title&gt; and &lt;/title&gt; tags will be stored internally as the
title of the document.
If you print the document, elvis will display the title at the top of each
page.

<dt>&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt;
<dd>These should be used to bracket the body of the document.
They don't actually do anything in elvis, but real Web browsers such as
Netscape allow you to specify backgrounds and patterns via BGCOLOR=... and BACKGROUND=...
arguments, respectively.

<dt>&lt;h1&gt; ... &lt;/h1&gt;
<dd>These tags bracket the most visible type of section header.
Elvis displays &lt;h1&gt; ... &lt;/h1&gt; headers in boldface,
flush against the left edge of the page.
When printing, these headers cause a page break.

<dt>&lt;h2&gt; ... &lt;/h2&gt;
<dd>These bracket the second most visible type of section header.
Elvis displays &lt;h2&gt; ... &lt;/h2&gt; headers in boldface,
indented slightly from the left edge.
When printing, these may cause a page break if they would otherwise appear
near the bottom of a page.

<dt>&lt;h3&gt; ... &lt;/h3&gt;
<dd>These bracket the third most visible type of section header.
Elvis displays them in boldface, indented fully from the left edge so
that it lines up with normal text.

<dt>&lt;h4&gt;...&lt;/h4&gt;
<br>&lt;h5&gt;...&lt;/h5&gt;
<br>&lt;h6&gt;...&lt;/h6&gt;
<dd>These are very minor section headers.
Conventional wisdom says that if you're using this many section headers then
you would probably do better to split your document into several smaller
documents.
Elvis displays these headers in an italic font.

<dt>&lt;p&gt;
<dd>This tag should be placed at the start of each normal paragraph,
with the possible exception of the first paragraph after a section header.
It causes a blank line to be generated, and any later text to appear starting
on a new line.

<dt>&lt;br&gt;
<dd>This causes any later text to appear starting on a new line.
It differs from &lt;p&gt; in that &lt;br&gt; doesn't output a blank line.

<dt>&lt;hr&gt;
<dd>This outputs a "horizontal rule" -- a line all the way across the page.

<dt>&lt;img alt=...&gt;
<dd>Elvis can't display graphics, but if it encounters an &lt;img&gt; tag
which has an alternate text form (as denoted by an img="text" parameter)
then it'll display the alternate text.
Otherwise elvis will display the entire tag, even if all other tags are hidden.

<dt>&lt;blockquote&gt; ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;
<dd>This is used to mark a large chunk text which is quoted from another source.
Elvis will indent the enclosed text.

<dt>&lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;
<dd>This brackets text which has already been preformatted by the document's author.
Elvis will treat tabs and newlines literally.
(Outside of &lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;, they would normally be treated like
spaces.)
This has been used for presenting tables, poetry, and source code examples.

<p>In fact, elvis has an extension that is useful for tables:
If you start with &lt;pre graphic&gt; then elvis will convert certain
characters into graphic line-drawing characters.
When adjacent to a hyphen character, the hyphen, period, caret are converted
into appropriate graphic characters.
Additionally, the vertical bar character is always converted to a graphic
character.
The following was done with a plain &lt;pre&gt;...
<pre>
.--.--.
|--|--|
|  |  |
^--^--^
</pre>... and this was done with &lt;pre graphic&gt;...
<pre graphic>
.--.--.
|--|--|
|  |  |
^--^--^

<dt>&lt;table&gt;...&lt;/table&gt;
<br>&lt;tr&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;
<br>&lt;th&gt;...&lt;/th&gt;
<br>&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
<dd>These are used for implementing tables in HTML 3.0.
Each table should be enclosed in a &lt;table&gt;...&lt;/table&gt; pair.
Within the table, each row should be delimited with a &lt;tr&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt; pair.
Within each row, the information for each column should be enclosed in
either a &lt;th&gt;...&lt;/th&gt; pair for headers,
or a &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt; pair for data.

<p>Elvis doesn't really support these tags very well.
Only the bare essentials of these commands have been implemented.
They are intended to make tables recognizable as being tables,
but not necessarily make them easy to read.

<dt>&lt;dir&gt;...&lt;/dir&gt;
<br>&lt;xmp&gt;...&lt;/xmp&gt;
<dd>These are treated almost exactly like &lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;.
There are supposed to be some differences, but elvis doesn't support those differences.

<dt>&lt;dl&gt; ... &lt;/dl&gt;
<dd>These are used to bracket a list of definitions.
The definitions themselves are marked with the &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt;
tags, described below.

<dt>&lt;dt&gt;
<dd>The text after this tag is used as a term to be defined.
Elvis displays this text in bold face, indented by the same amount as
normal text.
This is only legal in a &lt;dl&gt;...&lt;/dl&gt; pair.

<dt>&lt;dd&gt;
<dd>The text after this tag is used as the definition of a term.
Elvis displays it in the normal font, indented somewhat more than
normal text or the &lt;dt&gt; text.
This is only legal in a &lt;dl&gt;...&lt;/dl&gt; pair.

<dt>&lt;ol&gt; ... &lt;/ol&gt;
<dd>These are used to enclose an ordered list.
The official specifications say that lists may be nested inside one another,
but elvis doesn't allow ordered lists to appear inside any other type of list.
If a document uses &lt;ol&gt; ... &lt;/ol&gt; inside another list,
then elvis will act as though  &lt;ul&gt; ... &lt;/ul&gt; had been used instead.
This means that the list items will be marked with bullets instead of numbers.
Within the list, &lt;li&gt; tags are used to mark the items.

<dt>&lt;ul&gt; ... &lt;/ul&gt;
<dd>These enclose an unordered list.
Each item in the list should be marked with a &lt;li&gt; tag.

<dt>&lt;menu&gt; ... &lt;/menu&gt;
<dd>These enclose an unordered list, like &lt;ul&gt; ... &lt;/ul&gt;,
but other Web readers may display &lt;menu&gt; ... &lt;/menu&gt; lists
in a more compact manner.

<dt>&lt;li&gt;
<dd>This is used to mark the start of a new item in a list.

<dt>&lt;input type=... size=... value=...&gt;
<br>&lt;textarea cols=...&gt;
<dd>Elvis can display a mockup of a form, so you can have some idea of how
the form would look on a real browser.
<strong>The forms won't really work in elvis!</strong>
Elvis displays forms for the sole purpose of helping you define the form layout.
Buttons are displayed as reverse-video characters,
and text input areas are displayed as underlined spaces.
The &lt;textarea&gt; image is always 3 rows high, regardless of any rows=...
value you supply.

<dt>&lt;a&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;
<dd>There are two forms of this tag:
&lt;a href=<var>URL</var>&gt;...&lt;/a&gt; to mark the source of a hypertext
link, and
&lt;a name=<var>name</var>&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to mark the destination of a hypertext
link.

<p>Elvis doesn't support non-local URLs.
The URL can only contain a filename and/or the name (prefixed by a '#' character) of some &lt;a name=<var>name</var>&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tag.

<dt>&lt;cite&gt; ... &lt;/cite&gt;
<dd>These enclose a citation.  Elvis displays the citation in italics.

<dt>&lt;dfn&gt; ... &lt;/dfn&gt;
<dd>These enclose a term that is being defined.  Elvis displays the term
in italics.
Netscape doesn't support this tag, so you should probably avoid it.
Use &lt;em&gt; ... &lt;/em&gt; instead.

<dt>&lt;em&gt; ... &lt;/em&gt;
<dd>These enclose text which should be emphasized some way.
Elvis displays the text in (you guessed it) italics.

<dt>&lt;kbd&gt; ... &lt;/kbd&gt;
<dd>These enclose text which the user might want to type into the computer
some day.
Elvis displays this text in boldface.

<dt>&lt;strong&gt; ... &lt;/strong&gt;
<dd>These enclose text which should be emphasized a heck of a lot.
Elvis displays this text in boldface.

<dt>&lt;var&gt; ... &lt;/var&gt;
<dd>These enclose text which indicates where some variable argument is to be
placed.  Elvis displays this text in italics.

<dt>&lt;address&gt; ... &lt;/address&gt;
<dd>These enclose an address.  Elvis displays the address in italics.
Note that this is typically used for e-mail addresses and Web URLs,
not postal addresses.

<dt>&lt;b&gt; ... &lt;/b&gt;
<dd>The enclosed text is displayed in bold.
The &lt;strong&gt; ... &lt;/strong&gt; tags are the preferred, if you really
want to emphasize text.

<dt>&lt;i&gt; ... &lt;/i&gt;
<dd>The enclosed text is displayed in italics.
The &lt;em&gt; ... &lt;/em&gt; tags are the preferred, if you really
want to emphasize text.

<dt>&lt;u&gt; ... &lt;/u&gt;
<dd>The enclosed text is displayed underlined.
You should avoid using this tag, because underlining is also used to
indicate hypertext links.  The &lt;u&gt; ... &lt;/u&gt; text would look like
a hypertext link but wouldn't work like one.

<dt>&lt;tt&gt; ... &lt;/tt&gt;
<dd>The enclosed text is displayed in normal font.
Other HTML readers make the distinction of displaying the text in a
<em>monospaced</em>
normal font, but since elvis always uses monospaced fonts, the distinction is
lost.
These tags are typically used for marking computer commands when they're
mentioned in the body of a paragraph.

</dl>

<p>Note that most of these tags come in pairs, and the ending tag's name
includes a '/' character.
Elvis doesn't verify that the pairs match up correctly.
Because of this, I strongly suggest that you preview your document using
a more powerful HTML viewer such as Netscape before sharing it with the
world.


<h3><a name="htmlentities"></a>7.5.2 Character entities</h3>

Most text characters can be given literally in an HTML file,
but some need special treatment.
The most notable are &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, and non-ASCII characters.
HTML uses character entities to support them.

<p>Many of the entities are automatically derived from the digraph table.
If you don't know about digraphs, you should look up the
<a href="elvisex.html#digraph">:digraph</a> command, and the discussion
on how to use them in <a href="elvisinp.html">input mode.</a>

<p>Elvis supports the following character entities:

<dl>

<dt>&amp;lt; or &amp;LT;
<dd>The &lt; character.

<dt>&amp;gt; or &amp;GT;
<dd>The &gt; character.

<dt>&amp;amp; or &amp;AMP;
<dd>The &amp; character.

<dt>&amp;quot; or &amp;QUOT;
<br>&amp;ldquo; or &amp;LDQUO;
<br>&amp;rdquo; or &amp;RDQUO;
<dd>The &quot; character.

<dt>&amp;lsquo; or &amp;LSQUO;
<dd>The &lsquo; character.

<dt>&amp;rsquo; or &amp;RSQUO;
<dd>The &rsquo; character.

<dt>&amp;nbsp; or &amp;NBSP;
<dd>A non-breaking space.
This is displayed as a space character.
It differs from plain old whitespace in that &amp;nbsp; can't be converted
into a line break.

<dt>&amp;copy; or &amp;COPY;
<dd>The copyright symbol (&copy;).
Elvis looks for a digraph which combines the letters c and O.
If there is no such digraph, then elvis uses c.

<dt>&amp;reg; or &amp;REG;
<dd>The registered trademark symbol (&reg;).
Elvis looks for a digraph which combines the letters r and O.
If there is no such digraph, then elvis uses r.

<dt>&amp;AELIG;
<dd>A digraph combining the letters A and E.
If no such digraph has been defined, then elvis will display E.

<dt>&amp;aelig;
<dd>A digraph combining the letters a and e.
If no such digraph has been defined, then elvis will display e.

<dt>&amp;ETH;
<dd>A digraph combining a hyphen and the letter D.

<dt>&amp;eth;
<dd>A digraph combining a hyphen and the letter d.

<dt>&amp;THORN;
<dd>A digraph combining the letters T and P, or just plain P if there
is no such digraph.

<dt>&amp;thorn;
<dd>A digraph combining the letters t and p, or just plain p if there
is no such digraph.

<dt>&amp;szlig;
<dd>A digraph combining the letters s and z, or just plain z if there
is no such digraph.

<dt>&amp;<var>letter</var>grave;
<dd>A digraph combining the ` and <var>letter.</var>

<dt>&amp;<var>letter</var>acute;
<dd>A digraph combining the ' and <var>letter.</var>

<dt>&amp;<var>letter</var>circ;
<dd>A digraph combining the ^ and <var>letter.</var>

<dt>&amp;<var>letter</var>tilde;
<dd>A digraph combining the ~ and <var>letter.</var>

<dt>&amp;<var>letter</var>uml;
<dd>A digraph combining the " and <var>letter.</var>

<dt>&amp;<var>letter</var>ring;
<dd>A digraph combining the * and <var>letter.</var>

<dt>&amp;<var>letter</var>cedil;
<dd>A digraph combining the , and <var>letter.</var>

<dt>&amp;<var>letter</var>slash;
<dd>A digraph combining the / and <var>letter.</var>

<dt>&amp;#<var>number</var>;
<dd>The character whose ordinal value is <var>number.</var>
This should be avoided, because you can't be sure which symbol set will be used
when somebody else views the document.
Some documents use &amp;#160; which is a "hard" space in the ISO Latin-1
character set, but they should really use &amp;nbsp;.

</dl>

<p>If your document uses a character entity which elvis doesn't support,
then elvis will not convert that entity into a single character;
instead, it will be displayed literally.

<p>If elvis looks for a digraph containing a punctuation character and
a letter, and no such digraph has been defined, then elvis will use the
plain ASCII letter.

<h3>7.5.3 Using hypertext</h3>

<p>The HTML hypertext has been implemented as a variation on the standard
vi :tag command.
Consequently, all of the wonderful commands that elvis offers for browsing
C source code can also be used for browsing HTML documents.

<p>In EX mode, you can use <a href="elvisex.html#tag">:tag <var>URL</var></a>
to pursue a hypertext reference, and <a href="elvisex.html#pop">:pop</a> to come back afterward.

<p>In VI mode, you can move the cursor onto the underlined text which
denotes a hypertext reference, and hit <a href="elvisvi.html#^]">^]</a> to
pursue the reference, and <a href="elvisvi.html#^T">^T</a> to come back
afterward.
Also, when in html mode the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key searches forward for
the next hypertext reference, and the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key performs tag
lookup just like the <kbd>^]</kbd> key.

<p>If you're using the "x11" user interface, then you can double-click
button 1 to follow a hypertext reference, and double-click button 3 to
come back afterward.  This also works under Win32, because the Win32
version of the "termcap" interface supports the mouse.

<h2><a name="man"></a>7.6 Man mode</h2>

The man display mode uses a markup language,
as does the <a href="#html">html</a> display mode.
The difference is that the man display mode's markup language resembles
that of "troff -man".
It is used for formatting entries in the UNIX user manuals.

<p>Elvis supports only a tiny subset of the troff commands and -man macros.
It is adequate for a surprising number of man pages, though.
The most notable failing is the lack of number/string registers.

<p>Commands which start with a "." are only recognized at the start of a line.
The remainder of the line is used as arguments to the command.
Commands which start with a "\" are recognized anywhere.

<dl>

<dt>.\" <var>comment</var>
<dd>Elvis ignores any text on a .\" command line.

<dt>.TH <var>name section</var>
<dd>This command should appear at the top of the man page.
It declares the name of the program to be described,
and the section of the manual where it should appear.
User programs are usually documented in section 1.

<dt>.SH <var>name</var>
<dd>The <var>name</var> is displayed as a section header.
If <var>name</var> contains whitespace, then it should be enclosed in quotes.
Man pages usually have sections named NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION,
OPTIONS, FILES, ENVIRONMENT, "SEE ALSO", BUGS, and AUTHOR,
in that order.
The "elvis.man" file is a typical example.

<dt>.SS <var>name</var>
<dd>The <var>name</var> is displayed as a subsection header.
If <var>name</var> contains whitespace, then it should be enclosed in quotes.
Man pages rarely use subsections.

<dt>.B <var>text</var>
<dd>The text is displayed in boldface.

<dt>.I <var>text</var>
<dd>The text is displayed in italics.

<dt>.SM <var>text</var>
<dd>Troff would display the text in a slightly smaller font.
Elvis doesn't support multiple font sizes, though, so it simply outputs the
text.

<dt>.RB <var>text1 text2 ...</var>
<br>.BR <var>text1 text2 ...</var>
<br>.RI <var>text1 text2 ...</var>
<br>.IR <var>text1 text2 ...</var>
<br>.BS <var>text1 text2 ...</var>
<br>.SB <var>text1 text2 ...</var>
<dd>These output the argument text, alternating between two fonts.
For example, .BR outputs the first argument word in boldface,
the second in normal (a.k.a. Roman), the third in boldface again, and so on.
The "S" font is supposed to be small, but elvis uses the normal font for that.
All whitespace is removed from between the argument words.

<dt>.IP <var>label</var>
<dd>This starts an indented paragraph.  The <var>label</var>, if given,
is output before the paragraph, and without indentation.
This is typically used for presenting a term (the label) and its definition
(the paragraph).

<dt>.TP</var>
<dd>This starts a hanging paragraph.
That's like a .IP indented paragraph, except the label is declared on the
line following the command, instead of on the command line itself.
The body of the paragraph starts on the second line after the command line.

<dt>.P
<br>.LP
<dd>Either of these will start a regular paragraph.

<dt>.RS
<br>.RE
<dd>These start and end a relative indentation, respectively.
In other words, .RS increases the indentation of any subsequent text,
and .RE reduces indentation.

<dt>.br
<dd>This causes a line break.

<dt>.sp
<dd>This causes a line break, and then leaves a blank line.

<dt>.nf
<br>.fi
<dd>These turn "fill mode" off and on, respectively.
When fill mode is turned off, elvis will perform much less formatting.
It is similar to the &lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt; tags in HTML.

<dt>.DS
<br>.DE
<dd>These mark the beginning and end of a "display."
Inside the display, "fill mode" is turned off, just as it is for the .fi
and .nf markups.
The real troff tries to avoid page-breaks inside a display, but elvis isn't
that smart.

<dt>\e
<dd>This is replaced by the backslash character.

<dt>\|
<br>\&
<dd>These are deleted.
If you ever feel a need to put a period at the start of a line, and don't
want it to be treated like a command line, then put \&. in your file.
The \& will prevent the period from being interpreted as the start of a
command line, but will not show in the output.

<dt>\fB
<br>\f1
<dd>Switch to boldface.

<dt>\fI
<br>\f2
<dd>Switch to italics.

<dt>\fR
<br>\f0
<dd>Switch to the normal font.

<dt>\fP
<dd>Switch to the default font for this context.
That's boldface in headings, and normal the rest of the time.
Actually, \fP is supposed to switch to the "previous" font, whatever that
was, but elvis doesn't do it that way.

<dt>\*
<br>\n
<dd>In the real troff, these are used for accessing the value of a string
or numeric register, respectively.
Elvis doesn't support registers; it'll just display the \* or \n expression
literally.

<dt>\<var>character</var>
<dd>When <var>character</var> is something other than one of the above,
output the <var>character</var>.
In particular, \\ outputs a single backslash.

</dl>

<p>
Troff source was never designed to be interactively edited, and although
I did the best I could, attempting to edit in "man" mode is still a
disorienting experience.
I suggest you get in the habit of using "normal" mode
when making changes, and "man" mode to preview the effect of those changes.
The <a href="elvisvi.html#^Wd">^Wd</a> command makes switching between modes 
a pretty easy thing to do.

<p>Unrecognized commands which start with "." are silently ignored.

<p>Unrecognized commands which start with "\" will be output without the
initial "\" character.
This falls far short of the ideal, but there are just too many weird
escapes to bother implementing in something that isn't being advertised
as a troff clone.
(NOTE: Elvis is not a troff clone.)

<p>A tip: If your document contains sequences which look like \*X or \*(XY
(for any characters X and Y), then it is trying to use defined strings.
Look for a ".ds X foo" command near the top of the document to find out what
that string is supposed to look like.
The string \*(bu is a bullet character.
