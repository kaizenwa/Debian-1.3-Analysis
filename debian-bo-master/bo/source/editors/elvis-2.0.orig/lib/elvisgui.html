<title>Elvis 2.0 User Interfaces</title>
</head><body>

<h1>8. USER INTERFACES</h1>

A single elvis binary can be compiled to support multiple user interfaces.
For example, under UNIX elvis can be compiled to have a graphical user
interface when run under X-windows, a termcap interface for use on most
text terminals, an "open" interface for use on any terminal, and a "quit"
interface for running scripts.

<p>The exact list of available user interfaces will vary from one system to
another.
You can make elvis output a list of available interfaces by running
"<tt>elvis -G?</tt>".
This will also show you which interface elvis will use by default.

<p>Elvis chooses the default user interface at run time by testing each
user interface in turn, starting with the most desirable, and working its
way down the list until it finds one that appears to be supported in the
current environment.
For example, if you're using elvis on a text terminal under UNIX, then
elvis will bypass the "x11" interface because X-windows doesn't work on
text terminals, and then elvis will find that the "termcap" interface
would work, so that'll be the default.

<p>If you don't want to use the default user interface,
you can specify which interface to use via the
<strong>-G</strong> <var>gui</var> command-line flag.

<h2>8.1 X11 Interface</h2><a name="x11"></a>

The x11 interface is used under X-Windows on UNIX systems.
It provides a scrollbar and mouse support, and allows you to
select which fonts to use.
Fonts are specified via command-line flags;
there is no way to change fonts after elvis has created the first window.

<p>The x11 interface doesn't read an app-defaults file.
Instead, defaults fonts and colors are controlled via
<a href="elvisopt.html#GUI">options</a> which are usually set in the
<a href="elvisses.html#elvis.ini">elvis.ini</a> or elvis.rc file.

<h3>8.1.1 X11 Command-line Flags</h3>

To specify a normal font, use <strong>-font</strong> <var>fontname</var> or
<strong>-fn</strong> <var>fontname.</var>
Proportional fonts are not supported.
If you don't specify a normal font, then elvis will use a font named "fixed"
by default.

<p>To specify a bold font, use <strong>-fb</strong> <var>fontname.</var>
The specified font should have the same size character cell as the normal
font, but elvis does not verify this.
If you don't specify a bold font, then elvis will fake it by smearing the
normal font rightward one pixel.

<p>To specify an italic font, use <strong>-fi</strong> <var>fontname.</var>
The specified font should have the same size character cell as the normal
font, but elvis does not verify this.
If you don't specify an italic font, then elvis will fake it by sliding the
top half of the normal font rightward one pixel.

<p>If you want to use Courier fonts, there is a shortcut:
<strong>-courier</strong> <var>size</var> will use the normal, bold,
and italic versions of the courier font in the requested size.

<p>Elvis has a built-in icon, which is generally a good thing.
Some window managers won't allow you to assign a new icon to a program that
has a built-in one, so elvis has a <strong>-noicon</strong> flag which
disables the built-in icon.

<p>Elvis also supports the <strong>-geometry</strong> <var>WxH+X+Y</var> flag
for specifying the size and/or position of the first window.

<p>The <strong>-client</strong> option causes elvis to look for an
already-running elvis process on the same X server, and if there is one,
send the new arguments to it.
This causes the old elvis process to create new windows for file arguments.
The new elvis process then exits, leaving the old one to do the real work.

<h3>8.1.2 X11 Mouse</h3>

I've tried to reach a balance between the mouse behavior of
<strong>xterm(1)</strong> and what makes sense for an editor.
To do this right, elvis has to distinguish between clicking and dragging.

<p>Dragging the mouse always selects text.
Dragging with button 1 pressed (usually the left button) selects characters,
dragging with button 2 (the middle button) selects a rectangular area, and
dragging with button 3 (usually the right button) selects whole lines.
These operations correspond to elvis' 
<a href="elvisvi.html#v">v</a>,
<a href="elvisvi.html#^V">^V</a>, and
<a href="elvisvi.html#V">V</a> commands, respectively.
When you release the button at the end of the drag, the selected text is
immediately copied into an X11 cut buffer, so you can paste it into another
application such as xterm.
The text remains selected, so you can apply an operator command to it.

<p>Clicking button 1 cancels any pending selection, and moves the cursor to
the clicked-on character.
Clicking button 3 moves the cursor without canceling the pending selection;
you can use this to extend a pending selection.

<p>Clicking button 2 "pastes" text from the X11 cut butter.
If you're entering an ex command line, the text will be pasted into the
command line as though you had typed it.
If you're in visual command mode or input mode, the text will be pasted into
your edit buffer.
When pasting, it doesn't matter where you click in the window; elvis always
inserts the text at the position of the text cursor.

<p>Double-clicking button 1 simulates a <a href="elvisvi.html#^cbra">^]</a>
keystroke, causing elvis to perform tag lookup on the clicked-on word.
If elvis happens to be displaying an HTML document, then tag lookup
pursues hypertext links so you can double-click on any underlined text
to view the topic that describes that text.
Double-clicking button 3 simulates a <a href="elvisvi.html#^T">^T</a> keystroke,
taking you back to where you did the last tag lookup.

<h3><a name="x11.toolbar"></a>8.1.3 Toolbar</h3>

The X11 interface supports a user-configurable toolbar.
By default, the toolbar is disabled unless your ~/.exrc file has a
<tt>"set&nbsp;toolbar"</tt> command, or
you give a <b>-ft</b>&nbsp;<var>toolfont</var> flag when invoking elvis.
Currently, the <a href="elvisopt.html#toolbar">toolbar</a> option can only
be changed during initialization; after the first window has been created,
its value is locked.

<p>Once enabled, you will find that the default toolbar already has some
buttons defined.
You can use the <a href="elvisex.html#gui">:gui</a> command to reconfigure
the toolbar.
The following commands are supported:

<dl>

<dt>:gui newtoolbar
<dd>This deletes all buttons from the toolbar.

<dt>:gui gap
<dd>This leaves a small gap between the previous button and the following
button.

<dt>:gui <var>label</var> : <var>excommand</var>
<dd>This creates a button named <var>label</var>.
Whenever you click the button, the <var>excommand</var> will be interpretted
as an ex command line.
The <var>label</var> can begin with any non-whitespace character.
The remaning characters can be letters, digits, or another instance of the
initial character.

<dt>:gui <var>label</var> = <var>condition</var>
<dd>Normally buttons are drawn as though sticking out;
this command gives you a way to make them selectively appear to be stuck in.
The <var>condition</var> is a <a href="elvisexp.html#13.1">C-like expression.</a>
When it is true, the button will be drawn "sticking in".
When it is false, the button will be drawn "sticking out".
The button behaves exactly the same either way.

<dt>:gui <var>label</var> ? <var>condition</var>
<dd>This gives you a way to selectively disable the button.
The <var>condition</var> is a <a href="elvisexp.html#13.1">C-like expression.</a>
When it is true, the button behaves as normal;
when it is false, the button ignores any mouse clicks.
Also, buttons which are disabled this way are displayed as being "flat",
instead of the normal 3D shading that makes them appear to stick out or in.

</dl>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>
The <var>condition</var> expressions are re-evaluated after nearly
every input event.
If you have many complex expressions, this may take a noticable amount of
time.
With the default toolbar, elvis seems to slow down by about 20%.
Toolbar buttons which don't use <var>condition</var> expressions have
no such overhead.

<h2>8.2 Termcap Interface</h2><a href="termcap"></a>

The termcap interface is the one you'll use most often on non-graphic terminals.
It looks and acts a heck of a lot like the traditional vi.
The biggest addition is the support for multiple windows.
(For more information on how to use multiple windows, start elvis and give
the command <a href="elvisvi.html#^W">:help ^W</a>.)

<p>If your terminal supports ANSI color escape sequences, then you can
use the <a href="elvisex.html#color">:color</a> command to assign different
colors to the six basic fonts:
normal, bold, italic, underlined, emphasized, and fixed.
You must assign a normal color first, e.g., ":color normal yellow".

<p>There are three additional options when using the termcap interface:
<a href="elvisopt.html#term">term,</a>
<a href="elvisopt.html#ttyrows">ttyrows,</a>and
<a href="elvisopt.html#ttycolumns">ttycolumns.</a>
The term option contains the name of the termcap entry being used;
it should correspond to the type of terminal you're using.
The ttyrows and ttycolumns options give the size of the screen.

<p>Under Win32, there is also a <a href="elvisopt.html#codepage">codepage</a>
option for detecting or changing the current code page.
Win32's termcap interface also supports the mouse,
using basically the same rules as the x11 interface.
The only differences are that it doesn't cut & paste via the clipboard,
and pressing both buttons of a two-button mouse will simulate pressing
the missing middle button.

<h3>8.2.1 Termcap, Terminfo, and tinytcap</h3>

<em>Termcap</em> is a database of terminal characteristics, and a library
of C functions for accessing that database.
It was created at Berkeley to allow the original vi editor to be
terminal-independent.
Elvis' termcap user interface was written to use this.

<p>AT&T created the <em>terminfo</em> database and library, adding a few
minor features.
Most modern UNIX systems use terminfo instead of termcap.
Fortunately, terminfo's library contains functions which emulate the
termcap functions, so the termcap interface can be compiled to work with
the terminfo library.

<p>The <tt>tinytcap.c</tt> file contains a simple reimplementation of the
termcap library, for those systems (such as MS-DOS) which don't have either
a real termcap, or terminfo.
Tinytcap's database is hard-coded into it;
to add or modify a terminal description, you need to edit tinytcap.c and
recompile elvis.

<h3>8.2.2 Common termcap values</h3>

This section describes most the termcap values used by elvis.
The values which deal with cursor keys and graphic characters will be
described in the following sections.

<p>Termcap field names are two characters long.
Some names supply Boolean values, and others supply numeric or string values.
A Boolean value is made true by giving the name; the absence of its name in
a terminal's entry indicates a false value for that field, for that terminal.
For numeric fields, the name is followed by a '#' character and then decimal
digits specifying the value.
For string fields, the name is followed by a '=' character and then a string.
Fields are delimited by ':' characters.

<h3>8.2.3 Cursor Keys and Function Keys</h3>

Cursor keys and function keys generally send escape sequences when struck.
Elvis needs to know what those escape sequences are, so it can recognize
the keystroke and act accordingly.

<p>The names of the fields for the arrows are pretty well standardized in
termcap, but the other cursor keys are still rather unsettled.
Different UNIX variants use different names for the same key.
Elvis supports all common names for each key.

<p>Function keys are even more challenging.
Originally termcap only had strings which described the first 4 function keys.
This was easy to extend to 9 keys, but starting with the 10th function key
things get strange because termcap field names must be two characters long.
Also, there was no way to describe shift-function keys, control-function keys,
or alt-function keys, so I invented by own fields for them.

<p>The following table lists all of the key field names, and the keys they
refer to.
For keys which may be described via more than one field name, the preferred
field name is listed first.
It also lists the key's label, as reported by <a href="elvisex.html#map">:map</a>
and what (if anything) that key is normally mapped to.

<h3>8.2.4 Graphic characters</h3>

Elvis uses graphic characters for HTML mode's
&lt;pre graphic&gt; and &lt;hr&gt; tags.

<p>Originally termcap didn't support a way to access the terminal's
graphic characters.
A standard of sorts was eventually developed under the XENIX variant of UNIX.
Later, the terminfo library adopted a different way to access the graphic
characters, and this was worked back into the termcap standard, displacing
the XENIX standard.
The terminfo method is preferred, these days.
Elvis supports both.

<pre graphic>
                      Terminfo Strings
.-------.---------------------------------------------------.
|TERMCAP|                                                   |
| FIELD |                  DESCRIPTION                      |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------|
| :as=: |Start graphic text                                 |
| :ae=: |End graphic text                                   |
| :ac=: |Maps VT100 graphic chars to this terminal's chars  |
^-------^---------------------------------------------------^
</pre>

The terminfo method uses the :as=:ae=: strings for turning the
graphical character attribute on and off.
While in graphic mode, the value of the :ac=: string is interpreted
as a list of character pairs;
the first character is a VT-100 graphic character,
and the following character is this terminal's corresponding graphic character.
The following table lists the (text versions of) VT-100 graphic characters,
and descriptions of them.
It also includes IBM PC characters.

<pre graphic>
   .--------.--------.--------------------------------------.
   | VT-100 | IBM PC |             DESCRIPTION              |

So, for example, an entry describing the IBM PC would contain the following:
<xmp>
:ac=q\304x\263m\300v\301j\331t\303n\305u\264l\332w\302k\277:

In Xenix, a separate string is used for each line-drawing graphic
character.
There are also optional :GS=:GE=: strings for starting and ending graphic mode.
If the :GS=:GE=: strings aren't specified,
then termcap is expected to set the MSB of each character in the graphic
character strings.


<h2>8.3 Open Interface</h2><a name="open"></a>

The <em>open</em> interface was created for use on terminals which lack some
necessary capability (such as the :cm=: cursor movement command),
or terminals of an unknown type.
The open interface is ugly;
if you have a choice, you should always use the termcap interface instead.

<p>The open interface works on all text terminals because the only control
codes it uses are backspace, carriage return, and line feed.

<p>It only allows you to edit one line at a time.
When you move to a new line (e.g., by using the <a href="elvisvi.html#j">j</a>
or <a href="elvisvi.html#k">k</a> commands), the screen scrolls up and the
new line is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
This is true even when you're moving the cursor back towards the beginning
of the edit buffer;
the lines of the buffer will appear on the screen in reverse order!
The open interface can be very confusing.

<p>However, practically all of the normal visual commands are available.
The only ones missing are those that specifically affect a whole window.

<h2>8.3 Quit Interface</h2><a name="quit"></a>

The <em>quit</em> interface is intended to be used for executing scripts
of ex commands.
It performs all of the usual initialization, and then quits.
It is normally used in conjunction with the <strong>-c</strong> <var>command</var>
flag.

<p>For example, you can have elvis load a file, print it, and then exit
via the following command line...
<xmp>
elvis -G quit -c lp <var>somefile</var>
</xmp>

Because the usual initialization guesses a file's display mode
automatically, this one command can be used to format and print HTML documents,
man pages, C code, and possibly hex dumps of binary files.
