<p><strong>HINT:</strong> If you're reading this via elvis' built-in
<a href="elvisex.html#help">:help</a>
command, then you should probably begin by reading about
<a href="elvisex.html#help">:help</a>
itself.  To do that, move the cursor onto the word
"<a href="elvisex.html#help">:help</a>"
and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

<h1><a name="WHATIS"></a>1. WHAT IS ELVIS?</h1>
Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor.
Elvis supports nearly all of the vi/ex commands,
in both visual mode and ex mode.
Elvis adds support for multiple files, multiple windows, a variety of
display modes, on-line help, and other miscellaneous extensions.

<p>Like vi/ex, Elvis stores most of the text in a temporary file,
instead of RAM.
This allows it to edit files that are too large to fit
in a single process' data space.
Also, the edit buffer can survive a power failure or crash.

<p>Elvis 2.0 runs under the following operating systems:
<ul>
<li>UNIX.  If you have X-windows, elvis can use a graphical interface, in addition to the traditional text-based interface.
<li>MS-Windows/95 and Windows/NT.  Currently it can only run as a console
application (text-based interface); hopefully this will change soon.
The mouse is supported here.
<li>MS-DOS.  It can also run in a DOS window under Windows 3.1.
<li>OS/2 (not yet, but soon).  Elvis will offer a graphical interface here, too.
</ul>

<p>Elvis is freely redistributable, in either source form or executable form.
There are no restrictions on how you may use it.

<h2>1.1 About this manual</h2>
This document is written in HTML.
You should be able to view it with any Web browser, such as Mosaic or Netscape.
These browsers also allow you to print the manual, if you prefer.

<p>You can also use elvis to view it or print it;
elvis has a built-in HTML display mode.
To print this document using elvis, you must first set some
<a href="elvisopt.html#LPR">printer options.</a>
After that, you can just load any of these files,
maybe set the display mode to HTML via the command ":display html"
(if elvis doesn't set the display mode automatically),
and then give the command ":lp".

<p>Each chapter is stored in a separate file;
you'll need to print each one separately.

<h2>1.2 Overview of Elvis</h2>
The user interface of Elvis/vi/ex is weird.
There are two major command modes in Elvis, and a few text input modes as well.
Each command mode has a command which allows you to switch to the other mode.

<p> You will probably use the <a href="elvisvi.html">visual command mode</a>
most of the time.
This is the mode that Elvis normally starts up in.

<p> In visual command mode, the entire screen is filled with lines of text
from your file.
Each keystroke is interpreted as part of a visual command.
If you start typing text, it will <em>not</em> be inserted,
it will be treated as part of a command.
To insert text, you must first give an "insert text" command, such as
<a href="elvisvi.html#i">i</a>.
This will take some getting used to.
(An alternative exists.
Look up the <a href="elvisopt.html#initialstate">initialstate</a> option.)

<p> The <a href="elvisex.html">ex mode</a> is quite different.
Elvis displays a ":" character on the bottom line of the screen, as a prompt.
You are then expected to type in a command line and hit the <b>Enter</b> key.
The set of commands recognized in the ex mode is different
from visual mode's.
