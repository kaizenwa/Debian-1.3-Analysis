<p>Elvis can evaluate expressions involving numbers, strings, and boolean values,
using a C-like syntax.
These are used in several EX commands, one VI command, and a couple of other
situations.

<p>There are two syntaxes.
The normal syntax is extremely similar to C, and is used in circumstances
where you probably would never use a literal value, such as for the
<a href="elvisex.html#if">:if</a> command.
The simpler syntax makes literal values easier to enter, while still
making the full power of the expression evaluator available if you need it.

<h2><a name="13.1"></a>13.1 Normal (C-like) Syntax</h2>

The <a href="elvisex.html#calculate">:calculate</a> command uses the normal syntax
and displays the results.
We'll use it for most of the examples in this section.

<p>The normal syntax is intended to resemble the syntax of the C programming
language very closely.
You can't define your own functions or use flow-control constructs though;
you can only use expressions.
In traditional C documentation, these would be called "rvalues."
Basically that means you can use literal values, option names, operators,
parentheses, and some built-in functions.

<h3>13.1.1 Primary expressions</h3>
Literals can be given in any of the following formats:
<dl>
<dt>"<var>text</var>"
<dd>Any text in double-quotes is taken literally.
The usual C escapes (such as "\n") are <strong>not</strong> supported.
<dt>\<var>character</var>
<dd>Any non-alphanumeric character preceded by a backslash, outside of quotes, is taken
as a string literal of length one.
A backslash followed by an alphanumeric character is taken as a string literal
of length two which contains both the backslash and the alphanumeric character.
<dt><var>digits</var>
<dd>Any word which contains only digits will be taken as a literal value.
Generally this value will be interpreted as a number,
but internally the expression evaluator always stores values as strings.
Some operators look at their arguments and act differently depending
on whether those strings happen to look like numbers or Boolean values.
<dt>0<var>octaldigits</var>
<br>0x<var>hexdigits</var>
<br>'<var>character</var>'
<dd>Octal, hex, and character constants can be used expressions.
These are converted to decimal when they are parsed, before they are passed to any operator or function.
Passing an octal, hex, or character constant therefore is exactly like
passing the equivalent decimal number.
Elvis supports escapes as character constants:
'\0', '\b', '\E', '\f', '\n', '\r', and '\t'.
</dl>
<p>There is no special way to enter Boolean literals.
All of the boolean operators accept "false", "0", and "" as
Boolean <strong>false</strong> values, and
anything else as a Boolean <strong>true</strong> value.
If you want to enter a Boolean literal, just use the string literals
"true" and "false".

<p>The following examples produce <em>exactly</em> identical results.
<xmp>
:calc "8"
8
:calc 8
8
:calc 010
8
:calc 0x8
8
:calc '\b'
8
</xmp>

<p>You can also use option names in elvis the same way you would use variable
names in C.
<xmp>
:calc list
false
:calc scroll
12
:calc display
normal
</xmp>

<p>Additionally, a dollar sign followed by the name of an environment variable
is replaced by the value of that environment variable.  If there is no such
environment variable, then elvis will act as though it exists and has a
null value.

<p>In some circumstances, you can use a dollar sign followed by a digit
to access special arguments.
This is used in error messages and also in the values of a few options,
as described in <a href="#13.6">section 13.6.</a>
These special arguments can only be supplied by elvis' internal code,
and it only supplies them in a few special circumstances so you can't use
them in <a href="elvisex.html#calculate">:calculate,</a> for example.

<h3>13.1.2 Operators</h3>
The following operators are available.
When passed integer values, these operators act like their C counterparts.
When passed string values, most of them concatenate
their arguments with the operator name in between, but some of them
do something that is useful for strings,
as described below.
Items at the top of this list have a higher precedence than those lower down.
<dl>
<dt>~
<dd>Perform a bitwise NOT operation on the argument, if it is a number.
<dt>!
<dd>Return <strong>true</strong> if the argument is <strong>false</strong>
and vice versa.
<dt>* / %
<dd>The usual arithmetic operators.  (% is the modulo operator.)
<p>Also, the / operator can be used to combine a directory name and a file name,
to form an absolute pathname.
Here are some examples showing how this works in DOS:
<xmp>
:set dir home
directory=C:\temp  home=C:\
:calc dir/"tempfile"
C:\temp\tempfile
:calc home/"elvis.rc"
C:\elvis.rc</xmp>
<dt>+ -
<dd>The usual arithmetic operators.
Note that there is no special unary - sign; the minus sign serves double-duty.
Because C normally gives the unary - sign a higher precedence than
other operators and elvis doesn't, you may occasionally need to enclose
negated values in parentheses to achieve the same effect.
<dt>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
<dd>For integers these operators perform bitwise shifting, exactly like C.
However, if the left argument is a string and the right argument is a number
then elvis will pad or truncate the string to make its length match the
number argument.
&lt;&lt; pads/truncates on the right, and &gt;&gt; pads/truncates on the left.
<xmp>
:calc \[("port" &lt;&lt; 6)\]
[port  ]
:calc \[("starboard" &gt;&gt; 6)\]
[rboard]</xmp>
<dt>&lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;= == !=
<dd>Compare the arguments and return <strong>true</strong> if the comparison
holds, and <strong>false</strong> otherwise.
If both arguments look like numbers, then they will be compared as numbers;
otherwise they will be compared as strings.
<dt>&amp;
<dd>Bitwise AND of the arguments, if they're numbers.
<dt>^
<dd>Bitwise XOR of the arguments, if they're numbers.
<dt>|
<dd>Bitwise OR of the arguments, if they're numbers.
<dt>&amp;&amp;
<dd>Returns <strong>false</strong> if either argument is one of the
three false string values, and <strong>true</strong> otherwise.
<dt>||
<dd>Returns <strong>false</strong> if both arguments are one of the
three false string values, and <strong>true</strong> otherwise.
<dt>?:
<dd>This one is tricky because internally elvis always uses binary operators.
In C this is a ternary operator but in elvis it is implemented as two binary
operators which cooperate in a subtle way so they seem like a single ternary
operator.
You probably don't need to know the details, but the upshot of it all is
that 1) It associates left-to-right (instead of right-to-left as in C), and
2) The : and third argument are optional; if omitted, then elvis mentally
sticks :"" on the end of the expression.
<dt>(no operator)
<dd>Any two expressions placed side-by-side with no operator between them will
be concatenated as strings.  C does this for literal strings, but elvis does
it for anything.
</dl>

<h2><a name="13.2"></a>13.2 Simpler Syntax</h2>
The simpler syntax makes it easier to enter literal strings because
outside of parentheses the only special characters are the backslash,
dollar sign, and parentheses.
Inside parentheses, the normal syntax is used.

<p>The <a href="elvisex.html#eval">:eval</a> command uses the simpler syntax,
and the <a href="elvisex.html#echo">:echo</a> command displays its arguments.
These commands can be used together to experiment with the simpler syntax,
the same way we used <a href="elvisex.html#calculate">:calculate</a> to experiment with
the normal syntax.
<xmp>
:eval echo TERM=$TERM
TERM=xterm
:eval echo home=(home)
home=/home/steve
:eval echo 2+2=(2+2)
2+2=4
</xmp>

<h2><a name="13.3"></a>13.3 Functions</h2>
There are several built-in functions.
When you call one of these functions, there must <strong>not</strong> be any
whitespace between the function name and the following parenthesis.
The built-in functions are:
<pre graphic>
.------------------.--------------------------------------------.
| FUNCTION(ARG)    | RETURN VALUE                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| strlen(string)   | number of characters in the string         |
| toupper(string)  | uppercase version of string                |
| tolower(string)  | lowercase version of string                |
| isnumber(string) | "true" iff string is a decimal number      |
| hex(number)      | string of hex digits representing number   |
| octal(number)    | string of octal digits representing number |
| char(number)     | convert number to 1 ASCII char, as a string|
| exists(path)     | "true" iff file exists                     |
| dirperm(path)    | string indicating file attributes          |
| dirfile(path)    | filename.ext part of a path                |
| dirname(path)    | directory part of a pathname               |
| dirdir(path)     | directory, like dirname(file)              |
| dirext(path)     | extension (including the . )               |
| basename(path)   | filename without extension                 |
| elvispath(file)  | locate a file in elvis' configuration path |
| knownsyntax(file)| "true" iff file's extension is in elvis.syn|
| buffer(bufname)  | "true" iff buffer exists                   |
| current(item)    | value indicating an aspect of elvis' state |
| feature(name)    | "true" iff a given feature is supported    |
^------------------^--------------------------------------------^
</pre>
Some of these deserve further comment.

<p>The <strong>isnumber()</strong> function uses the same test that the operators use
when deciding whether to use the string version or the number version of
their behavior.
You can use <strong>isnumber()</strong> to predict how operators will behave.

<p>The <strong>hex()</strong> and <strong>octal()</strong> functions return
strings which look like C-style hex or octal constants, respectively.
The <strong>isnumber()</strong> function will return <strong>false</strong>
when passed one of these strings; they are no longer considered to be
numbers.
In fact, the only reason you can use hex and octal literals is because they
are converted into decimal strings by the parser, before evaluation even
begins.
The following example demonstrates that hex literals are converted to decimal,
and that the value returned by <strong>hex()</strong> is something else.
<xmp>
:calc strlen(0xff)
3
:calc strlen(hex(255))
4
</xmp>

<p>The <strong>char()</strong> function returns a one-character string;
that character's decimal value will be the argument number.
For example, "<tt>char(65)</tt>" returns "A".
Note that the returned value does <em>not</em> look quite like
a character constant.

<p>The <strong>dirperm()</strong> function returns one of the following
strings to indicate the file's type and permissions:
<dl>
<dt>"invalid"
<dd>The argument is malformed; it could not possibly be a valid file name.
<dt>"badpath"
<dd>The argument is a pathname, and one or more of the directories named
in that pathname either doesn't exist or is something other than a directory.
<dt>"notfile"
<dd>The argument is the name of something other than a file;
for example, it may be a directory.
<dt>"new"
<dd>There is no file, directory, or anything else with the given name.
<dt>"unreadable"
<dd>The file exists but you don't have permission to read it.
<dt>"readonly"
<dd>The file exists and you can read it, but you don't have permission to write
to it.
<dt>"readwrite"
<dd>The file exists and you can read or write it.
</dl>

<p>The <strong>elvispath()</strong> function searches through the directories
listed in the <a href="elvisopt.html#elvispath">elvispath</a> option's value,
looking for the argument file name.
If it is found, then the full pathname of the file is returned;
otherwise it returns a null string.

<p>The <strong>knownsyntax()</strong> function determines whether
the given file can be displayed in the <a href="elvisdm.html#syntax">syntax</a>
display mode.
It does this by looking for the file name extension in the
<a href="elvisdm.html#elvis.syn">elvis.syn</a> configuration file.

<p>The <strong>current()</strong> function examines elvis' internal variables,
and returns a string indicating the value of one of them.
The argument determines which variable is examined, as follows:
<dl>
<dt>current("line")
<dd>Current line number.
<dt>current("column")
<dd>Current column number.
<dt>current("word")
<dd>The word at the cursor location.
If the cursor isn't on a word, then this returns an empty string.
<dt>current("mode")
<dd>Current key parsing mode.
This returns the same string that the
<a href="elvisopt.html#showmode">showmode</a> option displays, except that this
function converts it to all lowercase, and strips out whitespace.
The usual return values are "command", "input", and "replace".
If the window isn't editing the its main buffer (i.e., if you're entering
an ex command line, regular expression, or filter command) then this function
will return an empty string.
<dt>current("selection")
<dd>Visible selection type.
This returns one of "character", "rectangle", or "line" to indicate the type
of visible selection which is currently marked in the window, or
an empty string if no visible selection is marked.
<dt>current("next")
<dd>Next file.
This returns the name of the file that the <a href="elvisex.html#next">:next</a>
command would load, or an empty string if you're at the end of the args list.
<dt>current("previous")
<dd>Previous file.
This returns the name of the file that the
<a href="elvisex.html#previous">:previous</a> command would load, or
an empty string if you're at the start of the args list.
<dt>current("tagstack")
<dd>If the window's tag stack is empty, this returns "".
Otherwise it returns the name of the buffer to which
<a href="elvisex.html#pop">:pop</a> would move the cursor.
</dl>

<p>The <strong>feature()</strong> function is intended to allow you to write
EX scripts which work with different configurations of elvis.
For example, you can compile elvis without support for the hex display mode;
if you do that, then <tt>feature("hex")</tt> will return <strong>false.</strong>
Currently <strong>feature()</strong> returns <strong>true</strong> for all
supported display modes, and <strong>false</strong> for anything else.
As new features (not necessarily display modes) are added to future versions
of elvis, I expect to add them to <strong>feature()</strong>'s list.


<h2><a name="13.4"></a>13.4 EX Commands Which Use Expressions</h2>
The <a href="elvisex.html#calculate">:calculate</a> command evaluates its
argument using the normal syntax, and displays the result.

<p>The <a href="elvisex.html#if">:if</a> command evaluates its argument using
the normal syntax.
If the resulting value is any Boolean <strong>true</strong> value then a
flag is set; otherwise the flag is reset.
After that, you can use <a href="elvisex.html#then">:then</a> and
<a href="elvisex.html#else">:else</a> commands to conditionally execute some
commands, depending on the state of that flag.

<p>The <a href="elvisex.html#eval">:eval</a> command evaluates its arguments
using the simpler syntax.
The resulting string value is then interpreted as an EX command line.
This gives you a way to use the expression evaluator with commands which
otherwise wouldn't evaluate expressions.

<p>The <a href="elvisex.html#let">:let</a> command allows you to change the
values of options.
Its syntax is "<tt>:let <var>option</var>=<var>expression</var></tt>",
where <var>expression</var> is any expression using the normal syntax.
You can use this to change the value of any unlocked option,
similarly to <a href="elvisex.html#set">:set.</a>
<xmp>
:set i=14
:calc i
14
:let i=i+1
:set i?
i=15
:eval set i=(i*2)
:calc i
30

:let elvispath="."
:let list="false"
:let sidescroll=0x10
</xmp>

<h2><a name="13.5"></a>13.5 VI Commands Which Use Expressions</h2>
There is only one way to use expressions in a visual command:
Move the cursor to the start of some expression in your edit buffer,
hit the lowercase <kbd>v</kbd> key, move to the other end, and
then hit the <kbd>=</kbd> key.
Elvis will then evaluate the highlighted expression, and replace the original
expression with the result.

<p>Note that the <a href="elvisvi.html#=">=</a> operator only works this way
when used with the <a href="elvisvi.html#v">v</a> command for marking characters.
If you visibly mark lines, or use the traditional <kbd>=</kbd><var>movement</var>
syntax, then elvis will send the selected lines though the external filter
program named in the <a href="elvisopt.html#equalprg">equalprg</a> option.

<p>The <a href="elvisvi.html#hash">#</a> command doesn't use expressions, but
it does perform some simple math.

<h2><a name="13.6"></a>13.6 Other Uses of Expressions</h2>

<h3>13.6.1 Messages</h3>
All of elvis' warning and error messages are actually expressions,
using the simpler syntax.
When outputting a message, elvis may supply other parameters which are
accessible as <strong>$1</strong> through <strong>$9.</strong>
See the <a href="elvismsg.html">Messages</a> chapter for a longer description
of how elvis handles messages.
<h3>13.6.2 Options</h3>
The <a href="elvisopt.html#ccprg">ccprg</a> and
<a href="elvisopt.html#makeprg">makeprg</a> options' values are expressions,
using the simpler syntax.
When evaluating these expressions, <strong>$1</strong> is replaced by
whatever arguments are supplied on the ex command line, and <strong>$2</strong> is replaced by the
the name of the file being edited.

<h3>13.6.3 File Names</h3>
File names are evaluated as expressions (using the simpler syntax),
primarily as a means for expanding environment variable names.
This is done prior to wildcard expansion.

<p>The full power of the expression evaluator is available; you can use
it to do more than just expand environment variable names.
For example, you could store the name of a file in one of the user
options, and then later use that option name in parentheses wherever
a filename was expected.
<xmp>
:set f=myfile.txt
:w (f)
wrote myfile.txt, ...
</xmp>

<p>If you use this trick, remember that it only works when elvis is expecting
a file name.
It won't work when invoking external programs, because elvis doesn't know
which program arguments are supposed to be file names.
Elvis always passes program arguments literally.

<p>Recall that when a backslash character is followed by an alphanumeric
character, both the backslash and the alphanumeric character become part
of the resulting value.
This was done mostly for the benefit of file names.
If the backslash was always dropped
then MS-DOS users would have a heck of a time entering pathnames of files!
By making the backslash a little smarter, we avoid that problem.
<xmp>
:eval echo c:\tmp \(notice the backslashes\)
c:\tmp (notice the backslashes)
</xmp>

<p>To simplify the task of writing portable ex scripts,
the behavior of the <strong>/</strong> operator has been extended.
When one or both of its arguments are strings, it concatenates them as
a directory name and a file name, yeilding a full pathname.
