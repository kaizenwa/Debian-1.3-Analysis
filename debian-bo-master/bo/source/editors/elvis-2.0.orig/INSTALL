HOW TO COMPILE & INSTALL ELVIS 2.0

Separate sets of instructions are provided below for UNIX, Windows-NT, and
MS-DOS.

For Win32 and MS-DOS, I've constructed batch files which, when run, cause
the programs to be compiled.  This is the preferred way to compile elvis
and its related programs.  However, you can also use MSVC++'s interactive
development environment if you prefer.  Separate instructions are given
for both compilation methods, for both operating systems.

All of these instructions assume that you have already unpacked the files
from the source code archive, "elvis-2.0.tgz".  That's a gzipped tar archive.
If you don't have the gzip and tar utilities, then the easiest way for you
to unpack them is to compile the "untar.c" program (available via anonymous
FTP from ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/elvis/unreleased/untar.c).  The files will
be placed in a subdirectory named "elvis-2.0".  The MS-DOS *.MAK files
assume that you've unpacked them while in C:\MSVC, so the files themselves
should end up in C:\MSVC\elvis-2.0.

================================================================================

UNIX
     1) Run the "configure" shell script to create "Makefile" and "config.h"
	files.  I tried to make this "configure" script work about the same
	as GNU ones.  For a complete list of options, run "configure -?"
	Here's a list of some of the more important ones, but YOU PROBABLY
	DON'T NEED TO USE ANY OF THEM because the defaults are pretty smart.
	
	    --with-x[=no]
		    This forces elvis to include support for X-windows, or
		    (with "=no") forces it not to support X-windows.  If you
		    omit this flag, configure will automatically detect
		    whether X is installed on your system, and use it if
		    available.

	    --without-x
		    This is a synonym for "--with-x=no".

	    --x-includes=directory
		    configure has a built-in list of likely places where
		    X-windows header files might be installed.  This argument
		    adds another possible location to the list.  The list is
		    used for the automatic inspection if "--with-x[=no]" was
		    omitted, and the actual directory where the files were
		    found are incorporated into the Makefile.

		    The X-windows header files are actually expected to
		    reside in a subdirectory named "X11" under the given
		    directory.  For example, if your system has a file named
		    /usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/X.h then you would give the
		    argument "--x-includes=/usr/local/X11R6/include"

	    --x-libraries=directory
		    Similarly, this adds a directory to the list of
		    directories where X-windows libraries might reside.  The
		    directory where they actually do reside is incorporated
		    into the Makefile.

	    --bindir=directory
		    This value is incorporated into the Makefile.  The
		    command "make install" will copy the executables into
		    this directory.  The default is /usr/local/bin.

	    --datadir=directory
		    This is incorporated into both the Makefile and the
		    config.h file.  It is the directory where elvis' support
		    files will reside after a "make install".  The default is
		    /usr/local/lib/elvis.

	    --libs=string
		    This option allows you to specify which library to use
		    for the "termcap" user interface.  It will usually be
		    either -ltermcap or -lcurses.

	    --ioctl=tty-style
		    There are three possibilities: termios, termio, and
		    sgtty.  These use Posix, SysV, and BSD terminal control
		    calls, respectively.  The Posix termios calls usually
		    work best.  The default is chosen by inspecting the
		    header files in /usr/include.

     2)	Give the command "make".  This should eventually produce programs
	named "elvis" and "ref".  Source code is also included for "ctags"
	and "fmt" but these aren't normally compiled because your UNIX system
	probably already has better versions of them.  If you want to use
	elvis' versions of "ctags" and "fmt" then you should edit the Makefile
	to add those programs to the definition of the ALL macro.

	Exception: Linux gets all four programs by default, because the
	versions of "ctags" and "fmt" distributed with Linux actually came
	from elvis 1.8, so the 2.0 versions are newer.

     3)	You should be able to run "elvis" in the source code directory now.
	Try "e2 README.html" or "e2 config.h".

	Note that we're running the e2 shell script instead of the elvis
	executable.  e2 simply runs elvis in such a way that it looks for
	its support files in the "lib" subdirectory, instead of the usual
	directory.

     4) If all goes well, you can install elvis by becoming the superuser and
        running the command "make install".  (Later, if you decide to uninstall
        it you can do so via the command "make uninstall".)

	 --------------------------------------------------------------------
	| NOTE: If you want to compile elvis with multiple configurations,   |
	| you should compile it with each configuration separately, and then |
	| rename the executables, and "make clean" before running the        |
	| configure script for the next configuration.  For example, to make |
	| elvis both with and without X-windows, you could...                |
	|                                                                    |
	|	configure --with-x linux                                     |
	|	make                                                         |
	|	mv elvis xelvis                                              |
	|	make clean                                                   |
	|	configure --with-x=no linux                                  |
	|	make                                                         |

MS-Windows/NT (or Windows95?), with Visual C++ 2.0 (Method #1):
     1)	Run the "makwin32.bat" file.

		makwin32

     2) You can install elvis.exe by copying it into some directory in your
	executation path, and the "lib" files into a subdirectory named "lib"
	under the directory where you installed elvis.exe.  The following
	commands are APPROXIMATELY what you need to do:

		mkdir \localbin
		copy *.exe \localbin
		path %path%;\localbin
		mkdir \localbin\lib
		copy lib\*.* \localbin\lib


MS-Windows/NT (or Windows95?), with Visual C++ 2.0 (Method #2):
     1)	Copy all of the "*.mak" files from files from the oswin32 subdirectory.

		copy oswin32\*.mak

     2)	Copy the file "osconfig.h" from the oswin32 directory to "config.h"
	(without the initial "os") in the current directory.

		copy oswin32\osconfig.h config.h

     3)	Start Visual C++ 2.0, and open the "elvis.mak" file.  Select the
	"Release" target.

     4)	Select the "Project->Build elvis.exe" menu item, and wait a while.
	Eventually this should give you an "elvis.exe" program in the
	WinRel subdirectory.  You can test this program from inside
	VC++ via the <F5> key.

     5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the "ctags.mak", "ref.mak", and "fmt.mak"
	files.

     6) You can install elvis.exe by copying it into some directory in your
	executation path, and the "lib" files into a subdirectory named "lib"
	under the execution directory.  The following commands are
	APPROXIMATELY what you need to do:

		mkdir \localbin
		copy WinRel\*.exe \localbin
		copy *.exe \localbin
		path %path%;\localbin
		mkdir \localbin\lib
		copy lib\*.* \localbin\lib

MS-DOS, using Visual C++ 1.5 (Method #1):
     REMINDER: MSVC++ 1.5 always puts the complete pathnames of all files into
	its NMAKE files.  Because of this, you *MUST* install the source code
	into a directory named "C:\MSVC\elvis-2.0".  The "elvis-2.0" component
	of that directory name is stored in the "elvis-2.0r.tgz" archive file,
	so you should be in the C:\MSVC directory when you extract the files.
	After extracting the files, do a "cd elvis-2.0"

     1) Run the "makmsdos.bat" file

		makmsdos

     2) You can install elvis by copying the *.EXE files into some directory
	in your execution path, and copying the "lib" files into a subdirectory
	named "lib" under the directory where you installed the *.EXE files.
	The following commands are APPROXIMATELY what you need to do:

		mkdir \localbin
		copy *.exe \localbin
		mkdir \localbin\lib
		copy \lib\*.* \localbin\lib
		path {OLD PATH HERE};\localbin

     1) Copy all of the "C:\MSVC\elvis-2.0\OSMSDOS\*.MAK" files into the
	"C:\MSVC\elvis-2.0" directory.

		c:
		cd \msvc\elvis-2.0
		copy osmsdos\*.mak

     2)	Copy the "\MSVC\elvis-2.0\OSMSDOS\OSCONFIG.H" file to
	"\MSVC\elvis-2.0\CONFIG.H" Note that the "OS" is dropped from the
	filename.

		copy osmsdos\osconfig.h config.h

     3) Start Visual C++ 1.5, and open the "ELVIS.MAK" project.

     4)	Select the "Project->Build ELVIS.EXE" menu item, and wait a while.
	Eventually this should give you an "ELVIS.EXE" program in the
	current directory.  You can test this program from inside VC++
