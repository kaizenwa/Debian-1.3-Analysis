* Change vc-directory so that in the CVS case
  it does `cvs status .' to get the whole directory status at once
  and then parse the output to find out about each file.

* Change the Windows NT menu code
  so that it handles the deep_p argument and avoids
  regenerating the whole menu bar menu tree except
  when the user tries to use the menubar.

  This requires the RIT to forward the WM_INITMENU message to
  the main thread, and not return from that message until the main
  thread has processed the menu_bar_activate_event and regenerated
  the whole menu bar.  In the mean time, it should process other messages.

* Put the scroll bars on the left of the windows.

* Enable use of X toolkit scroll bars.

* Put cross-references into the documentation strings.

* Implement radio buttons in menus.

* Save undo information in files, and reload it when needed
for undoing.

* Support multiple terminal-input descriptors,
and thus allow having both terminal and X frames at once.

* Implement other text formatting properties.
** Spaces of fractional width.
** Footnotes that can appear either in place
or at the end of the page.
** text property that says "don't break line in middle of this".
Don't break the line between two characters that have the
same value of this property.
** Discretionary hyphens that disappear at end of line.
** Text property for raising or lowering text.
** Text property for making text smaller or bigger by one level of size.
