GNU Service Directory
---------------------

This is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering
support services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs, for a fee
or in some cases at no charge.

The information comes from the people who asked to be listed;
we do not include any information we know to be false, but we
cannot check out any of the information; we are transmitting it to
you as it was given to us and do not promise it is correct.
Also, this is not an endorsement of the people listed here.
We have no opinions and usually no information about the abilities of
any specific person.  We provide this list to enable you to contact
service providers and decide for yourself whether to hire one.

Before FSF will list your name in the GNU Service Directory, we ask
that you agree informally to the following terms:

1. You will not restrict (except by copyleft) the use or distribution
of any software, documentation, or other information you supply anyone
in the course of modifying, extending, or supporting GNU software.
This includes any information specifically designed to ameliorate the
use of GNU software.

2. You will not take advantage of contact made through the Service
Directory to advertise an unrelated business (e.g., sales of
non-GNU-related proprietary information).  You may spontaneously
mention your availability for general consulting, but you should not
promote a specific unrelated business unless the client asks.

Please include some indication of your rates, because otherwise users
have nothing to go by.	Please put each e-mail address inside "<>".
Please put nothing else inside "<>".  Thanks!

For a current copy of this directory, or to have yourself listed, ask:

What I do:
        Primarly I work on GNU software for VMS, both VAX and AXP.  I
        also work on GNU stuff for Unix on occasion.  I'm familiar with
        SunOS (version 4.x.x), BSD (version 4.2 and up),
        Ultrix (version 4.2 and up) and Linux/Slackware.
        I've been porting GNU Emacs to VMS since spring 1991.  This
        includes versions 18.57 to 18.59 and versions 19.22 and 19.28.
        I've also ported a few other programs, most notably autoconf
        version 1.x.  Version 2.x is underway at the time of updating
        this entry.
        I maintain GNU vmslib.

Programs supported:
        GNU vmslib:     extending, installation, upgrading aid,
                        simple and complex questions, you name it.
        GNU Emacs:      porting, extending, installation, upgrading aid,
                        customization, simple or complex questions,
                        training, you name it.
        GNU autoconf:   porting, extending, installation, upgrading aid.
        GNU zip, diffutils, m4, patch, texinfo:
                        porting, installation, upgrading aid.
        GNU C/C++:      installation, upgrading aid.  I might start to
                        hack at it some day.

The list of programs I currently support represents both my interests and
current priorities.  Your interest and funding can influence my priorities.

Experience:
        Fluent in TeX/LaTeX, C, C++, Perl, Emacs Lisp, Pascal as well as
        assembler on VAX, Motorola 680x0, Intel 8086 and 80x86.  Modified
        key elements in Emacs (e.g., memory and process management) to
        work transparently on VMS.  I have very good knowledge in the VMS
        operating system, as well as MS-DOS and IBM PC compatibles.
        I'm also knowledged in the a few Unix flavors.
        I have worked for four and a half years as a VMS system manager.
        I've also provided consulting services on IBM PC compatibles,
        as well as held classes for IBM PC users.
        A reference list is available on request.

Your Rate:
        $70-$100/hour (500-800 SEK in sweden), plus expenses.  My rates
        are negotiable, depending on how interesting the project is to me.

I care more about people than I do computers.  I enjoy helping novices
learn more about free software, and I want to make free software fit
*your needs* rather than vice versa.

I am eager to help install badly-behaved source code packages, and have
experience fixing them to conform to GNU standards.

I am the maintainer of GNU dld and GNU libtool.  I am very interested in
dynamic technology, especially adaptive and highly flexible systems.

I have administered free and proprietary systems in the departments of
Civil, Electrical, and Undergraduate Engineering at the University of
Calgary.  I know how to diagnose a complex existing computer system and
incrementally replace it with a superior free system without disrupting
service.

I have over 2 years of experience with all the major free operating
systems: FreeBSD, GNU/Hurd, GNU/Linux, and NetBSD.  I also have
experience with some of the Project Athena distributed system tools:
Hesiod, Kerberos 5, Moira, and Zephyr.

I don't believe in making more money than I need.  My rates start at
$10/hr (dirt cheap).  When I am not starving, I do not charge worthy
non-profit organizations.
