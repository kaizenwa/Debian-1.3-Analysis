  "Edit a message to be sent.  Prefix arg means resume editing (don't erase).
When this function returns, the buffer `*mail*' is selected.
The value is t if the message was newly initialized; otherwise, nil.

Optionally, the signature file `mail-signature-file' can be inserted at the
end; see the variable `mail-signature'.

\\<mail-mode-map>
While editing message, type \\[mail-send-and-exit] to send the message and exit.

Various special commands starting with C-c are available in sendmail mode
to move to message header fields:
\\{mail-mode-map}

If `mail-self-blind' is non-nil, a BCC to yourself is inserted
when the message is initialized.

If `mail-default-reply-to' is non-nil, it should be an address (a string);
a Reply-to: field with that address is inserted.

If `mail-archive-file-name' is non-nil, an FCC field with that file name
is inserted.

The normal hook `mail-setup-hook' is run after the message is
initialized.  It can add more default fields to the message.

When calling from a program, the first argument if non-nil says
not to erase the existing contents of the `*mail*' buffer.

The second through fifth arguments,
 TO, SUBJECT, IN-REPLY-TO and CC, specify if non-nil
 the initial contents of those header fields.
 These arguments should not have final newlines.
The sixth argument REPLYBUFFER is a buffer whose contents
 should be yanked if the user types C-c C-y.
The seventh argument ACTIONS is a list of actions to take
 if/when the message is sent.  Each action looks like (FUNCTION . ARGS);
 when the message is sent, we apply FUNCTION to ARGS.
 This is how Rmail arranges to mark messages `answered'."
