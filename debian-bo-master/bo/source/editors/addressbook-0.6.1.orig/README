What is the actual version of Addressbook?
------------------------------------------

The actual version of Addressbook is probably 0.6 from 22.03.1996.
Look in my WWW page to find information about it and maybe a newer
version.


What is needed to run Addressbook?
----------------------------------

Addressbook is based on Tcl/Tk, so you need a machine where Tcl/Tk
is running. For most Unix like machines, Tcl/Tk is available.
This program runs as well under the old version tcl7.3/tk3.6 and the
actual version tcl7.4 / tk4.0. If you don't have tcl/tk yet, please
get the new version, as the support for tk3.6 might be removed in
future versions.

To check, if you already have Tcl/Tk, try to find 'wish', the
Tcl/Tk interpreter used. (like 'which wish' or 'type wish').
If you use Linux, the Tcl/Tk included in slackware works fine.
This program is tested under:

	- Linux 1.2.1  (i486)    Tcl7.3/Tk3.6 from Slackware 2.3
	- Linux 1.2.13 (i486)    Tcl7.4/Tk4.0 from Slackware 3.0
	- HPUX 9.0x    (HP 7xx)

It is reported to work as well under:

	- SunOS 4.x.x  (Sparc 10)
	- Solaris 2.4  (Sparc 20)
	- OSF/1 3.0    (DEC Alpha)
	- AIX 3.2      (IBM Power Risc)
	- Irix 5.3     (SGI)

Where can I get Tcl/Tk?
