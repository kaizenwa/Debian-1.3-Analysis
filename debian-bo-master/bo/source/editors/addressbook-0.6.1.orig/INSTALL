				 INSTALL

0. Requirements

To install Addressbook, you need:

- A Computer
- Tcl/Tk installed (tk3.6 or tk4.0)
- The file addressbook-[version].tar.gz

See README and ANNOUNCE where to find these things.

1. Documentation

The documentation is under development. Look at all the files in 
CAPITAL LETTERS. Or use WWW to get up to date information:

http://wwwmayr.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~durka/addressbook/index.html


2. Unpacking

Unpack the file addressbook-[version].tar.gz in your favorite place

gzip -cd addressbook-[version].tar.gz | tar xvf -


3. Testing

If you want to test it before installing, just invoke './test_addressbook'
and play with it.


4. Installing

4.1 Installation script

I have provided an installation script written in tcl. You just have
to invoke './install_addressbook' and answer the questions. If you 
want to install it as root, you have to be root while installing. 
If anything goes wrong, try to create the directories (for the binaries 
and the libdir) before starting the script. If nothing helps, you can 
always continue manually.

4.2 Manual Installation

You dont need this, if the install script finished without errors. Just
if you have problems with the automatic installation, read on.

You have to find out the location of the program 'wish' or 'wish4.0', 
the Tcl/Tk interpreter. Type something like 'where wish' or 'type wish'
or 'type wish4.0' to get the full path to it.

Replace (using your favorite editor) the first line of the file
bin/addressbook if the path to wish on your system differs.

Copy all the files in bin to /usr/local/bin, installing as root (or
to ~/bin, installing as user)

cp -d bin/* /usr/local/bin

Make a directory /usr/local/lib/addressbook (or ~/addressbook)
if you choose an other place, modify the variable 'configfile' in
addressbook (about line 4)

Copy all the files in lib (incl. subdirs) to /usr/local/lib/addressbook

cp -dR lib/* /usr/local/lib/addressbook

Edit (using your favorite editor) the file 
/usr/local/lib/addressbook/addressbook.config to meet your local needs.


4.3. The little programs tel fax and email

These programs are written in perl and they are standalone programs to
get the telephone number in a fast way. They get installed by the installation
program.

5. Using

To use, just call addressbook. You will get the default addressfile.
If you want to create your own file, copy the formatfile from the
default addressfile (/usr/local/lib/addressbook/addresses.dat.fmt)
and modify it.

Note: Each data file needs a format file with the same name plus
the extension .fmt

If you allow users to modify the global addressfile, you have to give
them write access to the file. If not, every user should have a file
.addressbook.config in his homedirectory pointing to his addressfile.

With the file ~/.addressbook.config you can override the defaults.

It is very handy to have a adrfile1 and adrfile2 defined in the global
or privat config file, than you can switch easily between these two files
for example for the global and personal addressbookfile.

For the little programs, just invoke tel, email or fax with the name, 
you want to search as an argument.


6. Registration

Don't be shocked, the program is published under the GNU Public
Licence (see COPYING). However, if you like the program and you 
use it regularly, it would be nice, if you would send me a short
email, where you write what you like, what suggestions you have,
how you were informed about the existence of this program,
how many users use it and if you want to be notified, if a new 
version comes out. This registration doesn't cost anything, I 
will not use your email address for any purpose, unless you want to
be notified of new versions. This registration helps me to track down 
the number of people who use it, the problems and the important
things who need to be developed more.

For a registation form, please look at the file REGISTRATION.


7. Problems

If you have problems, please contact the me.
As I'm continuing the development, I welcome any questions, comments, 
suggestions, complaints, assistance, money, CDROMs and virtual beer.
