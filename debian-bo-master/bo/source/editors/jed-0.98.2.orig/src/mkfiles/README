The *only* makefile here that I will continue to support is
makefile.all.  It is used in conjunction with the DOS executable
`mkmake.exe' to produce other makefiles.

To produce makefiles for, e.g., BCC, use the command

      mkmake BCC < makefile.all > makefile
      
Similarly, other makefiles may be produced as

      mkmake DJGPP FOLD  < makefile.all > makefile
      mkmake WIN95 FOLD  < makefile.all > makefile
      mkmake OS2EMX FOLD  < makefile.all > makefile
      mkmake MSWIN  < makefile.all > makefile

  (For FOLDing support, you also have to edit features.h)

If you want to submit a makefile to me, please make additions to
makefile.all.

Note: I have only tested makefiles for bcc, djgpp, and mswin
makefiles.  It is conceivable that makefile.all may need modifed for
other systems.

Thanks,
