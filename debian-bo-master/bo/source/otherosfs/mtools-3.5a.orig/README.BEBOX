REFER TO README.


This is mtools 3.3, which now also works on BeOS, and can be used as a
replacement for the version 2.0.7 mtools supplied with BeOS.
mtools 3.3 supports the VFAT filesystem (long filenames), which the
Be-supplied tools do not.
mtools 3.0 has been reported to work with ZIP drives, so I suppose
they'll work with mtools 3.3 as well.
IDE harddisks are not supported (on BeOS), because of byte-order problems.
If a ZIP works, SCSI harddisks will probably work, though.

To install:

- build the executables: type "make -f Makefile.Be" in the mtools
  directory. Again, this instruction is only for the Bebox, not for any
  kind of Unix. They should compile without any warnings or errors.  The
  linking stage will give two warnings about ignoring strcasecmp and
  strncasecmp in libbe.so. This is OK, since we're using the
  replacements that come with mtools.

  WARNING: do NOT rerun the configure script. GNU autoconf scripts tend
  to lock up Be's crummy port of bash. I have hand-crafted a config.h
  that can be used to compile mtools. This will be used if you just type
  "make -f Makefile.Be"

- copy the "mtools" executable (and perhaps also "mkmanifest") to /bin,
  or to another directory in your path.

- add the following lines to the file /boot/.profile
  NOTE: previous versions of this readme file contained some errors
  in the aliases definition. The ones below are correct, and contain
  a few new ones.

alias mattrib="mtools -c mattrib"
alias mbadblocks="mtools -c mbadblocks"
alias mcd="mtools -c mcd"
alias mcopy="mtools -c mcopy"
alias mdel="mtools -c mdel"
alias mdeltree="mtools -c mdeltree"
alias mdir="mtools -c mdir"
alias mformat="mtools -c mformat"
alias minfo="mtools -c minfo"
alias mlabel="mtools -c mlabel"
alias mmd="mtools -c mmd"
alias mmount="mtools -c mmount"
alias mrd="mtools -c mrd"
alias mread="mtools -c mread"
alias mmove="mtools -c mmove"
alias mpartition="mtools -c mpartition"
alias mren="mtools -c mren"
alias mtoolstest="mtools -c mtoolstest"
alias mtest="mtools -c  mtest"
alias mtype="mtools -c mtype"
alias mwrite="mtools -c mwrite"
alias mzip="mtools -c mzip"

 (then close and re-open all terminals and shells, or type
  ". /boot/.profile" in each open terminal to activate the aliases.)

Alternatively, make multiple copies of the "mtools" executable and use
the names mdir, mdel etcetera.
If the version of BeOS you are working with supports links, then simply
link mtools to mdir, mcopy and so on.

- if you want more than just floppy support, you need to make a configuration
  file. An example mtools.conf.be is included in the distribution.
  You can either rename it to /boot/.mtoolsrc, or you can define the environment
  variable MTOOLSRC and give the config file any name you like and put it at any
  location.
  You need to add something like export MTOOLSRC=/boot/system/mtools.conf to
  your .profile file.
  Take care to remove or change the entries that you don't need. The provided
  mtools.conf is for unix systems, with some BeOS settings at the end.
  The sample entry for a ZIP disk on the BeOS has been provided by Chris Herborth
  (chrish@qnx.com). 

- optional: remove the old mtools from the /bin directory

- enjoy!
