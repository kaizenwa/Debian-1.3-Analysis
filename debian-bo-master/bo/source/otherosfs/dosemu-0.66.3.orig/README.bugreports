Featured in this release is an automatic BUG Reporting system.

Simply run ./submit-bug-report and fill in as much information as you 
can about the bug. The system will automatically make copies of your
/etc/dosemu.conf and your .dosrc (if you have one). It also allows you
to include a file containing debug information.

Please try to fill in as much detail as possible and select a suitable 
category as this will help us to trace and deal with the bug quickly.

The default action is to save the report in a file which you can then
send later or from another machine.[1] If you have a direct internet 
connection then the bug report can be sent straight away if you set 
the 'Report Action' to 'email'. 

You should recieve a response within about 24hrs confirming that the 
bug report has been recieved and details of who is tracking the bug.
You will also be notified of our progress.

If you have any problems then please get in touch!

[1] You will probably need to edit the file before you can send it. 
Please try and preserver the headers as they are important. If you 
have access to another unix system then the best method for sending 
the file is to feed the file to '/usr/lib/sendmail -t'.
