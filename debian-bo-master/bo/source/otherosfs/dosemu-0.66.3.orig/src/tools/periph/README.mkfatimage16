I have also attached (gzipped in MIME format) mkfatimage16.c, a modified
version of mkfatimage which takes an additional switch [-t
number_of_tracks] and automatically switches to the 16-bit FAT format if
the specified size is >16MB.  I have deleted the "real" DOS partition from
my disk, and so I am now running an entirely "virtual" DOS system within a
big hdimage!
