The Following items are used to delimit the text used to create this file.
Whilst it is not necessary to know this, they are included because they may
be useful for searching, as they are (at least at the moment) reasonably 
unique.

DANG_BEGIN_MODULE / DANG_END_MODULE
	This will bracket a description of the file (normally at the
	start).

DANG_BEGIN_FUNCTION / DANG_END_FUNCTION
	This brackets a description of functions (good this, isn't it!)
	Not every function needs to be described in this way - just the
	major ones.

DANG_BEGIN_REMARK / DANG_END_REMARK
	This brackets descriptions of obscure items, like data structures
	and architecture.

DANG_FIXTHIS
	This is a one line item, indicating a an area requiring a fix, or
	redesign.

DANG_BEGIN_NEWIDEA / DANG_END_NEWIDEA
	New Ideas Start Here! As Ideas are proposed, that get added with 
	their description, so that future generations can laugh at or
	code the ideas ..... These bracket the idea description.

DANG_BEGIN_CHANGELOG / DANG_END_CHANGELOG
	Changelogs - very useful for bug fixing, and avvailable for use
	with DPR (or that's the theory)
