<date> Mar 21, 1997 for dosemu 0.66.0 (and possibly earlier versions)

<abstract>
This file list programs and groups of programms not running or running
only partial under dosemu.

Please report about possible additions to

</bf>. Perhaps it can be made going
with the help others. Have a look at the dosemu-howto how to do so.

<toc>

<sect>Fundamental problem
<p>Programs that don't work under the MSDOS Emulator and probably
won't ever work, because of fundamental problem. Some of these
fundamental problems result in these programs not being runnable on
Win3.x/Win95/WinNT in a Dosbox and under OS/2 either. These programs
are characterized by using any of these features:

<sect1>Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI)
<p>VCPI allows programs to run in ring 0. This is kernel mode in Linux
and not sensible.

Example: sim2181.exe from Analog Devices DSP Kit

<sect1>Programs using older Versions of the Pharlap Extender 
<p>The Pharlap Extender in it's older versions needed ring 0 access
too, so it can't me made working in the emulator.

Example:Autocad Version 12c1 For DOS

<sect1>MSDOS enhanced mode Windows kernel krnl386.exe
<p> krnl386.exe needs Ring 0 access too. 

<sect1>Windows programs using Win32s
<p>Win32s needs Ring 0 access too. 

<sect1>Does my failing program belong to these groups?
<p>Check with "strings &lt;program.exe&gt; | less" if the programm
contains some of these keywords <bf> vcpi, pharlap and win32s</bf>. Newer
Pharlap programs may work.

<sect>Known bugs

<sect1>Things YOU may help changing

<p>This is a list of currently known bugs in Dosemu0.53pl58, currently
in the process of adaptation to 0.66.0

- Some documentation is known to be well out of date. 

- Some video BIOS will start very slowly with the serial ports enabled.

- If you are having troubles with EMS, try moving your page frame or
  disabling umb_max if it is set to 'on'.

- Programs (like MFT.EXE from QEMM) may crash due to inadequate timer
  resolution. A fast machine will have less problems

- Quattro Pro for DOS is rumored not to work (anyone with a copy willing to
  look into why?)

- Windows 3.1 will not run very well.  We do NOT recommend running it.

- There may be periodic "internal stack overflows" using the mouse,
  especially under Windows (correct, all?)

<sect1> Problems probably solved
<p>Here reported problems with older versions are listed. The current version
should have solved them, but this has to be validated. Please report if you
had problems in the listed areas and these problems are now solved. 

- If you seem to be getting corrupt files, try switching away from Linux
  v1.1.50-v1.1.65, since there are known disk access bugs.

- DPMI emulation is known to be somewhat buggy.

- There are known problems with xdos (e.g. it may not work at all for you.)

- xdos sessions accessed from remote, non-Linux X-sessions (e.g. SUN stations
  and others) may not work correctly.

- The internal mouse driver is known to have problems.

- Running a protected mode 'make' and a protected mode compiler (e.g.
  Borland's) may not work.  Try switching to a real mode make.
<!-- Can anybody validate? -->

<sect>Programs not working yet
<p>Here are programs listed, where someone has reported that it does
not work.

<sect1>dd2demo.exe
<p> This is a game found at 
<tscreen>
      <htmlurl url="http://www.psygnosis.com/"
      name="http://www.psygnosis.com/">
</tscreen>
Reported by Hans Lermen, it kills dosemu, giving an output like:
<tscreen>
	general protection at 0x1fba: a7
	ERROR: SIGSEGV, protected insn...exiting!
</tscreen>
The crash happens in DMPI Call 0x0302
At least DMPI Call 0x0506 is not yet implemented.

<sect1>bae.exe
<p>This is a demo version of an Electronic CAD programm, found at
<tscreen>
      <htmlurl url="http://www.bartels.de/"
      name="http://www.bartels.de/">
</tscreen>
Reported by Uwe Bonnes, it stops dosemu with a blank screen in an
unusable state. You have to do a remote login to kill dosemu, or hit
reset with all it's possible fatal result. The possible reason is the
missing implementation of DMPI Call 0x0800, as Uwe Bonnes reported it
once working on the console with some hack.

<sect1>tasmx.exe 
<p>Reported by alberto.vignani@torino.alpcom.it (Alberto Vignani):
Protected-mode version of the Borland Turbo Assembler. It crashes with
"out of memory" at startup. I traced it at the assembly level, no result
until now. Maybe a DPMI problem (97/03/04).

<sect1>xaos.exe
<p>Reported by alberto.vignani@torino.alpcom.it (Alberto Vignani):
Mandelbrot zoomer, version 2.2 under djgpp, using Allegro 2.1 library.
Can be found on any simtelnet mirror (xaos22b.exe?)
Any mouse movement (in console mode with a button pressed) crashes it
(97/03/04).

<sect1>QIC tape programs
<p>Reported by alberto.vignani@torino.alpcom.it (Alberto Vignani):
Tape is not supported. Worse, if you use a floppy under dosemu, you
have sometimes to remove/reinstall the ftape module.

<sect1> Any program using SCSI
<p>Reported by alberto.vignani@torino.alpcom.it (Alberto Vignani):

No ASPI support until now(97/03/04).
