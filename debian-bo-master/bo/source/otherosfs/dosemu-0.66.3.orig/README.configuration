This release includes the new configuration routines. Running './setup-dosemu'
from this directory will allow you to configure both the compilation and
the run-time aspects of DOSEmu. When changing the run-time settings of
DOSEmu you can set both the system wide settings and your personal settings.
Even better, the program will automatically tell you your current settings
or suggest defaults where possible.


The program uses a modified 'lxdialog' (which is in fact a stolen 'dialog')
from the Linux-kernel (/usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog). This is compiled
before usage. If this compilation fails (e.g. when you have no 'ncurses'),
it will use 'dialog' which is supplied with all major distributions.
