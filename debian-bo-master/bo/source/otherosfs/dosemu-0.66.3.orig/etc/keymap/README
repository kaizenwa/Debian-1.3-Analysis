		This keymap is for using dosemu over telnet, and
having *all* your keys work.  This keymap is not complete.  But
hopefully with everyones help it will be someday :)


		There are a couple of things that are intentionally
broken with this keymap, most noteably F11 and F12.  This is because
they are not working though slang correctly at the current instant.
I have them mapped to "greyplus" and "greyminus".  Also the scroll
lock is mapped to shift-f3.  This is because the scroll lock dosn't
work right at all.  Please feel free to send keymap patches in that
fix anything but these.

If you want to patch *dosemu* to fix either of those problems, i'd be
*glad* to accept those :)

to figure out how to edit this, read the keystroke-howto.

as of 3/30/95, control/shift/alternate
home/insert/delete/end/pageup/pagedown should work.  

Major issues will be:

Do we move "alt-<fkey>" to "control-<fkey>" to switch virtual
consoles?

who is going to fix the linux keyboard device to be able to handle
multiple keymaps at the same time?

--------------------------------------------------------

to use it:

as root type

	loadkeys dosemu.new.keymap

(then run dosemu via telnet, or something in slang mode)


when your done, find your old keymap, and load it back, cause
controll-home won't work in emacs anymore (or any other special key in
any applicaion that uses xlate)



if you find a key missing, please add it and send me the patch.  (test
it first! :)

if you find a key missing, and don't feel like coding it, *don't tell
me*!  I already know that there are a lot of keys missing.
