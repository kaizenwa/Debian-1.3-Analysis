  Programs that don't work under the MSDOS Emulator and probably won't
  ever work, because of fundamental problem. Some of these fundamental
  problems result in these programs not being runnable on
  Win3.x/Win95/WinNT in a Dosbox and under OS/2 either. These programs
  are characterized by using any of these features:

  11..11..  VViirrttuuaall CCoonnttrrooll PPrrooggrraamm IInntteerrffaaccee ((VVCCPPII))

  VCPI allows programs to run in ring 0. This is kernel mode in Linux
  and not sensible.

  Example: sim2181.exe from Analog Devices DSP Kit

  11..22..  PPrrooggrraammss uussiinngg oollddeerr VVeerrssiioonnss ooff tthhee PPhhaarrllaapp EExxtteennddeerr

  The Pharlap Extender in it's older versions needed ring 0 access too,
  so it can't me made working in the emulator.

  Example:Autocad Version 12c1 For DOS

  krnl386.exe needs Ring 0 access too.

  Win32s needs Ring 0 access too.

  Check with "strings <program.exe> | less" if the programm contains
  some of these keywords  vvccppii,, pphhaarrllaapp aanndd wwiinn3322ss. Newer Pharlap

  This is a list of currently known bugs in Dosemu0.53pl58, currently in
  the process of adaptation to 0.66.0

  - Some documentation is known to be well out of date.

  - Some video BIOS will start very slowly with the serial ports
  enabled.

  - If you are having troubles with EMS, try moving your page frame or
  disabling umb_max if it is set to 'on'.

  - Programs (like MFT.EXE from QEMM) may crash due to inadequate timer
  resolution. A fast machine will have less problems

  - Quattro Pro for DOS is rumored not to work (anyone with a copy
  willing to look into why?)

  - Windows 3.1 will not run very well.  We do NOT recommend running it.

  - There may be periodic "internal stack overflows" using the mouse,
  especially under Windows (correct, all?)

  22..22..  PPrroobblleemmss pprroobbaabbllyy ssoollvveedd

  Here reported problems with older versions are listed. The current
  version should have solved them, but this has to be validated. Please
  report if you had problems in the listed areas and these problems are
  now solved.

  - If you seem to be getting corrupt files, try switching away from
  Linux v1.1.50-v1.1.65, since there are known disk access bugs.

  - DPMI emulation is known to be somewhat buggy.

  - There are known problems with xdos (e.g. it may not work at all for
  you.)
  - xdos sessions accessed from remote, non-Linux X-sessions (e.g. SUN
  stations and others) may not work correctly.

  - The internal mouse driver is known to have problems.

  - Running a protected mode 'make' and a protected mode compiler (e.g.
  Borland's) may not work.  Try switching to a real mode make.

  Here are programs listed, where someone has reported that it does not
  work.

  33..11..  dddd22ddeemmoo..eexxee

  This is a game found at

       http://www.psygnosis.com/

  Reported by Hans Lermen, it kills dosemu, giving an output like:

       general protection at 0x1fba: a7 ERROR: SIGSEGV, protected
       insn...exiting!

  The crash happens in DMPI Call 0x0302 At least DMPI Call 0x0506 is not
  yet implemented.

  33..22..  bbaaee..eexxee

  This is a demo version of an Electronic CAD programm, found at

       http://www.bartels.de/

  Reported by Uwe Bonnes, it stops dosemu with a blank screen in an
  unusable state. You have to do a remote login to kill dosemu, or hit
  reset with all it's possible fatal result. The possible reason is the
  missing implementation of DMPI Call 0x0800, as Uwe Bonnes reported it
  once working on the console with some hack.

  33..33..  ttaassmmxx..eexxee

  Reported by alberto.vignani@torino.alpcom.it (Alberto Vignani):
  Protected-mode version of the Borland Turbo Assembler. It crashes with
  "out of memory" at startup. I traced it at the assembly level, no
  result until now. Maybe a DPMI problem (97/03/04).

  33..44..  xxaaooss..eexxee

  Reported by alberto.vignani@torino.alpcom.it (Alberto Vignani):
  Mandelbrot zoomer, version 2.2 under djgpp, using Allegro 2.1 library.
  Can be found on any simtelnet mirror (xaos22b.exe?)  Any mouse
  movement (in console mode with a button pressed) crashes it
  (97/03/04).

  33..55..  QQIICC ttaappee pprrooggrraammss

  Reported by alberto.vignani@torino.alpcom.it (Alberto Vignani): Tape
  is not supported. Worse, if you use a floppy under dosemu, you have
  sometimes to remove/reinstall the ftape module.

  33..66..  AAnnyy pprrooggrraamm uussiinngg SSCCSSII

  Reported by alberto.vignani@torino.alpcom.it (Alberto Vignani):

  No ASPI support until now(97/03/04).
