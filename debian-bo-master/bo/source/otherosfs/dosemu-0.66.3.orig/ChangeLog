97/04/20 ver. 0.66.3 released
	From Hans
	- new hdimage generation stuff, need mtools-3.6:
	  ./setup-hdimage makes a bootable hdimage from the DOS the user
		has already installed under native DOS
		I tried this with the following OSes:
		FreeDos, MSDOS-6.2, WINDOWS'95.
		Other DOSes should also work, when the names of the
		system files are given on prompt.
		(Next step will be to automatically transform the
		 config.sys and autoexec.bat ;-)
	  ./dexe/mkdexe generates a direct executable DOS-app (hdimage
		containing just one app). The extension is *.dexe
	  ./dexe/dosexec executes a *.dexe
	  ./dexe/do_mtools symplifies the access to a hdimage
	  ./dexe/extract-dos takes the bootsector and the system files
		out of a dos partition or a hdimage
	  All this stuff is described in ./doc/README.dexe and the
	  Quickstart.
97/04/17 ver. 0.66.2.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- fix for INT8 rescheduled to fast in DPMI
	From Hans
	- new dosdebug commands: 'log' and 'dump'
	  With 'log' you can change/display the debug-logging flags such as
	  'log +M-k' on the fly within dosdebug.
	  With 'dump' you may write any piece of allowed dosemu mem to
	  a file, such as 'dump cs:100 1234 /dosc/xxx.com'
	  (wishes from Grant R. Guenther, the great parallel ZIP hacker ;-)
97/04/16 ver. 0.66.2.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- 'keystroke' feature now also available for new-kbd
	From Alberto
	- fix for src/base/misc/priv.c (forgotten return)
97/04/12 ver. 0.66.2 released
	From Alberto
	- minimal patch needed to fix the mode-0 timer bug for
	  MONOTON_MICRO_TIMING
	From Hans
	- added direct bootable 'tiny' FreeDos etc/hdimage.test.
	  This can be started via ./first-test. For more have a look
	  at ./Quickstart and ./contrib/dosC/readme.dosemu.
	- Added option -b to src/tools/periph/mkfatimage16.c in order
	  to allow inserting the FreeDos bootsector.
	- fixed a remaining security hole:
	  'secure' was off by default and when a user uses -F it
	  was left 'off' :-(
	- udapted docs.
97/04/09 ver. 0.66.1.5 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- added 'keystroke' feature, you may now feed DOSEMU with key
	  strokes, that are automagically typed in as if from the keyboard.
            dos -D-a -I 'keystroke "\F8;\p200;6"
          Will press F8, then wait 2 seconds, then type 6.
	  For more details see etc/config.dist and doc//README.batch
	From Marty
	- use gawk instead of awk in setup stuff, else 'next' isn't supported.
	  ( gnats report misc/13 )
97/04/04 ver. 0.66.1.4 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- complete rework of the privs stuff, now we _really_ can
	  run as user, and this is now the default!
	  (note: run as user means that dosemu mostly has user privs)
	  For more details see ./doc/README.runasuser and
	  src/base/misc/README.privs
	- updated the docs concernig 'run as user' and new privs stuff
	- Fixed some warnings in lexer.l and parser.y
97/04/04 ver. 0.66.1.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- (hopefully) final fix for >2G over mfs.
	From Marty
	- search for slang.h in /usr/local/include
	From Hans
	- fixed gnats report memory/10
	  (rep. by David E. Kingsley <camel@hysteria.crisis.net>)
	  set XMS_DRIVER_VERSION to 0x0301
97/04/04 ver. 0.66.1.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Uwe
	- cleaned up keyb_layout presetting in src/base/init/parser.y
	- defaulting to KEYB_US now, when under X and _no_ X_keycode
	From Marky (hi;-)
	- changed his non-working mail addresses
97/04/04 ver. 0.66.1.1 unofficial pre-release
        From Hans
	- added a DOSEMU-special MBR to hdimage.
	  This is the world premiere of MBR running in 32-bit protected mode;-)
	  ( no need to use 'fdisk /MBR' any more )
97/03/28 ver. 0.66.1 released
	From Hans
	- added a new commandline option: -I
	  Wow, is that powerfull!! ;-) It makes a lot of people happy
	  that complained about inflexible configuration (for a more
	  detailed description read man/dos.1). It makes the following
	  (and much more) possible:
		dos ... -I 'video { mda }'
		dos ... -I "`cat my_other_dosemu.conf`"
		dos ... -I "`my_special_config_script.sh`"
          hmm... waiting for people reporting it has security issues ;-)
          (but you before report them: -I runs under the same secure level
           as .dosrc)
	- fixed a security hole: user could disable 'secure on' :-(
	- updated the docs
	From Alistair
	- fixed gnats report misc/9 (rep. by mharris@blackwidow.saultc.on.ca)
	  (error while running setup-dosemu)
97/03/27 ver. 0.66.0.4 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- made sound a disable option in /etc/dosemu.conf ('sound_emu off')
	  (else it may clobber an IRQ, if configured but not used)
	From Philip.Blundell@pobox.com
	- some compile fixes for glibc
97/03/27 ver. 0.66.0.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Bart Hartgers <barth@stack.nl>
	- Made dosnet.c running under 2.0.x kernel (was broken)
	From Hans
	- again fixes to ./configure & slang.h :(
97/03/26 ver. 0.66.0.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Soos Peter <sp@osb.hu>
	- added support for hungarian keyboard
	From Hans
	- fixed gnats report misc/8 (rep. by Ambrose Li)
	  In configure, if 'no X' the XINCLUDES was preset with a comment
	  (what joker invented that?) such as "# no special path needed".
	  This made the following -I...slang.h invisible in INCDIR.
97/03/26 ver. 0.66.0.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans Zoebelein <zocki@goldfish.cube.net>
	- fix for error printout, when reading a write protected floppy.
	From Steffen
	- fix typo in priv_drop()
	From Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl
	- fix for ./configure to detect slang.h correctly
	- making rm -f `find ...` not complaining, when nothing found
	- small 'warning avoid' in src/emu-i386/portss.c
	From Hans
	- fix for gnats report misc/4
	  When no XINCLUDES is set, it left a stale '-I'
	- fix wrong gcc check in ./configure (reported by Jeff Epler)
	  checking now for $GCC=yes
97/03/21 ver. 0.66.0 released
	From Hans
	- fix to ./configure, -without-x gots messed up in 0.65.99.23
	- Docs update

--------

97/03/20 ver. 0.65.99.26 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- DANG cleanup, added DANG-compiler
	- recompiled DANG.sgml --> DANG.txt (-- Hans)
97/03/20 ver. 0.65.99.25 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair & Rutger
        - For 0.66 we have updated many areas and re-organised others to
	  make it easier to maintain.
          Many thanks to David Brauman <crisk@netvision.net.il> for finding so
          many bugs
	- new sound stuff. 'midid' reworked,
          goes into directory src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid
	  Compile it with 'make midid'
	- Added in support for the handler to reject the completion.
97/03/19 ver. 0.65.99.24 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- fix for 'partitions >500M' part 2 (wrong sector rounding)
	- Fixes and correcter calculations for config.freq, which can
	  be set in dosemu.conf to adjust what dosemu takes for a second.
	  (units in DOS timer clocks, 18 make one second). TIMER_DIVISOR
	  is the constant (6) to make one Unix-tick (at 100Hz) out of the
	  DOS-ticker.
97/03/17 ver. 0.65.99.23 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- new targets in main Makfile: docs, docsinstall, docsclean
	From Pavel Kankovsky <kan@dcit.cz>
	- fixes for X-detection
	From Steffen (realized by Hans;)
	- emulate a down counting 'diskette motor timeout'
	  old games seem to rely on that.
	From Alberto:
	- small mouse fix (320x200)
	- discovered that int2f,ax=110c fails for partitions >500M, because
	  it can't set cluster size>8. Here is my fix, which should also avoid
	  overflows on >2G disks.
97/03/16 ver. 0.65.99.22 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- docs move around:
	  all doc source go into src/doc/DANG, src/doc/HOWTO
          made Makfiles to generate 'nice' docs.
          You have to 'cd src/doc' then do 'make'
          To install the *.txt into ./doc type 'make install'
	NOTE: the patch to this release is a patch-*.tgz, what means,
              you have have to un-tar it into the ./dosmemu directory and then
              type 'sh tmp/do_patch'.
	      This will _first_ move the files, and then apply the patch.
97/03/15 ver. 0.65.99.21 unofficial pre-release
	From Uwe
	- take version date out of ./Changelog
	From Alberto
	- 'make pristine' removes 'gen.log'
	From Alstair and Rutger
	- new sound stuff
97/03/14 ver. 0.65.99.20 unofficial pre-release
	=== CLEANUP-Release ===
	From Hans
	- first round 'JES --> Hans' doc changes
	- new README.batch
	- preparation for 0.66 (version changes in docs)
	- check DPR a bit, but the rest is to Alistair ;-)
	- removed all RCS headers (not using any more)
	- well, and found that compiling without VM86PLUS was broken,
	  fixed it in parser.y
	From Alberto
	- lots of typos fixed (collected cleanups)
	- some more debug prints in pic.c
97/03/14 ver. 0.65.99.19 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- 1st arg of log_printf becomes 'int'
	- (some) fix for the inte6 problem (80x50)
	- missing HLT_OFF in DPMI 'free realmode call back address' (0x0304)
	- Without this CDs can't be changed:
	  force media_changed, when ejecting (src/dosext/drivers/cdrom.c),
	  _realy_ do CDROMRESET in cdrom_reset()
97/03/12 ver. 0.65.99.18 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- Further gnats enhancements
	From Hans
	- Because 'midi' always was created in the default directory (which
	  also is the name of the 'midi' executable ;-) ), I
	  renamed the 'midi' file to /var/run/dosemu-midi, removed the
          'create' on open and checked for 'is open' when writeing to it.
	  Updated README.sound accordingly.
	From Uwe
	- second try (;-) to make compiling on NFS mounted directory
          possible
97/03/11 ver. 0.65.99.17 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- deleted 'rm modules' in src/arch/linux/Makefile.main.in
	  (obsolete)
	- fixed 'regs' parsing in dosdebugger.
	- banner now prints correct time
	- fixed relocation of INT42 (must be a copy of INT10)
	- call setmode() of video driver only if pointer valid (int10.c)
	- disable -Y -Z, when X not configured.
	- some 'close mouse' fixes
	- temp fix to dpmi.c int31 just to avoid hard reboots
	- fix for auto-mitshm-disable stuff in X.c
	- corrected wrong (port,value) parameters in s3.c
	- do not debug while VC is not active (in src/env/video/vc.c)
	- removed some stale files
	- avoid pktdrvr.h to be multiple included
	From Hans
	- removed stale references to emusys.h
	- elaborated the description of the 'ttylocks {}' option in
	  etc/config.dist.
97/03/08 ver. 0.65.99.16 unofficial pre-release
	From Steffen
	- Added code to turn off MIT-SHM for network connections.
	From Uwe
	- small additional debug out for DPMI
97/03/07 ver. 0.65.99.15 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- cleanup for CFLAGS in configure(.in)
	- corrections in etc/config.dist
	- missing exception 16 handling in src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c
	- various fixes in src/base/async/int.c, temp fix for Ctrl-C bug
	  in Djgpp (int 23 revectored and caputered).
	- changed 0/1 to REVECT/NO_REVECT
	- cleanup of usage message in src/base/init/config.c
	  and fix wrong cardtype number
	- fixes to buffered debug out (log_printf).
	- mouse fix (serial/int14.c)
	- fixed 'hlt' optimization in run_dpmi()
	- cleaned up 'case 1..2:' to 'case 1: case 2:' in various places
	- in_dos_21 warnings fixed
	- some mfs fixes.
	From Thomas Winder <thomas.winder@sea.ericsson.se>
	- struct sigaction fixes for glibc-2 in src/arch/linux/async/signal.c
	From Hans
	- fix for default-configure
	- made 'irqpassing' a synonym for 'sillyint', because users
	  apparently get confused. Also adapted config.dist
97/03/07 ver. 0.65.99.14 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Fix for the mouse garrot helper: using INT28_IDLE_USECS
	- fix for non compileing new kbd (unintentionally reverse patch
	  at state of 0.65.99.4 in conjunction with priv_* cleanup)
	- remove src/dosext/dpmi/kernel.diffs (obsolete)
	- remove src/Configure (broken, obsoleted by Alistairs stuff)
	- added rebuild script
	From Hans
	- added ./set-permissions, which sets all exec-bits for all scripts
	  (so when upgrading per patch, this scripts gets it right)
	- added ./default-configure, this script should be used instead
	  of ./configure, because it interpretes the compiletime-settings
	  which can be changed by Alistairs setup-dosemu stuff.
	- changed setup/compiletime_setup.sh so it uses ./default-configure
	  to interprete the various menu variables (have now only one place
          to take care of it;-)
97/03/07 ver. 0.65.99.13 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- fixes for setup & gnats
	  (Yeah, now it works fine; and Alistair has time for his sound ;-)
	From Hans
	- send-pr gets dosemu-version out of ./configure.in
	- stole lxdialog, named it 'demudialog' and adapted setup gnats
	  to use that. (normal dialog shows a strange handling, when used
	  for Alistairs stuff)
	  I hope Alistair will enhance 'demudialog' to fit our needs
	  again better ;-)
97/02/29 ver. 0.65.99.12 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- setup stuff from 0.65
	- gnats stuff from 0.65
	From Uwe
	- New dosemu-HOWTO.*, EMUfailure.txt
	  (deleted EMUsuccess.txt)
97/02/29 ver. 0.65.99.11 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Fixes for 'unix.com'
	- little PIC fix: maybe it is better not to blindly decrement timer
	  values if they are set to NEVER.
97/02/28 ver. 0.65.99.10 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Use a big buffer for debug messages, this doesn't slow down
	  dosemu, when debugging.
	From Hans
	- Made the above 'big buffer' an item in /etc/dosemu.conf:
          'logbufsize <SIZE>', default is _no_ buffering.
	- Fixed ./configure.in, so it now doesn't use -fomit-frame-pointer
	  when configured for debugging.
97/02/27 ver. 0.65.99.9 unofficial pre-release
	From Adrian Sun <asun@zoology.washington.edu>
	- Make dosemu compile under glibc 2.0.1
	- Small IPX bug fix: have the initfile.c functions return on a failed
	  open. Workaround for missing IPX_TYPE = 1 in glibc headers.
	- convert a missed SignalHander -> __sighandler_t
97/02/27 ver. 0.65.99.8 unofficial pre-release
	From Uwe:
	- base/misc/disks.c, include/disks.h, tools/periph/hdinfo.c
	  Use llseek on Linux to allow access on Files greater 2.1 GBytes
	- made 'make install' on NFS mounted FS possible
	  (compiling as user, installing as root)
97/02/27 ver. 0.65.99.7 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Fix for debugger, recent 'nm' has 16 hexdigits for addesses
	From Hans
	- made the path of dosemu.map defineable in /etc/dosemu.conf:
	  'dosemumap <STRING>'
97/02/25 ver. 0.65.99.6 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto & Hans
	- workaround for bug in kernel vm86plus that Alberto found
          (fixing kernel patch did reach Linus already;-)
          We will remove the workaround when time goes by
	- added runtime kernel version check ( currently only used
	  by the above workaround)
97/02/23 ver. 0.65.99.5 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair & Rutger
	- Updated SB DSP code and fixed some bugs in detection - Alistair
	- Re-hacked ports.c so the DMA code works again. GRRRRR - Alistair
	- Added first pass at MPU-401 code - Rutger
97/02/22 ver. 0.65.99.4 unofficial pre-release
	From Eric Biederman <ebiederm@cse.unl.edu>
	- priv_on/off/default cleanup
97/02/21 ver. 0.65.99.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Support for CIRRUS chipsets (some code comon with S3: v_8514)
	From Hans
	- fixed typos (mine) for ATI: in Makefile.in and lexer.l
97/02/20 ver. 0.65.99.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Josef Pavlik <jetset@ibm.net>
	- Added ATI support (untested --Hans)
	  This patch is for VGA ATI Mach 64 (probably will work with Mach8
	  and Mach32 too).  Set "video { vga console graphics chipset ati }"
	  in dosemu.conf. Resolves problem with ioports >0x3ff and saves
	  registers which contains clock speed. Without this patch dosemu
	  changes clock speed of VGA.
97/02/20 ver. 0.65.99.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Fix PIC bug (replacment for old ALBERTO_KLUDGE)
	From Hans
	- fixed a small typo (yes, it was mine),
	  ( did use close(f) instead of fclose(f) :((  )
97/02/17 ver. 0.65.99 unofficial pre-release,
			 first round targeting 0.66, 0.67
	From Hans
	- Collected the keyboard patches from 0.63.1.56 .. 0.63.1.98
	  ( from Rainer Zimmermann <zimmerm@mathematik.uni-marburg.de> )
	  and adapted them on top of 0.64.4.
	  Fixed some bugs (which very likely also bothered 0.65.0),
	  added the recent Slang and codetable changes, restored the
	  original filenames for the old files (patch now readable),
          and got it finaly working.
	  The old keyboard stuff remains active per default.
	  The new stuff (--enable-new-kbd) also runs fine (atleast on the 3
          machines I have tested), except that ESC on Slangkeyboard has
	  to be typed twiced (result of 'dead keys for accents' ?).

--------------

97/02/04 ver. 0.64.4 released
	From Hans
	- Adapted Steffen Winterfeld's (graphics) true color patch from
	  0.63.1.98 (not his newest from .65) to 0.64.x.
          The code now looks a bit kludgy, because it was written for .98,
          but works great. Scaling (x2) is set for 320x200, so you may miss
          the 'mini window' ;-) also win31 is happy.
	- Added optimized XModeRemap functions for 15/16 bit true color.
	- Upgraded to Slang0.99-38 and fix the odd situation when the
	  system supplied libslang was included, but the headerfiles were
	  taken from dosemu (showing the wrong slang version).
	  Now it uses _completely_ the dosemu or the system supplied files.
	  There is a new ./configure option to force use of the dosemu
	  supplied slanglib: --enable-force-slang
	  BTW: slang.h is now in src/include/slang/*
	- Removed and disabled use of a.out (deleted slang-a.out-lib)
	  for arch-linux.
	- fixed compile warning keyboard-client.c. and changed some
	  'error()' to 'v_printf()' in int10.c
	- made the 'unexpected CPU exception 0x06' error show the correct
	  registers.
	- Fixed the wrong prefix handling in dpmi.c (dpmi_fault),
	  Thanks to Alberto who pointed this out.
	- Added 'secure' option in /etc/dosemu.conf, which disables
          generation of 'whole userspace' descriptors. A DPMI client
          otherwise can modify (a suid root running) dosemu, such that it
          may execute arbitrary commands.
          This option also disables the use of the 'unix' and 'system'
          commands (dos-helper functions 0x50...0x53).
	From John Davis
	- Slang needs -lm with newer libc.
	- If the function and arrow key definitions are in the
	  terminfo library, it will use those
	- Lower the TIMEOUT value for the ESC character from 3/4
	  of a second to 1/4 of a seconds.
	From Andreas Arens <andras@cww.de>
	- New support for Avance Logic VGA cards, needs this in dosemu.conf:
	  video { vga  console  graphics  chipset avance }
	From Alberto
	- Patch for makeing debug print checks faster
	  (ifprintf -> log_printf)
	- Makefile.main patch to fix odds in newer binutils.
97/01/22 ver. 0.64.3.1 released
	From Hans (final fixes)
	- Removed rest of 'history' in include/vm86plus
	- reinstalled include/linux/vm86.h (to avoid compile errors
	  when using libc < 5.4.7)
	- corrected VM86P* typo
	- fixed wrong message on 'make install'
	- made Bernd's timer patch a configure option, because apparently
	  some games don't like it. (--enable-monoton-timing)
97/01/19 ver. 0.64.3 released
	From Hans
	- removed emumodule (don't need it any more;-)
	- cleaned up kernel dependencies
	- adapted ./configure and Makefiles
	- Made mouse functionable for win31-in-xdos (hiding X-cursor,
          calibrating win31 cursor)
	- little fix for xtermdos
	- Updated the docs
	From JES
	- basic mouse functionality for win31-in-xdos
	From Herbert Xu <herbert@greathan.apana.org.au>
	- additions to man/dos.1, man/xtermdos.1
96/12/30 ver. 0.64.2.2 released
	From Erik Mouw
	- sequencer emulator for VGAemu (compatible with Trident 8900)
	  This lets WIN31 run in xdos :-), ... but without mouse :-(
96/12/30 ver. 0.64.2.1 released
	From Hans
	- Finaly got expand-down-fake in DPMI work, so older DJGPP work again.
	  ( and maybe some games too )
	- Additional checks in ./configure for debian inconsistencies,
	  Forcing to ELF, if no GCC specs file available.
	- ... and this time did not forget to increase the version ;-)
	From Erik Mow
	- Additional checks in ./configure for bison installed
	From Grant R. Guenther <grant@knot.torque.net>
	( hey, Grant is the man who hacked the ZIP and other drives using
          dosemu, so he then could write the Linux drivers ;-)
	- "T" debug flag and LOG_IO macro
	From Bernd Paysan <paysan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>
	- fixed the keycodes for AccelX
	- fix for micro timing problems, timer now strictly monotonous
	  ( Bernd's fix _really_ works great, Hans:-)
96/12/07 ver. 0.64.2 released
	From Hans:
	- vm86plus (2nd version) now is in the kernels >= 2.1.15

96/09/24 ver. 0.64.0.2 - From Hans, SMP, emumodule, insmod and some minor DPMI-stuff
96/09/23 ver. 0.64.0.1 - JES took over some valuable patches from 0.63
96/09/18 23:06:34 From : JES - Allow compiling without X support --without-x
96/08/30 01:21:30 From: Eric -- Some more Bugfixes, and a little video cleanup practice

 * added runtime MITSHM detection
 * fixed a problem with mouse initalisation
 * mfs.c: fixed find_first error code if directory doesn't exist
96/08/02 18:45:49 From Alberto - Fix PIC bug even w/o emumodule & leave for vacations
96/08/01 22:39:10 From : JES - Minor changes to pic.[ch]
-	Not sure if these make a difference, but since I'm no C guru, it looked
	like some variable (pic_sys_time) were defined twice? At least it still
	works looking this way ;).
96/07/31 19:57:40 From Alberto - Make debug flag working again & other fixes
96/07/31 18:29:09 From : JES - More IPX fixing and a Video WorkAround
-	After all I went through to learn _not_ to call IPX functions
	directly... I turn around and do it again ;-(. Always call IPXCallRel().
96/07/31 13:57:15 From : JES - Fix IPX again ;(
96/07/31 12:03:14 From : JES - The Real Patch(tm) to bring IPX watchdog into DOSEmu
-	With many thanks to Tim Bird and JL, here is a patch to get 
	asynchronos events happening under DOSEmu. This will make DOSEmu
	nolonger dependent on the wdogfix.com TSR. The problem before was
	making a stack returnable via retf. Also added is an ESR callback
	which may give slight IPX speed inprovements (may not), but 
	prepares DOSEmu for more IPX development ;).
96/07/29 21:33:55 From Alberto - Fixed sig11 in leavedos() and cleaned some warnings

96/07/21 00:51:37 From Alberto - patches to serial code to avoid reentrancy
   problems - Changes to tracing code in ports.c and dpmi.c - Some spelling
   and small bug fixes
96/07/19 22:34:50 From : kan@dcit.cz - Fixes to parsing and Dr? regs.
1) parse_config() used to check the wrong id in order to find out whether
   the user is allowed to have dangerous options in the configfile.
   Hum.. it looks like my own bug...
   (someone already fixed the same thing in parse_dosemu_users())
2) At least one program (I think it was a game--Winter Olympic Games perhaps) 
   plays with dr? registers (trying to avoid being debugged?). This problem 
   made me add some handling for mov dr??, ?? to vm86_GP_fault and make the 
   type of org_eip correct (actually, I did it in the opposite order <smile>)
96/07/10 11:26:50 From Hans: Dosdebug goes DPMI (+some minor DPMI-fixes)
96/07/07 16:13:11 From : JES - Allow stdin to be non-tty
- NO this is not the do-all-end-all to allow remote control access of DOSEmu.
  It is only a stop gap to allow some next steps in testing.

96/06/08 12:28:52 From Uwe : Port Access for (L)Users
Hallo,

the patch I posted yesterday was "cut and dropped" in my editor. That way,
parts get mangled. And I didn't apply it to a clean tree, so an error
slipped by. Here is the patch against 0.63.1.30:
96/06/07 20:12:36 From JES : Reduce HMASIZE by 16 bytes as suggested by HJ
96/06/07 17:11:37 From Hans: emumodule & restore_i387; patches from Bernd
From Bernd Paysan <bernd@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>:
 -  The timer initialization in src/base/init/init.c  reduced to stay
    in 32 bit integer arithmetic.
 -  The mouse handler fakes an interrupt and pusha on the real mode stack,
    regardless if the program is in rm or pm. I added a fake_pm_int().
 -  The X_SELECTION isn't well separated from X_MOUSE. I tried to do it
    (src/env/video/X.c).

96/06/03 12:39:57 From Hans: Fix silly vm86.h include loop (oh yeah, it was my fault).
96/06/02 15:58:42 From Hans: more LDT-access rights if running root, back out old, vm86.h hack
96/05/28 21:33:31 From Hans: forbid kerneld to unload emumodule, vm86.h missing fix.

96/04/27 21:02:23 From: Alistair - SB reorganisation, DMA+SB update
96/04/26 17:11:28 From : Avery Pennarun - dosemu 0.63.1.8 X bugs (and fix)
Avery Pennarun <apenwarr@foxnet.net>
It changes env/video/X.c to use unsigned chars instead of chars for screen
cells.  Due to certain tests in the code, any character >128 (such as
line-drawing characters) would _always_ act as if that line had changed
since the last refresh.  So, in full-screen applications like Borland C++,
the flicker (and related CPU usage) was horrible.

BTW, why on earth is the "byte" typedef a signed char?

Have fun.

96/03/16 16:14:36 From : JES - temporarily turn of port array call of portss.c
	- From some timing investigations it has been discovered that the
	  portss.c array calling code seems to be considerable slower
	  in it's present state. To that end as an interim measure, we
	  will turn it off and use the older single case statement.
96/03/13 19:50:26 From : Alberto Vignani - Change non-existant port read to 0xff again
96/03/13 18:35:53 From : Michael Leodolter <michael@lab1.psy.univie.ac.at> - DPMI work
	- With this stack nested PM programs like DJ200's make/compiler work fine

	- If 0'd out the VGA_EMU_FAULT() because it is not defined
96/03/07 23:39:37 From: John Kohl: turn on X_GRAPHICS for NetBSD
- turn on X_GRAPHICS support for NetBSD, it seems to work well enough
96/03/07 21:00:17 From : JES - Creating proper behavior in dpmi.c KERNEL_LDTALIAS
	- with these diffs, Windows runs again. Need that DPMI guru :-)
96/03/07 20:13:38 From : JES - Supply new configure.in against John's diffs
96/03/07 19:10:38 From : John Kohl - NetBSD diffs for 0.63.1.2
From: John Kohl <jtk@kolvir.arlington.ma.us>
- Anyway, there's a system bug tickled by these changes on NetBSD but it
pretty much works.  
- I haven't tried X graphics support yet, but I made
it easy to configure in or out now.
- I think I found a bug with KERNEL_LDTALIAS in the dpmi code, plus a
questionable missing () stuff there.  Look inside dpmi.c
Thanks!

  This includes the patch from Kevin Buhr (good work),
  plus some fixes to make hardware-IRQs work (Sillyint),
  plus some other pic fixes (correct now, but wasn't the reason for the lock)
  plus THE (one line) fix for the _real_ bug:

    Once again we messed up with VIF flag, hence letting ints pass
    through. even if CLI was active.
    This apparently was one 'bug-catcher' we left back during the
    the great hunt for 'the bug of bugs' some month ago.
    (Hmm... I say 'we', but very well may be that it was 'me') 

  I also introduced a
    #define USE_UNIX_TIME_FOR_INT1A_AH0
  which should be defined at top of dosemu/int.c to get the 'old' code,
  which does not use the BIOS 40:6c timer, but got the time from Linux
  and overwrites 40:6c.
  Currently it is not defined, so INT1A AH=0 gets time from 40:6c,
  however, if somone gets 'timerlocks' again (which I don't hope),
  then try witch defineing USE_UNIX_TIME_FOR_INT1A_AH0 and report to the
  team.

Hi,
   Having some dos stuff which I wanted to run, I decided that it was
time to update my dosemu.  Unfortunately, I still only run a mono HGA
card so dosemu-0.60.3 was not a stunning success.  Anyway, I dug into
the sources to the extent which was necessary to get it to work with
my HGA card and the resulting patches are attached to the end of this
message.  The patches also improve the functionality in that dosemu
now does something more sensible with the cursor.

   Not having followed the development of dosemu closely, I don't
claim that these patches represent the correct way to solve the
problems, only that they work for me under admittedly limited testing.

   The patches also apply cleanly to dosemu-0.60.4.3 (apart from a
trivial Makefile change) and seem to compile o.k., but I haven't
checked the result because I don't want to bother with modules yet.

--Bill

Tue Oct 03	1995

- From: "Pavel Kankovsky" <KAN@frode.dcit.cz>
These my patches are against 0.60.3 (but they seem to still be
usable in 0.61.00 from what I have seen at the first glance).
Here is some description only (usable as ChangeLog entries, I hope),
diffs themselves are enclosed as attached files (dosemu[0-3].diff).

Patch 0 fixes 3 things in mfs.c:
- Mktime() uses tm_isdst value (unlike stated in the original source code)
  leaving it unset causes random mtime shifts by one hour and has funny
  effects esp. when running make, value -1 (which meaning is "figure out
  the proper value yourself" :> ) seems to be the best one for me.
- Hlist stack management was quite 'kludge-o-matic' in the original code
  and caused problems with Quattro Pro 5.0 installation program which 
  starts a directory search, does NOT finish it and spawns unzip program 
  that starts another directory search, and upon unzip's exit, both lists 
  were popped, making the installation die eventually.
  I rewrote findfirst/next and hlist_push/pop to allow this case and
  do it all in a bit cleaner way.
- Findfirst returns FILE_NOT_FOUND no more because original Dos returns 
  this value only for EMPTY directories (even no ., .., volume label!),
  so NO_MORE_FILES is more convenient in most cases (esp. for Volkov 
  Commander -- Norton Cmdr. alike -- that used to complain "Can't read 
  volume in drive X:" every time it got FILE_NOT_FOUND for findfirst)

Patch 1 brings some improvement I made in dosdbg.c and its counterpart
dyndeb.c to help myself when examining PIC working. The original code
does not accept debug levels (as Dosemu command line options do). Now
you can do something like "dosdbg 3r" when Dos boots and reduce the 
debugging log by cca 300 kilobytes. :-)

Patch 2 makes Dosemu safer as it does not allow ordinary users to do
"dos -F ..." with dangerous (e.g. direct disk access) settings in their 
configfiles.

Patch 3 modifies keyboard driver finalization so as to let keyboard leds
follow in-kernel num/caps/scroll-lock flags again. (I was trying to make
it save led-function setting and restore it later but the kernel does not 
seem to provide a straight-forward way of doing it. Bad luck.)

I hope it will help make Dosemu better Dos than Dos! :-)

Mon Oct 02	1995

-	Patches to XMS for better himem compatibility

Wed Oct 11 22:28:05 1995  John Kohl  <jtk@pattern.arlington.ma.us>

	* Update for latest NetBSD stuff

Wed Sep 27	1995

-	Included many patches to get NetBSD back on track.
-	Added in 2 patches for debugger and other en-Hans-ments :-)

Tue Sep 12	1995

-	Added first layer of DMA and SoundBlaster code oringinally
	contributed by Joel Weber (age 15), then put into the
	distribution by Alistair.

Sat Sep 09	1995

-	Added FOSSIL internal support by 
	pasi@forum.nullnet.fi (Pasi Eronen)
-	Added X enhancments and -O option by 
	Uwe Bonnes bon@elektron.ikp.physik.th-darmstadt.de and Pasi.
-	Hans' latest syscallmgr updates.

Thu Jul 28	1995

-	Release DOSEMU-0.60.4.tgz
-	Hans' patch to dpmi.c
-	Added CLTS from rde@tadpole.co.uk (Richard Evans)
-	Added .ini extensions from Jon
-	From Snow Cat
2) pic/pic.c has some assembler code that doesn't work with -O3 because it's
using global labels that get expanded more than once. Fixing it to use local
labels solves the problem.

3) mfs/mfs.c  doesn't handle "commit file" and  "flush all disk  buffers".  It
causes AH=68H/int 21H to return an error code that confuses database programs.
I  changed COMMIT_FILE to do fsync()  and  FLUSH_ALL_BUFFERS to do nothing and
return success (because sync()ing every time DOS wants  to flush buffers makes
too much noise).
.... and some other patches too.

-	Mfs patch from Andi.
-	Mouse patches from beck@informatik.hu-berlin.de (Michael Beck)
-	Patches for UID settings by Steven P. Crain

Wed Jun 28	1995

-	Release DOSEMU-0.60.3.tgz

From Hans :
This is a summary of my changes since dosemu0.60.2:

-       Upgraded syscallmgr/insmod to modutils-1.2.8
        (full insmod-tree is in insmod-1.2.8-HACKER_TOOL.tar.gz)
        Now can (mix) load  a.out- or ELF- modules  into  
        a.out- or ELF- kernels.
-       New LDT support for emumodule, now can access the *real* LDT
        from dosemu user space. How it works can be seen in ldttest.c
-       Made emumod ELF compilable
        ( patch from Rick Sladkey <jrs@world.std.com> )
-       Took over some changes to vm86() from Linux 1.2.11 and 1.3.3
        into emumodule. Also now doing full verify_area on all accessed
        user space in emumodules' vm86() (USE_VM86_STACKVERIFY).
        This fixes some odd DOS register messups.
-       Fixed wrong flag handling in bios.S for INT10 .. INT1B
        (some of them should IRET).
-       Improved return to DOS-space from dosemu redirected INTs
        int dosemu/int.c function do_int().
        (did respawn to dosemu immediately, so leaving the DOSapp
         no chance to react).
-       Fixed interruption of DOS space when interrupts were disabled.
        ( check for VIF at entry of pic's run_irqs() ).
        This fixes the main trouble together with sillyint (exception 6 bug).
        JES did the rest by finding this damned WRITE_FLAGS bug and
        fixing various VIF/IF handling.
-       Now dosemu will do register dump if -g debugflag is set and
        if killed via SIGHUP. So we can see were the DOSapp is hanging.
-       Varous fixing for sillyint (SIG), so it now complies with the
        new pic-handling.
-       Fix startup recognition of loaded emumodule. Now it will exit
        with error if no module is loaded and REQUIRES_EMUMODULE is set.
-       Made dosemu/sigsegv.c real-mode-386-compatible and fixed wrong
        prefix handling (ES,DS,GS,FS,REP).
        Moved some remaining 'fprintf(stderr)' to 'i_printf()'
-       Fixed overload condition resulting in DOS internal stack overflow.
        (<ESC> bug while using SLANG terminal). This is done by monitoring
        the difference between pic_sys_time and pic_dos_time and avoiding
        vm86() respawning to fast when OVERLOAD_THRESHOULD is reached.
        This way DOS has a better chance to catch up some additional
        CPU time in order to be in schedule with pic_sys_time.
-       Fixed dualmon messup (didn't work a lot of last releases).

So long,
Hans
<lermen@elserv.ffm.fgan.de>

	Having said that, please choose to either :
	1) Use emumodule which makes this all redundant
	2) Use this full patch to kernels < 1.2.8

	newbies. You'll need to modify the 
	Makefile if you chose to go with emumodule support
	for this release.

Sat Mar 25	1995

-	Release pl55.
-	Patches by Rod May:
I've got patch for you that will check that partitions

Passing a command to DOSEMU:
============================
	dos -E "command to be passed to DOSEMU" ....
	....
	C:\> unix.exe -e
  	>> RUNS command to be passed to DOSEMU <<

Executing the contents of an UNIX Environment Variable:
=======================================================
	C:\> unix.exe -e ENV_VAR_NAME
	>> RUNS COMMAND NAMED IN env_var_name <<

  NB ENV_VAR_NAME will probably need to be in CAPITALS !

Running a UNIX Command:
=======================
  (As Before...)
	C:\ unix.exe ls -l /dev
	>> RUNS "ls -l /dev" under Linux .... <<

	Also from Scott:
James,

Well, I restarted the patch work that I sent to you some time ago.  I
haven't gotten all the way through it yet (sadly), but here goes:

I propose a naming convention for the initialization procedures:

   xxxx_init()       for something that only gets called once
   xxxx_setup()      for something that gets called at each 'reboot'
                     (e.g. internal reboot -- the code that doesn't work)

-	Dualmon patches from (mouw@morra.et.tudelft.nl> (Erik Mouw)
-	Rewritten unix.c to compile under various DOS C-compilers.

Mon Jan	 30	1995

-	Must mention that JL has added an interrupt watchdog
	timer so that the keyboard behind problem may be resolved.
-	Backed out Marty's exchange_uids() as they were slightly
	incomplete and causing video switching (etc) problems.
-	#if 0'ed Marty's dbg_fd changes until this is complete.
	This has caused some problems for folks trying to boot
	DOSEMU.
-	Added 2 sets of Lutz's DPMI patches.

	reduce DOSEMU CPU time even more during mouse activity.
-	Dissallowed video segment IPC attachment when Xdos is
	used.

Fri Jan	 27	1995

-	Another week, and quite a few goodies. IPX updates
	from Greg Page. Many mouse updates from Alan. Some
	DPMI changes from Dong so that jed386 will run.

-	Renamed termio.* to keyboard.c. Attempted to move all
	keyboard functions into the keyboard subdir.

-	Well, for better or worse, watch out world, I've started
	back again on some of the client/server aspect. Remeber
	that :-)? At this time, dosemu now creates a file:
	/tmp/dosemu.<PID> with basic info and SHM id's. To
	see how amazing this is (pun is intended!), 
	cd clients and make. Then you'll have 2 programs:
	video - To just dump the dos processes 80x25 video screen
		(Must NOT be in graphics or console mode)
	keyboard - To dump what is in the DOSEMU keyboard buffer.
		   (NOT the DOS 40:?? buffer)
	Both programs require a pid as parrameter 1.

Fri Jan	 20	1995

-	Additions by Denis Julitovto make ctrl-alt-del stuff work.

Fri Jan	 16	1995

-	Release pl40
-	Upsetting the DPMI apple cart during testing of timer.exe. Now
	the following rules have been applied with hacking :
	1) calls to realmode procedures do NOT run handle_signals() so
	   that DPMI properly deals with them upon return.
	2) hardware int's are first reflected to the possible
	   protected mode interrupt handle, which may (and usually 
	   does) reflect them back to the realmode handler.

Fri Jan	 13	1995

-	Added Alan's mouse patches
-	Added Scotts big patch to make int.c and move signals into signal.c
-	Small patch to bios_emm.c so that seg -> phy requests are properly
	handled.
Mon Jan  9	1995

-	Small change to EMS so that Allocate pages allows allocation
	of 0 pages. This allows Windows 3.0 to run small EMS frame.
-	Scott has brought garrot into DOSEMU :).
- 	Got Hans's ./tools/sh.kversion to work. sorry Hans.
-	beck@informatik.hu-berlin.de Michael Beck
	Here it comes. The patch is very stupid, and add the classname XDosEmu
	when dosemu runs with X-Support. Use fvwm's ICON "XDosEmu"
	to get the icon.
	BTW, perhaps someone should change the config-parsing, so instead of
	the Iconname the user can set the classname.
	ALSO:
	> > And last: I have converted a lot of fonts for DosEmu from
	> > MS Wind**s FON files and some other sources (CPI and FEDIT files).
	> > Sorryly The FON files are copyrighted, so I think I cannot distribute

	>

	I send you the package, but my english is very bad, so perhaps someone
	check it and rewrote my readme (sorry for that, but my time is
	limited now, the hollidays are over :-(

Sun Jan  8 	1995

-	Released pre0.53_39
-	All Hans' patches to get a working kversion.h system in place.
	Finally we can easily(?) keep dosemu working with various
	releases.
-	From Alan:

	Hi James,

		I saw in the code you've been doing a bit of hacking with 2/3 button
	mice. Well I modified a bit of the code and hope this helps a little.

		What I've done is provided switchable PC Mouse/Microsoft mice modes
	within DOSEMU. I've re-written mouse.S to become mouse.asm (Sorry, I couldn't
	suss out gas to compile dos progs, so I had to use a86). Anyway I've also
	provided the NEW ! raw mouse.com at the end of this message in uuencoded
	format.

		There have been a few more subtle changes to the code that you'll
	probably notice too. One of the more obvious, is that the internaldriver
	now can have 3 button emulation on 2 button mice. 

		Anyway MOUSE.COM now takes some arguments...

			r - resets the iret. Put "mouse r" in your autoexec now..
			i - inquire current configuration of mouse driver.
			p - Set PC Mouse mode (3 buttons)
			m - Set Microsoft mode (2 buttons)

	I'll be implementing more as we go along...

	Some of the PS/2 Mouse BIOS routines have been deleted/re-written, as the
	existing code was wrong.

	Alan.

	Hi again.

		Some more fixes.

		Apparently according to my documentation there are some wrong doings
	in the show/hide stuff. There should be a counter which if 0 the cursor shows,
	but it is possible to do ... hide(), hide() which will make the counter -2,
	then doing a show() with put the counter at -1, but will still not show the
	cursor. Doing another show() will make the cursor appear.

-	Alan's patches to get Hans' emumod system compiling again.
-	Added new lredir.exe and lredir.c from Tim Josling <tej@melbpc.org.au>:

	The problems fixed are:

	Doesn't check that argv[2] exists before using it, causing a loop in some
	cases.

	Function that returns nothing is specified to return some type of int,
	causing compiler complaints.

	Drive mounted read-only is reported as read-write.

	I tested the fixes pretty thoroughly so they shoudl be OK. I compiled
	with Turbo C++ 3.0 when I tested them.

	The file below is the full source in dos format (with ^M's). I tried to
	generate a diff file but this didn't work as the original file didn't
	have the ^M's on many lines so as my editer put them on every line I
	ended up with many spurious diff's.

	The version of lredir was the one from 0.53pl37.

	Regards,
	Tim Josling

-	Added Lutz's latest DPMI patches. GO32 now runs and shows
	memory. Some go32 DPMI programs are running. Yah Lutz.

Wed Jan  4 	1995

-	Released pre0.53_38. Happy New Year.
-	Added Marty's next set of patches.
-	Moved Hans' enhancements form 'make doeverything' to
	'make itall' so that as kernels change, make doeverything
	remains OK.
-	Jiggled around where ioctl's to acquire_vt were in vc.c in
	an effort to stop more of the VC switch hanging bug.

Tue Jan  3 	1995

-	Added Marty's Unix.exe to send unix commands from DOSEMU.
	To use, just ln files to a unix.exe that you wish to run. 
	I.E:
	 ln ./commands/unix.exe ls.exe
	 from within dosemu, just enter ls and the ls command is executed.
-	Added two parms to call to show_reg( __FILE__, __LINE__) to
	track down where show_regs() are being called from.

Sun Jan  1 	1995

-	Added return to getKey() function in ./keyboard/termio.c when
	screen is not current. Fixed screen lockups here.
-	Removed (added #if 0) code setting bs_pos to -1 for root dir deletes

Mon Dec  19	1994

-	Added Marty's latest Makefile enhancements. This included 2 new
	files (data.c extern.h) and including int.h inside of
	emu.c. Marty promises emu.c will get smaller :-)
-	Added Lutz's latest DPMI enhancements.

Sun Dec  11	1994

-	Changed check for mouse in graphics mode by using video
	regs.
-	Latest updates from BOCHS project.
-	Modified MICKEY concept in mouse.c so that WordPerfect now
	works with internal mouse. Doing this blind folks. Anxiously
	waiting for Alan's next set of mouse enhancements.

Tue Jan  3 09:49:22 1995  Jochen Hein (Hein@Informatik.TU-Clausthal.de)

	* keyboard layout gr renamed to de, like keyboard-utils.

Fri Dec  9	1994

-	Release pl37
-	Added garrot02 to dosemu. I think it should be separate on 
	tsx?

Sat Dec  3	1994

-	Update to add different X fonts :

	Hi!

	I just added support to change the font used with XDOS.  There is a new
	keyword, "font", in the X-section of the config file which allows you to
	specify the font to be used.  If the font is not a monospaced font (or can't
	be found) "vga" is still the default.

	There is no translation done, i.e. the font has to be an IBM font!

	So, if someone wants to create a smaller font...

	BTW, the include file "linux/segment.h" changed to "asm/segment.h" somewhere
	around linux 1.1.67 (it is used in dpmi.c).

	The diffs are against pre0.53pl36.

	to Kevin for the Bochs team.

Tue Nov  21     1994

-	Added RPT_SYSCALL's to some writes. Kinda kludgy for know :-(
-	Latest SLANG enhancements:
Hi,

   I added the ability to access ALT, SHIFT, and CONTROL keys for remote
terminals.  For example, one can now use alt function keys as well as
Ctrl-Backspace, Shift-tab to get the backtab, Ctrl-Arrow, etc....

   Below, you will find a uuencoded file called `files.tar.gz'.  After
unpacking it, you will see:  termio.c, slang-termio.c, and terminal.c.slang.
The latter files should go in the `video' subdir and the other two go in the
`keyboard' subdir.  `termio.c' is exactly like the one already there.  The
changes are marked by `#ifdef USE_SLANG' stuff.

   Note that in slang-termio.c, you will find 3 global variables:
   
static char *Alt_Shiftkey = "^@A";
static char *Ctrl_Shiftkey = "^@C";
static char *Shift_Shiftkey = "^@S";

These should be initialized by the user by whatever mechanism you prefer.
They represent the keysequence that invokes the appropriate modifier key,
e.g., to get the next key ALT, press `Ctrl-@ A'.  Perhaps, it might be
easier to simply use `Ctrl-A' but I wanted to demonstrate that one can use a
multiple character key sequence.  When one of these keys are pressed, an
indicator will appear at the bottom of the screen indicating this. (The new
terminal.c.slang does this).

I had a terrible time getting the ESC key timout to work properly at 2400
baud.  As a result, I have eliminated the ESC timeout from the slang
version.  If you want to send an ESC, hit it twice.  The alternative simply
does not work and hitting it twice when an escape is needed is alot less
painful.  One can always rebind the escape key on the terminal emulator to
send two escapes.

Obviously, we will want to add some mechanism to rebind keys.  I do not
believe that relying on the keys as defined in termcap is adequate.  For
example, one might want to rebind Ctrl-E to escape for a DOS program that
uses the ESC alot.

Sat Nov  12	1994

- Release pre0.53_33.
- Han's latest, now he has a self-contained emumodule that includes
  SIG and really gives DOSEMU the power it has desired for quite some
  time to make use of the kernel. You will need to set the #if 0 to 1
  in emu.h as well as:
  /* From Hans: If you you need the emumodules special features
   * You also must load the modules as follows:
   *   login in as root
   *   cd /usr/src/dosemuXXX/syscallmgr
   *   ./insmod syscallmgr.o
   *   ./insmod -m ../emumod/emumodule.o
   */

More background:

Hi Jim

As you didn't show up at IRC, I send you some explanations about the
new emumodule stuff and inbedded sillyint.

I established two interfaces to the emumodule, which I think can be
expanded for all other features, that we need in the future:

1. A standard Linux systemcall (over syscallmgr) for all
   functions that needs the kernel support functions (like printk).
   During within this syscall, the scheduler and/or an interrupt
   may take away control from dosemu.
   The calling convention of this syscal is defined in
   ./include/emusys.h as
       extern inline int emusyscall(int mode, int params)
   and can be called at this time as

   result = emusyscall(EMUSYS_GETVERSION,0);
   result = emusyscall(EMUSYS_GETSUPPORT,0);
   result = emusyscall(EMUSYS_REQUEST_IRQ,irqnum);
   result = emusyscall(EMUSYS_FREE_IRQ,irqnum);
   
2. I implemented a so called fast syscall via an INT 0xe6 to Linux
   (not to DOS).
   This syscall has not the great overhead that the standard syscall
   has and can't be interrupted by Linux's scheduler or interrupts.
   With this we can access kernel space much faster then with kmem
   or other techniques and also we can set some bits of emumodules
   variable. We can check some status, and after return from
   fastsyscall we are shure that the status is what it says.
   Its also possible to realized some of the DPMI functions with
   this kind of syscall.
   But, this syscall must run with interrupts disabled, and also
   can only use some the kernels macros, but not the support functions
   which leads to rescheduling e.t.c.
   I used this type of syscall to get and reset the IRQ-bits of
   sillyint.
   Also the fastsys calls are defined in ./include/emusys.h and
   currently there exists:

   extern inline int fastsyscall(int mode) /* generic call */
   extern inline int get_and_reset_irq(int irqnum)
   extern inline int get_and_set_irq(int irqnum)
   extern inline int get_irq_bits(void)

To enable dosemu to use the new features there must be REQUIRES_EMUMODULE
defined in emu.h (see at the comments at top of this file).
If it is not defined, sillyint is used as usual.

One thing at last: I always are on war with "make", so please check
and change the Makefiles, that they do compile emumod/ and syscallmkgr/
if REQUIRES_EMUMODULE is set. I was to silly to do so.
I also would like to do make from the subdirectories directly during
devellopment phase.

...Ah, and the patch fits into 0.53.32 with dualmon.patch already in.

So long
Hans
<lermen@elserv.ffm.fgan.de>

-  Small patch to ./mouse/mouse.c which resets the initiated mouse
   subroutine on calls to fnx 0x21. This previously wasn't reset and
   caused future programs to crash DOSEMU when they loaded over that
   space. Now to see why some programs (Foxpro/Word Perfect Office) 
   don't recognize the internal mouse driver :-(.

Wed Nov  9	1994

-	Various patches from lee@tengu.in-berlin.de (Kang-Jin Lee) to
	makefiles.

- From Hans :
#   - If you have a dual-monitor configuration (e.g. MDA as second display),
#     you then may run CAD programs on 2 displays or let play your debugger
#     on the MDA while debugging a graphics program on the VGA (e.g TD -do ).
#     You also may switch to the MDA display by using the DOS command
#     mode mono (mode co80 returns to your normal display).
#     This feature can be enabled by the switch "dualmon" like this:
#       video { vga  console  graphics dualmon }
#     and can be used on a xterm and the console, but of course not, if you
#     have the MDA as your primary display.
#     You also must set USE_DUALMON 1 in include/video.h.
#     NOTE: Make shure no more then one process is using this feature !
#           ( you will get funny garbage on your MDA display. )
#           Also, you must NOT have the dualmon-patches for kernel applied
#           ( having the MDA as Linux console )
#

-	From Rob May:
Hi James!
        yep, this is an interesting point. It's not just lilo that will
have problems, some other boot sector programs (which rewrite the MBR)
will need this "workaround" and therefore won't work with this patch.
(I would recommend using one of the newer boot sector programs as they
are better than lilo, but this is a different point).
        Unfortunately this "workaround" is a very poor long term
solution, as using the current part-table is the only safe option.
This only affects people who boot using DPA with lilo up their MBR, but...
Since we are basically hacking the part-table to only one valid bootable
partition, a solution is to cut out the middle-man and boot the partition
directly, this way we get the current part-table and whatever boot
sector code you have is irrelevant. Patch to emu.c follows....
        Any Comments?

From: Rod May <stoke@melbourne.DIALix.oz.au>
Hi there,
	here's a patch (to pl28) which makes the use of "mkpartition" 
unnecessary for direct partition access. Also the partition number is no
longer required. i.e. instead of specifying:
	disk { partition "/dev/hda3" 3 }  and running "mkpartition",
you only have to specify:
	disk { partition "/dev/hda3" }
The MBR is read from the appropriate hard drive during start-up.
Not only does this simplyfy things but stops potential mistakes
including: out of date MBRs, specifying hda instead of hda3 etc. 
These were not flagged before and could lead to "interesting" results. 
Using the old format will get you a config warning but otherwise
the partition number will just be ignored,
	Ciao,
		Rod May,
		stoke@melbourne.dialix.oz.au


Hope this patch is useful, next effort might be read_sectors() which
needs a bit of work!
		bye for now,
				Rod.

Hi Jes -

Here is the new pic code.  It is implemented as contidional code, so you'll
have to un-comment a line in the Makefile if you want to try it.
Look for the string NEW_PIC in the Makefile; the instructions are right
before it.

Because the serial.c pic mods don't work very well yet, I have provided
two options:  The firstone only implements pic for keyboard and timer code.
This stuff is pretty solid, and I would appreciate bug reports, etc.
The second option implements pic for timer, keyboard, and serial interrupts.
The serial code is knows to have bugs, although it is useable.  PLEASE,
if all you know is that the serial code doesn't work right, DON'T send
a bug report.  I already know that much :-).  On the other hand, if you have
a fix, or even just a partial one, please let me know.  The serial bug
shows as an extermely low send rate; only half as fast as whennot using pic.

I would appreciate any bug reports on the keyboard and timer code.  They are 
not complete, but I believe this code to be bug-free.

And now, a (very) little technical information for the curious:

There are two big differences when using pic.  First, interrupts are not
queued beyond a depth of 1 for each interrupt.  It is up to the interrupt
code to detect that further interrupts are required and reschedule itself.
Second, interrupt handlers are designated at dosemu initialization time.
Triggering them involves merely specifying the appropriate irq.

Since timer interrupts are always spaced apart, the lack of queueing has no
effect on them.  The keyboard interrupts are re-scheduled if there is
anything in the scan_queue.  The keyboard pseudo-input register,
*LASTSCAN_ADD, is set to 1 (an otherwise unused value) to indicate that it
has been read, and can therefore be re-filled.  Both the keyboard and timer
bios routines now have outb 0x20 to signal the EOI.  The OUTB_ADDR is no
longer used.

This has been slow in coming, I know; and it will be a while before it gets
fully utilized.  But, at least when the serial code gets done, it should
help get dpmi on its way.  I'll keep working on this; I think it has a lot
of potential to help organize the code.  Good luck with it to all, and
thanks in advance for any comments.

Sun Oct 16 1994 JES

Hi there!
        Here's my patch for allowing DPA access to specific logical
partitions under dosemu. It applies to the patch level 27 code of
disks.[ch].
        Access to specfic logical partitions, rather than entire
extended partitions, is a great idea for the same reason that partition
access is better than wholedisk access: one day a poor linux
partition will suffer. Its used by specifying a part number greater
than 4  e.g.:
        disk { partition "/dev/hda5" 5 }
the number itself does mot matter (as long as its greater than 4) as it
is the device name that's used to derive the part table entry info.
The only query is that I raised the MAX_HDISKS in disk.h from 4 to 8,
(I'm using 7 at the moment with no probems). Also I wasn't sure of the
number to pass to leavedos for the BLKGETSIZE error, is there a
convention for this?
        This should never never happen though (famous last words).
        Hope this is useful to others,
        email me with any questions,

                        Ciao,
                                Rod May.

Well, here now is the summery of things that are in my patches which
I have tested under Linux-1.1.50.
( the patches come in a separate mail, because my mailer cannot handle
too large mails )

1. Loadable driver sillyint.o
   It is compiled via a normal "make doeverything"
   and put into the directory /boot/modules.
   I changed the sig/Makefile, it also needs to know where the kernel
   sources are (USRSRCDIR).
   The source needs a -DMAKE_LOADABLE_DRIVER to compile sillyint.o
   The same source can be used (without the -DMAKE..) to compile the
   kernel linked in driver. I changed the sig/HowTo.

   The device major is put into an global variable SIG_MAJOR, so it
   can be changed on loadtime by
     insmod /boot/modules SIG_MAJOR=31


2. Multiple SIG IRQ's can be defined in /etc/dosemu.conf and
   also wether to use SIGIO or not. (see examples/config.dist)
   Because of "sillint off", there is no need to disable SIG
   via compile time option SIG. I recommend to let it be #define SIG 1.
   I did not succeed with setting up a test for two IRQs at the same time,
   so me and other people have to test it in the future.


3. Mapping of hardware ram is configurable via

     hardware_ram { 0xc8000 }  # one 4K page mapped
   or
     hardware_ram { 0xc8000 range 0xcc000 0xcffff }  # multiple mapped pages

   I added an overlap test to avoid wrong mapping, it is done after
   configuration is finished, so it should catch all errors.
   It relates to EMS, VBIOS and HARDWARE_RAM.


4. EMS-frame is now movable (needed for ram conflicts).
   The ems keyword is expanded as follows:
     ems { 1024 ems_frame 0xe000}
   or
     ems { ems_size 1024 }  # defaults to old size of 0x10000

   But the old syntax is valid too.


5. Size of VBIOS now configurable (most BIOSes at 0xc0000 have only 32K
      so I can gain some space for hardware ram and/or UMBs).
      /etc/dosemu.conf line:
        added flag "vbios_size"


6. I corrected a situation (not a bug) concerning the "c" debug flag.
   If "c" was switched off in /etc/dosemu.conf, you could not get
   the config printout via
     dos -D+c
   Now this is possible.



That's all for now, ...so long,
Hans

-	Messed more with timer interrupt so that setting date backwards
	doesn't cause divide overflow. Seems to fix it for going
	ahead and back through time. Only problem is that when DOS
	sees it's past 24hrs, it always moves its date ahead a day :-(.
-	Changed config.graphics to config.vga in emu.c to control 
	setting allowvideoportaccess to 0.
-	Added vc switching (set_process_control) to new signal_queue.
	From conversation with JL I'm not sure this is gonna be solid
	since now the signal_queue being run to switch VC's will rely
	on returns from vm86().
	Still doesn't fix bad crashing when running Windows3.0 which
	takes down my whole UNIX box :-(.
-	Stopped DOSEMU from exiting when no diskette in drive.
-	Added note to add users to /etc/dosemu.users in QuickStart.
-	Fixed parsing of -C option to NOT expect arguements.

-	PRE53_21 Released.
-	Messed with timer code. Changed tick setting to different
	method and relied on time() to give acurate time.
	Found what seems to be the 24 hour bug and inilated it!!!!!!
	With many thanks to Corey.
-	Added backspace/delete patch to Xkeyb.c. Thanks to Scott and Mark.
-	Hacked up HogThreshold again. Rule: Closer you set to 0, the
	lower the CPU usage. At 0 though, hogThreshold is turned off,
	and int16/int2a are run full open.
-	Added HogThreshold to int2a.
-	Added patches to bring -F config file option back to life
	thanks to Dino Dini <ddini@dircon.co.uk>.
-	Added patches to ./video/X.c for better color reps thanks
	to Mark.
-	Prepared to move vc_acquire/release under new signal
	handling... but failed miserably :-(.
-	Makefile additions by Mark.

Tue Sep 20 1994 Jmaclean

-	Removed most coding from SIGIO and SIGALRM signals in an
	effort to remove race conditions. Now these signals just
	mark that they've occured, save their context, and 
	continue. Lutz's DPMI will suffer :-(. Probably best to 
	go through DANG to get an idea of what's going on :-).

Mon Sep 19 1994 Jmaclean

-	Wrapped lpt opens in exchange_uids() to allow "lpr" to run at
	user level.
-	Modified Makefile to create libdosemu$(EMUVER)pl$(PATCHL) and link
	libdosemu to it. Now folks can compare releases just by changing
	symlinks. Probably not what was wanted, but a close facsimile :-).
-	Added SIG mods by Hans Lermen (lermen@elserv.ffm.fgan.de). More to
	come.
-	Cleaned up boot() in emu.c to just boot. Added memory_init() for
	all specific memory setups for proper i86 boots.
-	Added portuguese keyboard map.

Sun Sep 18 1994 Jmaclean

-	Removed ioc_fd and replaced all occurances with kbd_fd.
-	Started DANGing :-).

fri Sep 16 1994 Jmaclean

-	Another change to the readonly open error
-	Fix to mfs.c for return values for readonly mfs drives.

Sat Sep 10 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added new dialog script from Jan Vandenburge.

-	Fixed internal Mouse driver not setting up for new SIGIO calls. 
	Thanks to Alan for providing a fix... But  I  did  it ...
	my  way  :-). Hope you don't mind Alan.

-	Fixed SERIAL not working. Martin's code was returning in
	outb before anything was done :-(.

-	And now a little from Alan...:

Hi James..

	Not my usual stuff but I had to fix it.

	The parser seemed to be screwed up for me, in that it parsed two
files, both the local .dosrc and the /etc/dosemu.conf, this resulted in
the first linux drive becoming f:. All because the system though I had two
hard disks and one floppy image due to the parsing twice of the configs.

	Anyway attached is a fix so that it parses the local .dosrc first...
If it doesn't find one it takes the /etc/dosemu.conf.

	Secondly, I've implemented an /etc/dosemu.users file, similar to
minicom's way of working. This allows only selected users to execute dosemu.
Create the /etc/dosemu.users file with, on each line, the name of the user
allowed to execute DOSEMU.
	This approach could be later expanded to specifying devices in the
dosemu.users file, so that only selected users are able to open specific
devices.
	Thirdly, I had to fix up the Makefile a little for ease of use.
Notice I've defined an X11LIBDIR now too.

Cheers.

Alan.

-	Also:

James,
	For some reason the gfx_cursor for the mouse was commented out.
I checked the docs and someone commented it out because it was crashing the X
stuff. Well, This fix should get rid of that. As it only call mouse_do_cur()
if we are not running X. Before it was trying to mmap even when X was running.
Bad idea .....

Tue Sep 06 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added sig subdir with Silly Interrupt Generator in toe. Did
	some preliminary testing with SIG to get it working with
	1.1.x kernels.

Mon Sep 05 1994 Jmaclean

-	From Rain:

I guess I let this stuff rust on my harddisk long enough, so here's 
another patch ;)

It includes:

- support for 28/43/50 line modes
- make xdos exit properly when it fails to open the X server
  (!includes a change to the printer code!)
- a color (xpm) icon :-)
- auto-detection of readonly floppies, which newer kernels require.

It also includes my attempts to make bios scrolls scroll the X window
directly, in the hope that it would make things faster. 
However, I found that it's at least as often slower as it's faster...

I disabled the code and left it in just because Mark might be interested
to use it for the terminal modes.

bye,
Rainer

-	From Martin Ludwig :

Hello James!

Here is my diff of dosemu pre53_12 to use a second (HGA) monitor for
dosemu while using X. I hope it will patch against pre53_15, too.

Changes against pre53_12:
* new switches -Y and -Z: giving the names of the keyboard and mouse pipe
* keyboard input from pipe instead of STDIN
* mouse input from pipe instead of asking a mouse port
* doesn't  install video-bios, uses int10.h instead
* watches port I/O of HGA-card and remapps video-memory if the second
  page is used
* uses an own cursor position routine (the one in dosemu 0.52 was removed...)
* new X-prog (xdos) which sends mouse and keyboard events from X
  to dosemu, emulating a raw keyboard

Bugs:
* no semaphore for the HGA-memory
* no mouse in graphics mode
* no test if HGA-card is there
* it leaves rxvt or xterm disturbed if started from there
* problems with msherc-programs and the second page
* large xdos-window
* some others, I think

Future plans:
* remove the bugs
* data exchange with X-progs
* perhaps an CGA or EGA emulator for HGA


Copyright:
* the same conditions as for dosemu

I hope that's all, here is the diff

Martin
Martin.Ludwig@ruba.rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de

Tue Aug 30 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added dosconfig script by Jan Vandenberghe. Requires DIALOG. I like
	it :-).
-	Included patches from Heiko for X and timer.
-	Fixed emubat config thanks to Scottb.
-	Modified io_select() calls to start dividing into 2 camps, 
	those that use sigio and those that don't.
-	Added SIGIO ability to internal mouse driver.

Fri Aug 26 1994 Jmaclean

-	Fix that HJ already sent in and I missed :-( for the 
	-T arguement of ld from flebbe@tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de.

Wed Aug 24 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added Enhancements to CDROM driver by Karsten Rucker.
-	Added Lutz's STI patches and kernel patch sti.pat in .kernel

Fri Aug 19 1994 Jmaclean

-	Changed OpenKeyboard to keyboard_init and closeKeyboard
	to keyboard_close. Moved these out of video init procs and
	into there own separate calls. This was causing problems
	in video_config_init() as it would map in video bios
	illegally :-(.
-	Added Conditional for SIG in sigalrm to help io_select()

Wed Aug 17 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added scan to charcode returned in Xkeyb.c by put_key()
-	Tried to get lexer.l back up :-(

Tue Aug 16 1994 Jmaclean

-	Messed around with Rain's patches until all modes started
	to work. Mostly order of routines during initialization
	that had minor problems. Now for example, telnet works
	again.

Sun Aug 14 1994 Jmaclean

-	Removed SOME __inline__'s from mfs.c, still memory pig :-(.
-	Rain's latest patches.
-	Minor fixups to various files.
-	New Makefile from Mark.

Sat Aug 12 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added Rain's massive cleanups and X mouse support. This is
	NOT tested and will need some time to smoothen out.
- 	Added keymaps fixes for sg-latin1 from :
	pingu@satu.baboon.ch (Ruedi Kneubuehler).

Fri Aug 12 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added Scottb's patches to bios_emm.c and lexer.l
-	Added lsm to ./doc subdir

Thr Aug 11 1994 Jmaclean

-	Fixed keyboard latin1 statement and latin1 codes for better
	emualtion thanks to vilva@xiron.pc.helsinki.fi (Veijo Vilva).

Wed Aug 10 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added back some termio ioctl's to set ISTRIP,IGNBRK,OPOST
	and such. Seems to remove backspace in non-rawkeyboard
	mode.
- 	Added -lfl to toplevel makefile for fixing new parser not
	resolving required libs.
-	Added check to NOT add release key for ascii's with high 
	byte 0x00.

Mon Aug 08 1994 Jmaclean

-	Thanks to Rob for pointing out the NCURSES raw() command
	interference by way of his messages, the ICRNL thing should
	be dispersed, and replaced with possible new bugs :-).
-	CD-ROM extensions for DOSEMU with thanks to Karsten
	Rucker (rucker@astro.uni-bonn.de).
- 	Parser additions from Scottb. We are back to the NEW
	parser. Developer/Tester beware :-).
- 	DOSEMU-HOWTO updates from Mike.

Fri Aug 05 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added kludge to keyboard so that keypresses in non-console
	keyboard mode send keypress then keyrelease sequences. This
	seems to fix atleast WordPerfect double chars. Doesn't
	seem to help German aumlets though :-(.
-	Scottb's latest parser patches adding back emu(sys/bat) and
	a debug { X on } option.

Thu Aug 04 1994 Lutz

- dpmi/call.S is now totally rewritten to fix a problem with
  returning to DOS code (stack problem).
- CallToInit() deleted
- more dpmi cleaning/preparing

Wed Aug 03 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added patches from Tomi, Scottb to new parse generator...
	but put back in old parse generator fot this release. Well
	step back to this one hopefully in the next release.
-	Added Rain's Xdos patches. Folks, we're well on our way :-).
	Please read README.X and thank Rain for getting everything on
	it's way.

Mon Aug 01 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added new parser combo lexer.l/parser.y from Scott for all
	to play with. A bit rough but Scott would enjoy feedback :-).
- 	Fix for bug in cursor positioning that causes garbage sometimes
  	This can be a MAJOR improvement to some people because it's appliation-
  	specific.
- 	Invisible cursor support in console mode.  More visually pleasing.
- 	Cursor in ANSI and NCURSES is now put at position 0,0 whenever the
  	cursor is invisible or off-screen.
- 	Improvements to character blinking disable/enable code (this stops the
  	annoying blinking when you run PCTools over a telnet line)

-	Note from Markkk about new ansi_xterm :

"ANSI Xterm 2.0 is a specially modified Xterm that is compatible with DOSEMU
and to enable the use of all 16 colors, and the entire PC character set.
This makes DOSEMU just like xdos in this area!

Furthermore, just follow the instructions included with ANSI Xterm 2.0
for an easy compile.  Then all you need to do is type "xdosemu" to bring
up an Xwindow running DOSEMU.   The xdosemu command automatically detects
for the existence of ansi_xterm.  If it does not exist, it detects for
a regular xterm and rxvt next.

Try it, and let Mark Rejhon know at mdrejhon@csclub.uwaterloo.ca
as he is responsible for this."

Mon Aug 01 1994 Jmaclean

-	Markks latest and greatest additions to the Xterm capabilities
	of DOSEMU. Best to get ansi_xterm from a site at this time :-).
-	Detach capability added, thanks to Karl Hakimian. Now with 
	the optional -d parm, a new VT will be switched to for starting
	and running DOSEMU.
-	Added __map_page() to fix EMS error caused by remap() calling
	__unamp_page() first. FoxPro is running again.

Fri Jul 29 1994 Jmaclean

-	By Jon's request, set '_''s to '-' in keyboard parms
	in examples/config.dist
-	By Jon's request, added 'make most' option which does
	NOT make the doc subdir.

Tue Jul 26 1994 Jmaclean

-	Thanks to Scottb which fixed the DOSEMU memory problems
	with pointing out that mmap annonymous needed PRIVATE and
	not SHARED to work :-) We're back on the road again .

Sat Jul 23 1994 Rain

 * Largely reworked {re}{un}map_page, removed v_mmap.
   COPY/MMAP/IPC_EMS conditionals are now in map_page and friends.
   Fixed MMAP_EMS: mmap() mapped the wrong way around  (-:
   Still doesn't work, mmap() patch is broken :-(
 * EMS_IPC is completely screwed up and probably not easy to make work.
   The problem is that one cannot do partial mappings of shared
   memory regions. Left it in, though.
 * added COPY_EMS conditional (for the standard 'mapping' method)
 * added UNMAP_BEFORE_MAP conditional to leave out unmapping
   of old mappings in map_page for MMAP_EMS.
   Shouldn't be necessary because the kernel'll do this for us.
 * made some calls to re{un}map_page dependent on COPY_EMS
   because they are only there to update the logical memory
 * restore_handle_state: unmap pages which were previously unmapped
 * reallocate_pages:
   reunmap only pages belonging to the current handle.
   Fixed a bug: pages above newcount were left mapped.
 * some minor optimizations, fixes and cleanups...

Thr Jul 21 1994 JES

	- Patches from Rainer Zimmermann (zimmerm@Mathematik.UNi-Marburg.DE)
	  for time-problems with mfs.c
	- Added procedure to make dosemu.map which is usefull for 
	  finding where DOSEMU bombs, like kernel. Thanks Daniel :-)

Sat Jul 14 1994 JES

	- Latest enhancements from Markkk.

Sat Jul 11 1994 JES

	- Latest termio.c with keyboard enhancements from Markkk

	* reformatted highscan[] in termio.c

Sat Jul 09 1994 JES

	- DPMI patches from Lutz
	- Pktdriver enhancements by Rob
	- Mouse patch from Douglas Gleichman p86884@tcville.ES.hac.com
	- Changed install dos as per Jochen
	- Windows 3.0 mouse is back.
	- I added insert esc-seq to gettermcap of termio.c 

Tue Jul 05 1994 JES

	- Finally... Markkk succeeds where so many of us have failed.
	  NCURSES support is here, and I believe to stay :-). It's 
	  still a bit rough, but it IS. You should truly think about
	  getting ncurses-1.8.5.tgz from:
	  netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal/ncurses/1.8.5.tgz
	  This of course brings color to serial lines and preps for
	  many more. I couldn't activate it on a telnet or rlogin 
	  connect yet. Thanks Markkk, from many of us :-).

Sat Jul 02 1994 JES

	- Finally... interrupt routines are called by functions of
	  an array. I'm certain that someone can come up with a better
	  method as I'm using 0x100 pointers in interrupt_function().

Tue Jun 28 1994 JES

	- Markkk brings actuall character set to DOSEMU
	  when in non-graphics mode ... Yaaa :-). Pease
	  read README.ibmset
	- Patch to modify timers done in SIGALRM.

Fri Jun 24 1994 JES

	- Markks console cursor patches, and more speed increses to
	  serial stuff.
	- Small change to mfs.c to correct wrong return codes for
	  findfirst. Seems t speed up directory searches, but may
	  just be my imagination :-).
	- Messed around with SIGILL a bit to try and track down reported
	  problem starting DOSEMU for some that causes SIGILL with 
	  instr of 2e:f7 (cs:div?). No solution yet.
	- Hacked ./init/parse.c a bit to exchange_uids when running
	  overide config files. Now /etc/dosemu.conf always runs, then
 	  overrides can be speced in optional config files.
	  Doesn't work yet :-(

Tue Jun 14 1994 JES

	- Next set of patches from Markkk. Major overhaul started
	  that is really improving termcap. Way to go Markkk!
	- Alistair has completed in no time flat his automoted 
	  DANG application. At this time I have NOT included his
	  perl script, but hope to soon. Look in ../doc/DANG[.sgml].
	- Michael provides us with an updated DOSEMU-HOWTO in 
	  .txt,.ps, and .sgml format.
	- Alan has another few patches bringing mice support along
	  even further.
	- Tim's IPX patches for 1.1.14 kernels +.

Mon Jun 13 1994 JES

	- First set of termcap patches from Markkk

	support.
-	Alessandro Rubini (rubini@ipvvis.UNIPV.IT) patches to make 
	Makefiles inherit important common include directory paths.
-	By suggestion from Jon Tombs, make default inb return 0xff
	and the creation of tempdir be strdup'ed incase it's freed
	by a config request.
-	Changed CNTR timers to count UP by 0x2221 instead of down.
-	Changed a compare in xms.c according to Scott Buchholz.

Thu Jun 02 1994 JES

-	Patches from Rob including updates to s3 code.
-	Daniels idea about malloc problem worked into emu.c by
	moving where scrbuf is allocated. Wonder why it was allocated
	where it was.

Sun May 29 1994 JES

-	Stuck in a fix for DIR a: error. It's a KLUDGE  for now, but
	I hope it will show where the error is.

Thr May 26 1994 JES

-	More mods to int_queue_run(). Changed where set_leds() is 
	called.
-	Moved int.h and int10.h to emu.c as that is where do_int()
	is called mostly now.
-	Scott's latest patches against 1.0.x & 1.1.x
-	Rob's patches to remove linpkt from DOSEMU tree.

	added his patches to bios_emm.c. Bios_emm.c is NOT using
	these by default (See MMAP_EMS in bios_emm.c).
-	Changed run_vm86() use of int_queue_running to *OUTB_ADD.
-	Added extra sti to int10 bios handler.
-	Added Jochen's patches to Makefile.

Wed May 18 1994 JES

-	Added EMS patch from Scott
-	Added diffs from Jochen.
-	Started work on keyboard simplifying. Made lastscan into
	*LASTSCAN a bios area variable.

Mon May 17 1994 Jochen

-	Changed int 8&9 to use a memory location in bios for outb(0x20).
	This nolonger needs to back off to DOSEMU from an outb20. This
	caused vm86() not to return enough to run it's int8's, so 
	sigalrm has been modified to be called more often. At the same
	time I now have the pit controllers decremented. Not sure if
	this will be of any use or not. For fun just change the 
	TIMER_DIVISOR define at the top of emu.c
	(Hopefully I'll do this for int9 scancodes next)

-	Fixed bug in EMS coded Sunday that stopped Windows 3.0 from
	properly launching programs.

-	Makefile fixed to distribute ./ipxutils. Thanks Jochen.

-	Added Lutz's fix for Sigsegv()'s.

Sun 15 May 1994 JES

-	To EMS added Alternate Map Register Set, OS/E Function Set.
	Windows 3.0 now boots without EMS error(All necessary FNX's
	are supported). Some other cleanup's to EMS including Handle
	Naming.

Thr 13 May 1994 JES

-	Totally changed int_queue_run(). Now only int's requiring
	callback will be forced to.

Wed 11 May 1994 JES

-	Markkk's latest serial.
-	Made ipxutils subdir optionally compile

Tue 10 May 1994 JES

-	Made int08 inline, still need 0x1c to be inline too.
-	Added back outb20 check to fix stacking of interrupts
	which included int08 stacking.
-	Floppy drive sticking has mysteriously vanished.

Mon 9 May 1994 JES

-	IPX updates by Tim Bird. Please look in ./ipxutils for more
	info.
-	Addition of -n pktdrvr option by Rob. Look in 
	./examples/config.dist.
	
Sat 7 May 1994 Jochen

	* [disk.c disk.h]
	creating the name for the partition-decsription-file moved to
	parse.c, because we need to check the existance of this file there.
	without this file is running further useless. dosemu may hang
	silently.

	* [emu.c]
	use config.exitearly instead of exitearly and stop dosemu earlier
	when set.

	* [parse.c config.dist include/mouse.h mouse/*]
	attempt to use cleardtr for some mousesystem/microsoft compatible
	mice. mostly unsuccesful.

	* [init/Makefile init/parse.c]
	more compiler warnings removed. Error-checking implemented.

	mice.
-	Lutz includes patch against 1.1.11.

May 2, 1994  JES

	problem of serial port being touched inadvertantly :-(
-	pktnew/libpacket patches from Rob.

May 3, 1994 Jochen

-       Files installed in places where they may match the FSSTND

April 29, 1994  JES

-	Lutz's Latest kernel diff's. Now just 1 small one against 
	1.1.10 and 1 for the 1.0.x kernels. This has fixed the 
	EmuBat/Sys boot option problem.

-	First attempt to move net stuff into net subdir and create
	1 ../net.o object for linking.

April 27, 1994  JES

-	If your kernel is of the 1.0.x nature, patch with 
	kernel.1.0.x.diff. If your kernel is 1.1.x where x is less
	than 9, patch with kernel.1.1.9.diff. If your kernel is
	1.1.9 patch with kernel.post.1.1.9.diff. Have fun :-)

	deskview giveup timeslices.

April 19, 1994  JES

-	Rob's pktdrvr enhancements. Ready for testing.
	rnzll3!pe1chl!rob@relay.NL.net. Should be possible 
	to run different stacks on this one. Doesnot require 
	loading linpkt.

-	Lutz's latest kernel.diff + patches.

	to danpop@cernapo.cern.ch (Dan Pop)
-	Broke sigsegv() out of cpu.c into just sigsegv.c as to compile
	do_int(), inb/outb(), et al inline now needs a 6meg swap on

	bios routines access to ports.

-	Fixing Keyboard int15 4f to return AH=0x86. This fixes 
	WordPerfect HOME key problem, and nothing else :-(.

February 1, 1994	macleajb@ednet.ns.ca

-	First layer of terminfo patches in from Corey 
	(corey@amiganet.chi.il.us)

-	Mouse now closes/opens on VC switches. I can now use X and a
	mouse in DOSEMU. Serial is still buggy though.

-	gorden@jegnixa.hsc.missouri.edu only came on stream less than
	a month ago and has already added a pktdriver interface. Could
	we have another Robert S. here?

-	dos_helper() int 0xe5 changed to 0xe6 to allow my FCB program
	Direct Access to work.

-	FCB callouts added to redirector. Lahey Fortran now works,
	as dos Direct Access.

-	Tim_R_Bird@Novell.COM IPX has been added to dosemu. What's
	Tim's next surprise?

-	Tim fixed LREDIR.EXE so that emufs.sys no longer has to
	be loaded once at boot.

-	Tim fixed an error in SIGSTACK.

-	Int15 0xc0 callout has been modified to deal with DOS programs
	wishing to override scan codes going into the KBD buffer. Still
	needs work.

-	Allow USAGE to display before default stderr redirection.

-	Made dos auto-redirect to stderr if no redirection given on
	command line.

-	Added simple saytime() function to display message and CLOCK
	time.

-	Modified hard_int routine many times to try and make int 9, as
	well as other ints stay serial and yet nt have to wait for
	program to return to return_address.

-	Added Corey@amiganet.chi.il.us patches to exchange 
	stderr <-> stdout. This is to prepare for terminfo.

-	Indented all source code according to INDENT.PRO.

-	Deleted int16 function.

-	Added dpmi/dpmi.h include for interrupts.

-	Added code to allow int09 (keyboard) to allow another interrupt by using
 	outb(20) called by dos programs.
 
-	Modified inline int09 to pass ALL keys to int15-4f function.

-	Added a far return for DPMI call to go protected.

-	Removed old int16 function.

-	Changed int08 inside of do_int() to return after being called.

-	EMS is very close to full 4.0 specs. I've taken the need for
	patching the kernel out at this time so that more folks will
	test EMS. Unfortunately it is horribly slow. Many thanks to
	mikebat@netcom.com (Mike Batchelor).

-	(Theadore Ts'o's)tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU created the booton bootoff
	patch. Now a user can boot from a bootdisk a:, type diskimage, 
	and then return control of a: to /dev/fd0. Alright :-).

-	Added routine to allow Diamond Card to go graphics.

-	Much effort has been put into keyboard enhancements, 
	which have not been that fruitful. Need to have numlock off
	to cut & paste within MSDOS edit, and WordPerfect 5.1 's home
	key does not work as expected.

-	Keyboard kinda does a REAL int9.

-	Fixed UMB size 0, and move XMS edx:ebx problem.

-	Added more SS overflow checks.

-	Added call in SIGILL to check if illegal op-code is just another
	hard interrupt ending. It calls int_queue_run() and sees if such
	was the case.

-	Added WORD macro in push/pop functions.

-	Added check for DPMI far call.

-	Small ET4000 updates from info from Robert Saunders. Thanks.
	Needs more testing.

-	Redirector now truncates files properly (with fingers crossed)
	Calls to create_truncate existant files is closer to correctly
	being handled.

-	Modified findfirst/findnext routine.

-	Added 0x80 flag to tell DOS it's not lanman redirector.

-	Poor excuse for an update to work with ../NUL device. Also 
	added code to allow mfs.c properly deal the GetRedirection 
	with Novell-Lite Printers.

-	Added lredir using environment vars by 
	coosman@asterix.uni-muenster.de

Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 1993  jmaclean

-	Problem with multiple instances of emufs.sys has been destroyed
	I believe.

-	tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU (Theodore Ts'o) has added the ability
	to boot off a bootimage file as drive a:, then release drive
	a: back to dosemu as the actual /dev/fd0 via booton/bootoff
	in autoexec.bat. See ./examples/config.dist for parameters.

-	As usual the keyboard routines have been dug up more.
	Still MSDOS edit.com needs numlock off to cut&paste. ARG!
	Someone could really make my day if they pointed out what
	I'm doing wrong.

-	Added video option chipset for diamond for some diamond
	cards, specifically Diamond Speedstar 24x with a 
	Paradise/Western Digital chipset. Many thanks to
	patrickm@gas.uug.arizona for putting up with me.
	This does no more than allow 'graphics' for
	this card type.

-	Overhauled EMS to allow it to work with programs that I
	use. It nolonger requires the mmap.diff patch, so please
	don't use it. I'm just carrying it along because the way Robert
	did EMS mapping was better, and I hope to move back to that
	after folks start beating this version around a bit.

-	Debugged XMS a bit more to work with UMB's and passing the
	correct XMS address for XMS moves.

-	Some more messing with ET4000, thanks to Robert alias 
	Nils Rennebarth for the ET4000 stuff. Unfortunately I am
	in need of another tester to start relaying bugs. Any takers?

-	Diffed in patch[1-3]_against_pl3.dif applied:
	-	First patch fixed a timer problem mainly.
	-	Second patch limited VC switching to left alt key.
	-	Third patch almost finishes my changes in keyboard
		routines.

-	coosman@asterix.uni-muenster.de submitted patches to mfs.c
          which allow lredir to access environment variables like are
          now used in emufs.sys.

-	coosman@asterix.uni-muenster.de fixed the 15 character limit
 	  on keybaords, some keyboard extenders should now work, 
	  yes :-).

-	coosman@asterix.uni-muenster.de also submitted dumpconf.asm
          to try and fix the multiple emufs.sys instance problem.
	  Still unsuccessful, any takers?

-	Changed dosvga.h to video.h

-	tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU (Theodore Ts'o) aided in getting mfs.c
	to do the ftruncate thing more like DOS. Still not sure if
	it's up to the full 100%.

Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 1993  jmaclean

* Another update of multiple bugfixes :-).

	- Keyboard internals have been really rearranged. I'm not sure I'm
	  keeping them this way, but now cut&paste problems should hopefully
	  go away. Also any program that looked at the bios memory for 
	  checking ctrl-alt-shift statuses have a better chance of operating.
          Still seems to be some lagging (somewhere).

	- German keyboard patches thanks to hein@tlaloc.in.tu-clausthal.de
	  (Jochen Hein) which should fix that multiple alt key problem a 
	  couple people have asked about, as well as some incorrect mappings.

	- As always mfs.c has been updated again to react to another funny
	  one on DOS's part. If a file was open write, and actually written to,
	  it should be O_TRUNC first. If its just opened for writing, and not 
	  actually written to, the file should exist as was when closed. ARG!
	  The fix is a kludge, and needs some work!

	- Ross Biro <bir7@leland.Stanford.EDU> gives us some more fixes for
	  the redirector, and includes a new toy/option for emufs.sys. Now
	  in you config.sys you can add a device statement like:
		- device=c:\emufs.sys \${HOME}/dosstuff
	  which will allow you to use your home directory as part of the
	  path. Any environment variable can be used.

	- alan@spri.levels.unisa.edu.au (Alan Modra) fixed some flag setting
	  problems in the emulated int13 code.

	- bde@kralizec.zeta.org.au (Bruce Evans) noticed some initilization
	  problems as did -

	- alan@spri.levels.unisa.edu.au (Alan Modra), so we have changes to 
	  the registers at boot time, good for some disks that need everything
	  just right :-).

	- And not to forget fin!chip@dg-rtp.dg.com (Chip Salzenberg) who got
	  rid of those annoying errors when bison was running.

	- Makefile has been altered hopefully to cleanup those 'separator
	  missing messages'.

	- parse/parse.c will not be contained in the distribution and should
	  limit that parse.tab.h not found error.

* From announce0.49pl2

	- This release has some important changes, actually bug fixes, and some
	new functionality to emufs.sys. (The hardrive redirector) It allows
	us to redirect the redirected drives using a DOS program LREDIR after
	booting, thanks to Tim Bird (Tim_R_Bird@Novell.COM) .
	 
	- Video switching is still growing, and has had some fixes for Trident
	cards, as well as changing routines for saving and restoring video
	memory above the first bank. ET4000 code is still giving some problems
	so be aware. 

	- Keyboard control has been enhanced using a real time int16 interrupt.
	Thanks Tim. This is important for WordPerfect users, Dosshell,
	Qbasic, and many other problems that have been attributed to keyboard
	problems. This has not been proved to fix the 1 key behind problem
	yet.:-(

	- Sdh@po.cwru.edu (Scott D. Heavner) has allowed us to specify an
	alternate config file using dos -F'filename' etc with his patches.

	- A problem writing files in WordPerfect on emufs.sys drives has been
	irraticated. 

	- Dir listings that included the volume label attribute were only 
	returning the volume label, and no dir listing. Fixed. Thanks to
	karel@obelix.icce.rug.nl.

	- Finally the keyboard problem has had another important fix thanks to
	ronnie@lysator.liu.se (ronnie s.) via Robert (gt8134b@prism.gatech.edu)
	that should fix the keyboard behind by 1 problem.

Tue Jul 13 19:54:13 1993  rsanders

	* Makefile: cleanups...

Tue Jul 13 19:24:54 1993  root

	* cpu.c, cpu.h, emu.c:
	changes for using the new (0.99pl10) signal stacks

Wed Jul  7 21:44:51 1993  root

	* emu.c: hook for parse_config(name);

	* parse.c:
	added support for ~/.dosrc and parse_config() now takes a filename
	argument to override .dosrc check.

Mon Jun  7 20:26:09 1993    (root@hrothgar)

	* emu.c (char_out): more BIOS-like handling of int
	0x29...character attributes are now reserved, and scrollup now
	uses the attribute from the previous char (needs more work).

Fri Jun  4 01:43:39 1993    (root@hrothgar)

	* cpu.c (find_port): added Andrew's patches diff1-6, which include
	the maskable port I/O.  Began fixes to allow ports beyond 0x3ff.

Thu Jun  3 23:05:26 1993    (root@hrothgar)

	* emu.c (ms_dos): fixed up the EmuSys and EmuBat directives.  They
	now take string arguments.

Thu May 27 21:38:08 1993    (root@hrothgar)

	* bios_emm.c (bios_emm_init): moved into dosipc.c: memory_setup().
	Now checks that /proc/self/mem is mmap()able, and turns off EMS
	support if it isn't.

Wed May 26 01:09:23 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* moved 0xE000 segment routines to 0xF000.  also changed reboot
	code to use inte5, ax=0xffff

Tue May 25 01:41:53 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added early support for the EmuSys and EmuBat directives, which
	remap CONFIG.SYS to CONFIG.EMU and AUTOEXEC.BAT to AUTOEXEC.EMU.
	This works now, but I'm not sure when I should disable it.

Mon May 24 21:50:33 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added CMOS checksum.

	* dosemu 0.49 released!

Fri May 14 00:41:08 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* cleaned up the int10h ah=9/0xA calls...they now work correctly
	except for possible bounds checking.

	* made floppies safe, but slow...work on this.

Wed May  5 02:18:23 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added mouse support and console switching even in graphics
	mode.

Tue Apr 20 00:49:07 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added DMSG_PAUSE for pausing the parent...

	* fixed a lot of int10() problems, including cursor positioning
	and int10h 0xa/0x9.

Fri Apr 16 08:58:43 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added VGA BIOS support...user vgaon.com to allow it, vgaoff.com
	to stop it. 

Wed Apr 14 03:44:36 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* now have mfs.c updated all the way to diff9, which has multiple
	drive support...(not my doing!).  also translated linux.asm into
	emufs.S. 

Mon Apr 12 22:08:39 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added the 1-second tick in dosipc.c.  the child gets a SIGALRM
	every second, which child_tick() handles.  currently only calls
	print_tick(). 

Tue Apr  6 00:20:05 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* stold the Mach DOS emulator's UMB routines. PCShell no longer
	crashes, PKZIP now uses it.  PKZIP 2.04e won't use EMS :-( and
	neither will debug.

	* ported bios_emm.c (EMS emulation) from the Mach DOS emulator. It
	relies on my kernel hack of mmap(/dev/selfmem). Works pretty well,
	emulates EMS version 3.2.

	* applied diff1,diff2,and diff3 from Andrew Tridgell. MFS works
	better, faster.  MFS also adjusts for being run suid root.  The
	default interrupt (0xfe) conflicts with Turbo Debugger.  I suggest
	a change to 0xe5.

Thu Apr  1 03:08:22 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* translated the bootsect.S code for as86.  This is nice for
	general interest, and for the distribution hdimage (which requires
	fdisk /mbr to fix it, by the way).

Wed Mar 31 01:00:37 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* integrated Andrew Tridgell's port of the Mach mfs redirector.
	Seems to work okay, if not blazingly fast.  Sure beats linux.exe.

	* changed VIRT_SCREEN_BASE and INIT_VIDEO_MODE for MDA to actually
	show MDA mode 7 and base of 0xb0000.

	* added PARTITION type.  only works with /dev/hd?1. relies upon
	the file "/etc/dosemu/partition" to be the first sector (Master
	Boot Record) of /dev/hd?.  

Tue Mar 30 02:51:33 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* changed disks.c a lot, added the IMAGE file header code (to
	auto-detect geometry from an image file).

Mon Mar 29 00:47:41 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added the int 0x2f, ax=0x1680 "give up time slice" function.
	does a usleep()...is this best?  thanks to Andrew Tridgell.

	* changed disks.c to simply accept FLOPPY_A as defined

	* changed -f option to take an argument

Sun Mar 28 02:07:50 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* wrote dosconfig.c to replace dosconfig.sh.  

	* changed the int16h ah=0x55 to return eax=0 for MS-WORD 5 (check
	this with Andrew Tridgell). 

	* fixed up some of the CONFIGURATION (int 11h value) stuff.  see
	emu.c, config_init()

Mon Mar  8 00:37:07 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added dosconfig.sh for "make config", rearranged Makefile to be
	a little safer.  It tries to keep the user's config.h updated, but
	not to recompile too often.  (dosconfig.sh uses awk)

	* cleaned up get_video_ram()...Turbo debugger 3.0 now works, at
	least the video stuff does.

	* added some fixes so that leavedos() will timeout after 3
	seconds or so, but I still need to find out why/where it hangs.

	* added memory.h and video.c.  added "make dep" to Makefile.

Sun Mar  7 15:05:10 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added an ugly hack for multiple screen pages...nasty. works okay
	for Turbo Debugger 1.0, though.  also began marking hacks with
	XXX...most everything new&old is a hack, sadly enough.  termio.c &
	emu.c need to be robbed of the screen functions, which will be put
	in screen.c. also the emu.h and termio.h headers...clean the
	get_video_ram & put_video_ram stuff...

Thu Mar  4 01:23:04 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added the proper set-iflag-after-instruction STI emulation.  it
	doesn't seem worth it, so I disabled it be default (define
	PROPER_STI in cpu.c or the Makefile to get it working).

	* got the HMA working perfectly.  moved the IPC_RMIDs into
	memory_shutdown(), called by stop_dosipc, so that the HMA area,
	which isn't always attached, wouldn't go away unexpectedly.

	* used krishna's new ipcdelta stuff (the SHM_REMAP flag) to make
	the low page shared, too. I should break this out of the main
	segment1. verified that it works.

	* added SIGCHLD handler, fixed up the DMSG_ACK situation. still
	need to design a rational, interrupt-like protocol for this.

	* added shared memory to dosemu. I haven't gotten Krishna's new
	stuff yet, so I don't share the first page (I NEED TO!). 2 segments,
	one from 0x1000-0x9ffff, the other 0xc0000-0xfffff.  Because of
	stupid mmap(), I can't share the segment from 0xa0000-0xbffff, as
	mmap() needs memory under, and IPC can't have memory under.

Tue Mar  2 02:07:57 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* apparently, whatever badness in DOS 5.0 that caused the SIGSEGV
	when booting has gone away, or I've fixed it, so I took the
	boot_in_progress checks out (partially, I'm a little wary).  We'll
	see how it goes.

	* made the child process munmap() everything from page 2 (address
	4096) to the page before LIBSTART.  this should cut down on memory
	usage a little, as well as make attaching shm a little easier.
	still doesn't fix first page problem, but Krishna is doing that.

	* changed the format of the DOS HELPER function to show interrupts
	(now takes low int in BH,high int in BL).  Also added a parameter
	to show_ints(). also added -2 option for 80286 flags emulation.
	(real-mode 80286 keeps upper 4 flag bits (15,14,13,12) clear.

	* added two new switches, -3 and -4, that allow you to choose 386
	or 486 "emulation"...this currently only changes the behavior of
	the AC (alignment check) bit of EFLAGS, but since that IS the
	Intel-recommended test...I need to add emulation for BSWAP, XADD,
	and CMPXCHG instructions for 386 users running in 486 mode (just for
	kicks :-). I wonder if PKZIP 2.04 is much faster in 386/486 mode...

Mon Mar  1 01:35:53 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added code to keep virtual IOPL, NT, bit15 of eflags register.
	this means I also have to interpret the 0x66 and 0x67 instruction
	prefixes (32-bit operand and address, respectively).  this must be
	done in sigsegv()...it's just ignored now

	* split dosemu into 2 processes, one of which currently only
	monitors keypresses.  I use UNIX domain sockets--pipe() returns a
	uni-directional pipe :-(

	* tried to speed up clear_screen() for non-console video.

Thu Feb 25 21:19:10 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* fixed show_regs() to display an iflag-adjusted eflags.  I should
	make access functions to _regs.eflags so that "virtualized" bits
	are always handled correctly.

	* fixed iflag/IF handling...Matthias had forgotten to adjust iflag
	on popf and iret. Silly boy.  I wasn't doing much better, testing
	IF directly from the _regs.eflags after return from vm86(), which
	of course corresponded to the system IF...someone should write a
	virtual-8086 mode tutorial!

Wed Feb 24 11:33:59 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* fixed the key-repeat bug.

Tue Feb 23 01:36:17 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* well, the ugliness with indirect far calling can be
	skipped...however, I can only get pcshell to work with the mouse,
	and it doesn't use callbacks!  added lctrl+rctrl+capslock = toggle
	kayboard mouse...arrow keys are direction, home is left and end
	is right button.

	* made the first brain-dead changes for mouse support.

Mon Feb 22 16:26:17 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* cleaned up the show_regs() a bit, better display of flags, shows
	10 bytes before and after CS:EIP.

	* added the define FAST_BUT_WRONG29, which, if defined, makes
	int29 fast char output faster, but makes programs that hook int29
	fail.  ANSI.SYS is one of these.  I leave FAST_... defined, as
	ANSI.SYS doesn't work now anyway.

	* added the extended (32-bit) XMS 3.0 API.  cleaned up xms.c to be
	a little more 32-bit clean (i.e. doesn't fudge upper 16 bits of
	register if it's not supposed to).  Added the macros LWORD() and
	HWORD() to emu.h...

Sat Feb 20 17:43:50 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added Bill Bogstad's (bogstad@cs.jhu.edu)
	auto-hd-geometry-detect code.  It seems to work okay.

Thu Feb 18 01:38:21 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* RELEASE: released these changes as 0.48.patch1.  Peter Macdonald
	(pmacdona@sanjuan.uvic.ca) says he'll incorporate this into his SLS.

	* changes NUM_HANDLES for XMS to 64. took out handle_mask.

	* added the screen-buffer-and-compare code to restore_screen().
	this ought to really speed up the non-console users

Wed Feb 17 15:40:54 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* fixed up the Makefile to make libemu start at 1 GB... this is
	really really important, as the dosemu0.48 distribution's MAX_XMS
	of 3072 could overrun into libemu...I don't know why it works this
	way, but it does (actually, I do know why, I just don't know why
	sbrk() lets you move into a shared lib).  Anyway, now xms.c checks
	that you have space left for MAX_XMS (at compile time, will have
	to be dynamic-ized to run time XMS size setting)

	* removed the check for console_keyb before calling
	PollKeyboard...non-console users deserve a keyboard, too!

Tue Feb 16 00:29:58 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* cmos RTC now returns values in BCD if appropriate (usually is)

	* fixed the keypad number keys.  forgot to put scancode in upper
	byte. also fixed the F11 and F12 keys.

	* added man page, and the rest is history.
	  DOSEMU 0.48 DISTRIBUTION

Mon Feb 15 00:24:50 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added all the ctrl and alt cursor keys.

	* added the files cmos.c and cmos.h.  these will eventually
	contain all the CMOS values needed and provide CMOS real-time
	clock and alarm support.  current code covers time/date, disk
	setup, memory size, CMOS status.

Sun Feb 14 16:50:28 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* put the special_nowait call into read Extended keycode also.
	I've really gotta verify this.

Sat Feb 13 15:26:20 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* uh, fixed the XMS EMB alloc. problem.  I swear I checked for
	this when I first had problems, but apparently not...I was
	malloc()ing the actual K size, instead of the K size * 1024.

	* added some XMS functions, made the XMSControl entry point
	conform to the spec (for hookability).

Fri Feb 12 14:19:30 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* put the 101-key keyboard flag in the BIOS

	* Added the timer_tick() routine. this fixes a LOAD of
	stuff...4DOS beep lockup, 4HELP, Norton utilities, checkit,
	autocnf, bunches and bunches of stuff, basically.  This still
	needs a LOT of work, like keeping track of round off error, higher
	frequency, but it'll do for now.

Thu Feb 11 01:53:27 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* changed ReadString to accept almost any characters.  I'm still
	not sure about the ones below space.

	* char_out now treats \n as \n\r.  I wonder about this.  also,
	ctrl-c checking is done a little more properly (look for dos_ctrlc())

	* added the hold-alt-and-type keypad numbers entry method.  still
	need to add alt/shift/ctrl-cursor keys.

Wed Feb 10 13:08:05 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* WordPerfect works perfectly now :-). almost.

	* added Rshift-scrlock for int8, lshift-scrlock for int9.  funny
	thing is, these work better than the flags.  makes me wonder about
	the whole signal handler thing, and maybe I should check the IF.

	* added the -K flag.  sorta makes QBASIC/EDIT work.  if I use the
	-t switch (timer int), then msdos will crash eventually with a GP
	fault on 0xe8.

Tue Feb  9 15:45:54 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* XMS can now allocate the HMA and a single UMB at 0xc000.  I
	really need to make sure that 0xc000 isn't BIOS-mapped, but I'm
	just playing now, anyway.  This is fun!  I can put dos=high,umb in
	my config.sys and get 702K posible executable size! (with -m 720)

	* began the XMS stuff.  Have a driver that can mark its presence
	and claim no HMA. :-) 

	* fixed the dir /w problem by allowing int 21h to do its own char
	out.  however, I found an anomaly in the get video combination
	code.  I can return 4 (color EGA), but not 8 (color VGA).  If I
	do, qedit freaks and puts the menu up off the screen as if the video
	memory started at 0xb000:0000.  The same thing happens if I change
	BL in video subsystem.

Mon Feb  8 02:05:07 1993    (root at hrothgar)

        * this (or herabouts) is RELEASE 0.47.7

	* fixed the heavy-load miss characters thing.  The keybuffer code
	Stephen Tweedie gave me would advance the buffer even if ReadKeyboard
	was called with wait=TEST.

Fri Feb  5 01:51:08 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* okay, fixed the lost characters thing for real: Matthias' int29h
	handler (fast DOS tty output) was calling int 10h/ah=e.  int 29h
	output always goes to the current screen, and Matthias wasn't
	taking that into account.

Thu Feb  4 00:35:57 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* i know why...I'm doing that damn WAITACTIVE ioctl(). damn damn
	damn! I see no way around that. (later note: it might in fact
	be the fact that I was often deleting libemu out from under
	dosemu's feet with rm -f, and now that I've stopped that,
	everything's better. Should I keep the ioctl queue?)

	* well, it seems that my ioctl queue hasn't stopped the kernel
	panics. here's what I get (raw keyboard mode):
 general protection: 0000
 EIP:    0008:00047325
 EFLAGS: 00010286
 fs: 0017
 base: 00000000, limit: C0000000
 Pid: 464, process nr: 16
 64 88 08 4e 85 ed 74 13 8b 15 
 
 wait_queue is bad (eip = 00000201)
         q = 0017b864
        *q = 00236f6c
       tmp = 00236f6c

(repeat the wait_queue block 7 times)

 Unable to handle kernel paging request at address c0000004
 Oops: 0000
 EIP:    0008:0004748B
 EFLAGS: 00010093

 Pid: 31, process nr: 8
 39 50 04 75 f8 8b 4c 24 1c 89 

	* well, pkzip 2.04e uses int10h/ah=e with a seemingly random
	screen page.  PC-DOS 4.01 seems to do the same thing. so, in my
	infinite wisdom, if it writes to a screen page > 7, i make it
	write to the current screen page.  this is probably wrong, but it
	works for pkzip 2.04e.

	* fixed the PollKeyboard() thing, I think.  I use a "queue" for
	ioctl()'s started from within an interrupt handler.  this is
	nasty, but it'll have to do.  I can make this a lot pretier.

	* AAARRRRRGH! PollKeyboard() was crashing the emulator (kernel
	panics and such) because I was using select()...and looky here,
	pg. 278 of the Stevens book, select() is NOT listed as one of the
	reentrant functions.  I'm a fool. A FOOL, I tell you!

	* these changes I will call dosemu0.47.5

	* also added choice of PHANTOMDIR and VIDEO_CARD to the Makefile.
	VIDEO_CARD only has effect if it is set to MDA: the
	PHYS_SCREEN_BASE will then be set to 0xb0000 instead of 0xb8000.

	* Now you can choose your RAW keyboard nationality in the Makefile
	(like with a kernel compile).  Gotta clean this up later with a
	keymaps subdir, and all the keymaps therein.  Also noticed that
	when 4dos freezes up during a beep, ctrl-break (in RAW mode, of
	course), fixes it :-).  Added these keys to RAW (-k) mode:
	   ctrl-alt-pgup  ... exit the emulator
	   ctrl-alt-pgdn  ... "reboot" the emulator (not recommended)
	   ctrl-break     ... as in DOS
	   ctrl-scrollock ... show first 0x30 interrupt vectors
	   alt-scrollock  ... show registers
	for some reason, keypad cursor keys (pgup/pgdn/delete) when
	combined with the ctrl-alt keys will cause nasty things to happen.
	Things like kernel panics, hard system reboots, etc.  Is this my
	fault, or Linux's? (I'm sure it's mine, but I can't figure out how)

Wed Feb  3 12:07:16 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* Added some elementary key-polling in sigalrm() with
	PollKeyboard(). This works okay for now, but I really need to make
	in general purpose (not just for console_keyb) and make the key
	buffer use the BDA for real. Then we've got keyboard about done,
	except for the multi-national keyboard maps.

	* Added Stephen Tweedie's small patches for insert-key into
	keyboard buffer (InsKeyboard).  This needs to be rewritten to use
	the real BDA queue.

	* made the parse-debugflags kinda recursive, so a and 0 don't
	terminate the parsing.  This allows for handy option strings like
	"-a+v" or "0+v" for debugging just video.  

Tue Feb  2 15:21:59 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* note that DOSKEY works now! Nathan says it didn't before.  Oh,
	well. I thought it didn't.

	* cleaned up the debug-msg flags a bit.  now the -D option
	specifies a list of options.  also cleaned up the int-revectoring
	a tad.  moved a little of the stuff into emu.h (a lot more needs
	to go)

	* added the -f option to flip A: and B: floppies.  I also have the
	-B flag to boot from the b: drive, but I don't think DOS will ever
	be happy with that.  might take it out before release.

Mon Feb  1 23:53:52 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* NEED to find out what int 16h/ah=0x55 does.  it seems to control
	timeout for get_char (int 16h/ah=1), and is necessary for dosshell
	and qbasic (which freeze occasionally otherwise).

	* added some wacky int-revectoring code.  all but int 16h is broke
	right now, and that is even special-case, too.

Wed Jan 27 00:21:06 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* fixed problem with CloseKeyboard() sometimes restoring flags
	that had never been read.  now, kbd_fd==-1 at startup, as it should.

	* fixed time problem - now DOS time is set properly at boot to be
	in sync w/Linux's clock.  After that, DOS can change it.

	* moved the port_[out,in] functions to emu.h

	* fixed a problem in get_leds() arising from the fact that &= is
	not the same operator as &. silly me.  now it works.

Tue Jan 26 16:48:31 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* well, had to put ioperm()s to disable the emulator's I/O
	permissions before I re-enter the vm86() call. (of course, the
	vm86 "task" inherits the emulator's ioperms).  This means that if
	I'm not careful, I may leave an I/O port open to DOS :-(.

	* Added two options: -N exits the emulator before booting DOS (but
	after all the initialization), and -V allows VGA video.  This
	presently only includes the changing of the blink attribute bit to
	the high intensity background bit, but it will one day also enable
	VGA graphics.

Mon Jan 25 22:19:20 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* the linux.exe problem was found: linux.exe will fail if there
	are more than 2 floppy drives defined.  i defaulted the number of
	floppies and hard drives to 2 each; this is changeable by the -H
	and -F options.

Thu Jan 21 21:10:06 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* filled the highscan[] table for all chars <= 0x80 (ASCII).  the
	rest are alt-chars (from a terminal's point of view, META at least).

	* note that the below change required that I no longer open
	/dev/tty, but use STDIN_FILENO and dup() that.  whatever that implies.

	* fixed the console-video/keyb code.  dosemu can now detect if you
	are on a console, and refuse to run if not.  it also retrieves the
	console number for future use. (very system-dependent checking of the
	major/minor numbers! this is dangerous! if dev_t changes from 16
	bits, this breaks.)  console_video console switching should now be
	completely safe, thanks to WAITACTIVE.  currently, it blocks until
	the dos console is current.  I might want to change this so that
	it just doesn't map it if the console isn't current--using
	GETSTATE (and wait for later acquire_vt() calls to do so.)]

	* made the int13 disk-sensing functions more sensible. also made
	the dp->tracks, dp->heads stuff orthogonal (for some reason,
	matthias had made exceptions for floppys??).  You can now
	format/unformat a floppy, as well as a floppy disk image. added a
	default CMOS type to the disk table struct.

Sat Jan 16 10:28:23 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* fixed alt-numkey bug in termio.c.  for some reason, alt-numkey
	scancodes get bumped up by 0x76. also fixed alt-- and alt-=

	* can't find bug that causes repeated extended keystrokes to kill
	the emulator: to find it, run tv.com on some file, go the bottom,
	and press & hold pgdn.  bam, crash.

	* fixed int21h, ah=1,7,or 8 problem with extended keycodes;
          (was supposed to return 0 first, then scancode on next call).
