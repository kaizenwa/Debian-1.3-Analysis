This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------

The obsolete variable "countdown_rate" is still in use within "atari_amiga.c"
this should be a trivial change. I'm reluctant to do this change without
an Amiga to check it. I've left it defined in "atari.c" so that there are
no linker errors on the Amiga.
