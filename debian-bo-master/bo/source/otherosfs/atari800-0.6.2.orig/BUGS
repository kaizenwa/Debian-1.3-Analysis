Bugs and Known Problems
-----------------------

2. A few programs cause the emulator to enter its built in debugger. The
   reason for this is unknown at the moment. It might be use of undocumented
   instructions. (Atari Tennis)

8. Player/Missiles are not displayed over a GTIA [sub]playfield -
   Not really a bug since its not been implemented yet!

9. The Linux XVIEW (a.out) version generates a segmentation faults when
   linked with the Network Audio System. The fault occurs simply by
   linking the NAS routines with the XVIEW version, you do not even
   need to execute a single line of code added to support sound. At the
   moment I believe that this is a conflict between the current version
   of XVIEW I am using (XVIEW 3.2 Linux Rel. 5 + X11R6) and the Network
   Audio System. XVIEW and NAS work OK together under Solaris and
   Linux/ELF.
