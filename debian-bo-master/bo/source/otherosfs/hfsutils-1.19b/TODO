General to-do items (aka bugs):

  libhfs

  * Bad block sparing for hfs_format().
  * Concurrency considerations: opening same file multiple times;
      performing directory manipulations on open files.
  * B*-tree record balancing?
  * Smarter block allocation algorithm.
  * Volume full: hfs_write() should return bytes written < len, return -1
      on next call?
  * Seek beyond end of file?
  * Touch directory timestamps on file updates?
  * Glob hcopy destination HFS path?
  * Nulls in filenames.
  * Non-standard block sizes?

  command-line tools / Tcl tools

  * Interactive mode (-i) for hdel.
  * htouch?
  * Glob :*:foo correctly.
  * Formalize hdisk.pl into the distribution.

  xhfs

  * Open arbitrary partitions.
  * Rename volumes.
  * Change file type/creator.

  copyin/copyout

  * Don't unconditionally clobber.
  * Delete incomplete files after failed transfers.
  * AppleSingle, Netatalk-/CAP-style AppleDouble?

Future wish-list:

  * Partitioning utility.
  * Defragmenting utility.
