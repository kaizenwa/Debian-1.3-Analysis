.SH NAME
hfssh \- Tcl interpreter with HFS extensions
.SH SYNOPSIS
hfssh
.RI [ script ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hfssh
is a Tcl interpreter like tclsh(1) but which implements two extra commands:
.SP
.TP
.BI ctime " timestamp"
This command returns a date string representation of the given calendar time
value, as per the ctime(3) C library function.
.TP
.BR hfs " mount|format|flushall|version|copyright|author|license"
This command introduces all of the possible top-level HFS operations.
.SH SEE ALSO
hfsutils(1), hfs(1)
.SH NOTES
Precautions are taken to ensure all open files and mounted volumes are cleanly
closed and unmounted before exiting the shell, however abnormal termination
(e.g. CTRL-C) can circumvent this, potentially leaving volumes in an
inconsistent state. Judicious use of `hfs flushall' may help reduce this risk.
.SH BUGS
Tcl does not provide a mechanism for manipulating arbitrary binary data.
Therefore caution should be used when reading or writing files containing
anything other than plain text.
