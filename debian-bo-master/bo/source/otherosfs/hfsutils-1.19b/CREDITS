The HFS globbing code was inspired by similar code to perform filename
globbing in Tcl by John Ousterhout.

The code to perform BinHex encoding/decoding is based on the definition of
BinHex 4.0 as written by Peter N Lewis.

The code for `hls' is loosely based on the GNU implementation of `ls'.

And thanks of course to the engineers of the truly fascinating HFS filesystem
for giving me a challenge. May your extents overflow file never become so
fragmented that you cannot locate its own extents.
