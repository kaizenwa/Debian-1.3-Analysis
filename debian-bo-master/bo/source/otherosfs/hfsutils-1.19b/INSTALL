Instructions for installing this package:

  0. If you want to build the Tcl interface and the Tk-based graphical
     interface, ensure that you have Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2 installed on your
     system. (With other versions, your mileage may vary.)

  1. Edit the Makefile. You should only need to edit the first section.

     - DESTDIR should be set to the directory root where files should be
       installed. You can change this and/or BINDEST, MANDEST, LIBDEST, and
       INCDEST to select directories for installation. These directories
       should already exist on your filesystem (they won't be created).

       You can ignore the LIBDEST and INCDEST definitions if you aren't
       going to install the development library and header include file.

     - MANEXT should be set to the extension to use for the manual pages.

     - If your operating system does not support fcntl-style locking on
       device files, you may want to add -DNODEVLOCKS to the DEFINES. Keep
       in mind, without locking support a volume can be corrupted by these
       tools if two or more processes manipulate it at the same time.

     - If you want to build the Tcl/Tk tools, make sure the right includes
       and libraries are selected to compile with Tcl, Tk, and X. Note that
       the -ltcl7.6 library on my system requires -ldl as well; that may or
       may not also be true for your system.

  2. Build the desired tools:

     - To build the command-line tools, type:  make all_cli
     - To build the Tcl/Tk tools, type:        make all_tcl

     - To build everything, just type:  make

  3. (Optional) Test the programs before they are installed.

  4. Install the desired files:

     - To install the command-line tools, type:   make install_cli
     - To install the Tcl/Tk tools, type:         make install_tcl
     - To install the development library, type:  make install_lib

     - To install everything except the library, just type:  make install

  5. (Optional) Type:  make clean
