This directory contains various fixes, hints etc. which are specific
to certain products/situations but which are not really problems with
the iBCS emulator or fixable in it.

  The presence of files here should not be taken to imply that problems
actually exist with any product, nor should they be taken to imply
that anyone supports the product under Linux.
