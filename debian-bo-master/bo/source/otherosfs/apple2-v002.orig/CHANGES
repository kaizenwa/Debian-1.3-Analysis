Changes in 0.02: (8 Dec 1995)

  * Ctrl-C will not kill the emulator with newer SVGAlib.  Please
    use SVGAlib > 1.2.9 for best results.
  
  * Rudimentory REPT key handling.  It's too fast though.
  
  * The assembler files now compiles under ELF.
  
  * Not every SVGA card can do page-flipping.  The emulator now
    checks for this and fall back to VGA if it can't.

  * Keymap has changed a bit.  Backspace and ']' is now <-, '[' is
    REPT.

  * Disk extension changed to the more common .dsk (and a2d.info to
    dsk.info).

Changes in 0.01: (9 Oct 1994)

  * Standard VGA support with some performance degradation.
    (When page flipping occurs, 64K memory banks are swapped;
     hence the performance degradation.)

  * -vga flag switch added, e.g. "apple2 -vga"; forces standard
    VGA detection.

  * (Trident) TVGA8900 page flipping bug fixed.

  * File names may now contain any character codes. (The previous
    version had some problems with compressing/uncompressing file
    names with extraordinary characters.)

  * Diskette selection retains last cursor position.
