LXtools
is a set of utilities that let you access files and directories on the
HP100LX and HP200LX palmtop computers using a serial line. In order to use
the LX tools, you need to connect your palmtop with the Unix machine using a
serial cable. Then, you have to launch Filer on the palmtop and adjust the
communication options in the "Communications/Remote Settings..." dialog
of Filer to 38400 baud, Com1 and server mode enabled. That's it.

.I lxdir
displays the contents of a directory on the palmtop.
.I lxcopy
copies one or more files from the Unix system to the palmtop or
the other way round.
.I lxdel
deletes a file on the palmtop.
.I lxmkdir
creates a new directory on the palmtop. If you tell it to create
a:/b/c/d/e/f and any of the directories b, c, d or e do not exist,
it creates them on the fly.
.I lxrmdir
deletes a directory on the palmtop.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
-1, -2, -3 ... -8
sets serial line 1, 2, 3 ... 8, respectively. Default is -1.
.TP
.B -b <baudrate>
sets the baud rate to <baudrate>. Default is 38400.
.TP
.B -r
tells lxcopy to recursively enter directories and, thus, copy
all files in all subdirectories too.
.TP
.B -a
tells lxcopy to only copy files from the LX that have the archive
bit set. The archive bit is set whenever you modify a file. It can
be cleared using the ATTRIB command (see ATTRIB /?). 
.TP
.B -o
tells lxcopy to not overwrite already existing files when copying
from the LX.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B
lxdir c:/_dat
displays the contents of the C:\\_DAT directory of the palmtop.
.TP
.B
lxdir "c:/_dat/*.env"
displays all .ENV files in the C:\\_DAT directory. Note that quotes
are needed so that the wildcards are not expanded locally.
.TP
.B
lxcopy a:/bin/gaga.com gugu.com
copies the file A:\\BIN\\GAGA.COM from the palmtop to the current
directory of the Linux system and names it 'gugu.com'
.TP
.B
lxcopy a:/bin/gaga.com .
copies the file  A:\\BIN\\GAGA.COM from the palmtop to the current
directory of the Linux system and names it 'GAGA.COM'
.TP
.B
lxcopy a:/bin .
copies all files from the A:\\BIN directory of the palmtop to
the current directory on the Linux system.
.TP
.B
lxcopy "a:/bin/*.com" a:/util/gaga.exe /usr/local/test
copies all .COM files from the A:\\BIN directory of the palmtop and
the file A:\\UTIL\\GAGA.EXE to the /usr/local/test directory on the
Linux system.
.TP
.B
lxcopy gaga.c a:/trash/gugu.c
copies the file gaga.c from the current directory of the Linux
system to A:\\TRASH\\GUGU.C on the palmtop.
.TP
.B
lxcopy gaga.c a:/trash
copies the file gaga.c from the current directory of the Linux
system to A:\\TRASH\\GAGA.C on the palmtop.
.TP
.B
lxcopy ../*.c *.c c:/src
copies all .c files in the current directory and the parent directory
of the Linux system to the C:\\SRC directory on the palmtop.
.TP
.B
lxcopy -r a: /usr/backup/hp/a
copies all files on drive A: to /usr/backup/hp/a and creates subdirectories
on the fly.
.TP
.B
lxcopy -r /usr/backup/hp/a a:
copies all files in all subdirectories of /usr/backup/hp/a to drive a:
and creates subdirectories on the fly.
.TP
.B
lxcopy -r -a a:/data /usr/backup/hp/a
copies all files in all subdirectories of a:\DATA that have the archive
bit set.
.TP
.B
lxdel c:/test.txt
deletes the file C:\\TEST.TXT.
.TP
.B
lxmkdir c:/gugus
creates the directory C:\\GUGUS on the palmtop.
.TP
.B
lxrmdir c:/gugus
deletes the directory C:\\GUGUS on the palmtop.

.SH NOTES

lxcopy finds out from where to where you want to copy by
looking for a ':' in the specified path. Therefore,
a path on the LX must always have a drive specified.
.PP   
All path names use the '/' character. Do not use a '\\' even for
files on the palmtop.
.PP
If you have problems with transfering files, you can try a lower
baud rate. Set your palmtop, e.g., to 19200 baud and run the
LX tools with the "-b 19200" option.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

The device name and number as well as the baud rate can be overriden
by environment variables. If these variables are set, the corresponding
command line options are ignored:
.TP
LXTOOLS_LINE
specifies the device to be used, e.g. "/dev/ttya".
.TP
LXTOOLS_BAUD
specifies the baud rate to be used, e.g. "9600".

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

If you see the message "Cannot open /dev/cua0", most probably you have no
permissions to access the serial line device. It might be owned by root and
has read/write access only by the owner for security reasons. If you do not
intend to use this serial port for logging in into your machine, just change
the permissions as root using: "chmod o+r+w /dev/cua0".
.PP
If the serial port behaves "strangely", e.g. if the permissions suddenly
are altered again or the baud rate is reset automatically, you most
likely have a "getty" running on the serial port. Check the file
/etc/inittab or /etc/ttytab. You have to either stop getty running on
that port or choose a different port for the connection to the palmtop.

.SH BUGS

Unknown. Probably none :-)
