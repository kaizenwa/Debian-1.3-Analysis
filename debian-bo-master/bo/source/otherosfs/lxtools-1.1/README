LX TOOLS 1.0a - Access files on the HP palmtops
===============================================

The LX tools are a set of commands that let you transfer files from the Unix
system to your HP palmtop and the other way round via a serial cable. They
also let you create and delete directories. On the palmtop, all you need is
the built-in Filer application. Well, and of course you also need a cable,
a palmtop and a Unix system.

NEW IN VERSION 1.0a:

- environment variables LXTOOLS_LINE and LXTOOLS_BAUD override
  command line options

- 8 serial lines are supported (instead of 4)

- all messages are written to stderr (instead of stdout) so that
  stdin/stdout can be used for data transfer.

- files copied from the LX are now (configurable) in lower case

NEW IN VERSION 1.1:

- little endians / big endians should now work both (untested)

- lxcopy can now recursively enter directories. Using this
  option, you can backup the LX with one command.

- lxcopy can be told to only copy files from the LX that have
  the archive bit set (useful for backups).

- several smaller fixes


INSTALLATION

- unpack the compressed tar file (you already did that, didn't you ;-)

- check the file "config.h". It should be OK for Linux systems,
  but might need some changes for other systems.

- if you don't have the gcc compiler, you might need to modify
  Makefile

- "make"

- if you want to save some space: "make clean"

- move "lxtools.1" to /usr/local/man/man1 or wherever you keep
  the manual pages
  
- move the executables (lxdir, lxcopy, lxdel, lxmkdir and lxrmdir)
  to where you want to keep them (probably /usr/local/bin)
  
- "man lxtools"

- don't tell me you have done *all* above steps and still need
  further instructions!
