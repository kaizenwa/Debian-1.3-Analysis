mcvert needs to be compiled before you can run it, since mcvert runs on
a wide variety of machines, each with its own binary format.

o Ready a directory to hold mcvert

	cd
	mkdir mcvert
	cp mcvert-nnn.shar mcvert
	cd mcvert

o Create the individual files from the Shell Archive (shar) file

	sh mcvert-nnn.shar

o Reorder the Makefile as appropriate for your machine

  Note that there are a number of variables with which to fiddle,
  and that the last definition wins.

  For example, when compiling for AT&T's 3B2, reorder so these lines
  are last within group:

	XOBJ= gettod.o
	
	LIBS=

	CFLAGS_M= -DTIMEVAL -DULONG

	CFLAGS_N = -DNOBYTEORDER -DNOBZEROBCOPY

o Make the binary and man page

	make

o Read the manpage for a full description

	more mcvert.man

o Invoke the binary without arguments for a short description

	mcvert
