Overview of file conversion

More details regarding file formats may be found in the mcvert.1 man
page, but basically, there are native Mac files that live (only) on
the Mac (since they have interesting internal structure), and
representations of Mac files.

One very important representation is called MacBinary.  It is nothing
but "data".  But it is 8-bit data, and that confuses some things some
times, like mail programs and modems.  So, there are encodings of
MacBinary files as ASCII only files, and one very important one is
called BinHex4.0.  So far, so good.

mcvert runs under UNIX and converts between different representations
of Mac files.  One very common conversion is between BinHex4.0 and
MacBinary.  So know we know how to do that (on a UNIX box).  On the
Mac, I prefer the CompactPro shareware for doing this conversion

A MacBinary file must be converted into the actual native Mac file it
represents.  One such program, which runs on the Mac, is binhex4.0.
Often, though, programs like telnet from NCSA, kermit, White Knight,
or any number of other communication programs will convert MacBinary
files into the native Mac files they represent during transfer.

Files can be very large, and rather redundent.  So it makes sense
to compress the files to save space and reduce transfer cost.
There are compressed file formats.  Two popular ones are StuffIt
and CompactPro.  But if a file is compressed, something must
uncompress it.  There are unstuffers and extractors, which are
separate programs which work on the compressed files.  Some files
are "self-extracting", which means the files are actually Mac
programs which, when run, recreate the original file.

Files are often identified by extensions, those .ext suffixes at the
end of the name.  Common suffixes include:

	.bin	MacBinary
	.sit	StuffIt
	.cpt	CompactPro
	.hqx	BinHex4.0
	.sea	self extracting archive

It is not uncommon for multiple transformations to be applied, so if
one had a file called foo.sit.bin, that likely means that it's a
MacBinary format of a StuffIt archive file.  So, to convert it, you
must turn the MacBinary file into a native Mac file, and then run
[un]StuffIt (or CompactPro, which can handle many StuffIt formats).

There's more information in the info-mac archives about getting files.
For example, here's info-mac/help/accessing-files.txt, as of 13Jun93:

> To access binaries in the Info-Mac archive at sumex-aim, use your
