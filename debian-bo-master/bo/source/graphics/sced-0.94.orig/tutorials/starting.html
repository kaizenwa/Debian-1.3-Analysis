<H2>Sced Tutorial 1</H2>
<H1>Getting Started</H1>
<H2>Sced Version 0.93</H2>
This tutorial introduces you to the very basic editing commands in Sced,
the methodology for editing objects, and the viewing commands.
<P>
The best way to do this is to run Sced while you're reading and
perform the operations as they are described.
<P>
<H2>Conventions</H2>
The string <I>Object/New</I> means the <I>New</I> entry off the
<I>Object</I> menu. I'll cheat and use the same syntax for dialog
boxes. So <I>Object/New/Cube</I> is the <I>Cube</I> field of the
<I>New</I> dialog box off the <I>Object</I> menu.

<H2>The Tutorial</H2>
<OL>
<LI>
We'll start by creating a cube. Select <I>Object/New/Cube</I>. A cube will
appear at the origin. Notice also that the <I>Edit</I> menu (the last button
on the left) is sensitive to input. Before creating the cube it was
grayed out, or desensitized.
<LI>
The sensitive <I>Edit</I> button indicates that there is something ready
to be edited. Not surprisingly, it's the cube that was just created. All
new objects in the scene window are placed on the edit menu at the time
of creation. Many people ask why there is an edit menu at all. The reason
is that there can be many objects on the queue to be edited at any one time,
but only one object can actually be edited at a time. So the menu allows you
to see which objects are available at any time (it visualizes the queue).
Anyway, select <I>Edit/Cube_0</I>. A large dialog window will pop up. Place
it somewhere where it is easy to reach but not in the way, because it will
stay up indefinitely (unless you explicitly close it). The cube should also
have changed.
<LI>
Take a look at the cube. There are several things to take notice of.
<UL>
<LI>
First is the large circle around the outside. That is the arcball circle,
which is helpful when using the rotation interface. It doesn't actually do
anything if clicked on.
<LI>
The cube itself has changed color, to indicate that it is the object being
edited.
<LI>
A small green circle has appeared at the center of the cube. This indicates
the <I>Origin Point</I> of the cube.
<LI>
A small red square has appeared at one corner of the cube. This indicates
the <I>Scaling Point</I> for the cube.
<LI>
You should notice a line on top of each of the X and Z axes. These are the
cube's <I>Major and Minor Axes</I>. The Major one is the longer one, under
the Z axis.
</UL>
All these features are used for editing the object.
<LI>
Take a look at the Edit dialog box. It contains several buttons in the top
left corner, and then a sequence of boxes, each of the same basic type. The
buttons control editing commands. There is one box for each feature. So
for the cube there is are Origin, Major Axis, Minor Axis and Scaling
boxes. Each box contains:
<UL>
<LI>
A button for changing the location of the feature relative to the object.
That's the button or menu with the name of the feature on it.
<LI>
A box containing a set of toggles. Each toggle is a <I>Constraint</I>
that may be placed on the feature. So Origin has 3 possible constraints
and Major Axis has 1.
<LI>
An Add menu, to add new constraints to the set of available constraints.
<LI>
A Modify button, to change the definition of a constraint, or delete it
from the set (a rather extreme form of modification).
</UL>
For this tutorial we will stick to the default constraints as provided.
Hence we will not use Add or Modify at all, nor will we change how a feature
relates to the object. The default constraints are actually the standard
constraints on 3d motion provided by most drawing packages. They constrain
the object to move along one of the orthogonal axis planes, or rotate
about the significant axes of a body (free rotation is also possible).
<LI>
Note that if anything goes wrong, Undo will either undo or cancel an operation,
whichever is meaningful. It can undo all the way back to the start of the
current edit session (when the object was chosen off the edit menu).
<LI>
So lets move the cube around. First you must select some constraint on the
Origin, so that Sced knows how to translate 2d mouse motion into 3d. Lets
try <I>X-Y Plane</I> This constrains the Origin Point to stay in the same
X-Y plane that it is currently in. In other words, it restricts motion to be
in the plane parallel to the X-Y plane. To select this constraint, click on
<I>X-Y Plane</I> under the <I>Origin</I>. It should toggle on. In the main
window should appear a square centered on the Origin. This indicates that
that the Origin is constrained to a plane, and shows which plane it is
constrained to.
<LI>
Notice the cursor change as you move the mouse around with the button up.
The 2 little arrows indicate that rotation will take place if you push the
button down at that point. The funny inverted cross thing says that translation
will take place if you button down there. A circle says that nothing can/will
happen if you button down there. There is also a double ended arrow that
indicates scaling, but it will not appear in the current configuration.
<LI>
To move the object, click <I>on the green Origin Point</I> and drag. The cube
will move around under the mouse, all the while staying in the constraint
plane. It's that simple.
<LI>
To move in a different plane, deselect the current constraint and choose another
from the same set.
<LI>
If 2 plane constraints are selected, say the <I>X-Y</I> and <I>Y-Z</I>, the
square in the screen turns into a line pointing in the Y axis direction. That
is because, if more than one constraint is selected, Sced takes the geometric
intersection of all the constraints, in this case the 2 planes. The intersection
of the 2 planes selected is a line in the Y direction. Dragging now will move
the object along that line. Selecting the <I>Z-X</I>
plane changes the line to a circle, indicating that the intersection of all
the constraints is a circle, and hence the object cannot move (note the circle
cursor when over the Origin).
<LI>
By now you probably have no idea where the cube is in space. The best way to
find out is to rotate the view and see how the cube moves. It's easier if
there are other objects in the scene.
<LI>
The easiest way to change the view is to hold down the shift key and drag
the mouse. The view will rotate about the origin of the world, or the
<I>Look At</I> point. The same effect can be achieved by selecting
<I>View/Viewpoint</I>, but now you don't have to hold down any keys, but you
do need to select the <I>Apply</I> button to explicitly cancel the view change.
This method also has the advantage of allowing you to enter a viewing direction
in the little window at the bottom of the Sced window.
<LI>
You can also Zoom in and out using the + and - keys. Or you can set a zoom
explicitly using <I>Window/Zoom</I>.
<LI>
Panning works like changing the viewpoint, but uses the Alt or Meta key
instead of shift. It also has an entry on the View menu.
<LI>
You can change which way is Up and which point is the center of the view
using <I>View/Look Up</I> and <I>View/Look At</I>. Each requires you to select
points from the scene to define the new up or at direction. To select a point
simply click inside the little red square that appears, or type in a vector
at the bottom and click on <I>Apply</I> or hit return. Look Up requires
2 points, which form the endpoints of the new up vector. In general you only
change Up once. For VRML it should be defined as the Y axis.
<LI>
Finally you can change the viewing distance (the distance from the
<I>Look At</I> point to the viewplane, or the eye distance (the distance from
the viewplane to the center of projection) using <I>View/Distance</I> and
<I>View/Eye</I> respectively.
<LI>
Back to the cube. It should still be in edit mode. To rotate the cube,
just button down and drag anywhere outside of the Origin and Scaling points
(where the cursor is 2 little arrows). You can constrain the rotation axis by
selecting either of the default constraints under Major or Minor Axis in the
Edit window. Large arcs appear to indicate the constraint axis.
<LI>
To scale the cube, constraints must be applied to the Scaling Point (similar
to the Origin Point). In fact it works the same way, but now instead of
the object moving when you drag in the red point, it is scaled. The defaults
are different to. The planes are now parallel to the various axes of the
object. Play with it to figure out which is which. The same rules for
constraint combination apply.
<LI>
To finish with the cube, click on <I>Finish</I> in the Edit window.
<LI>
Now lets make it into a scene that's actually useful. First, attributes for the
cube. Highlight the cube by dragging a rectangle that contains any edge or edges
of the cube. Use button 1, because it selects. Button 2 or 3 unselects.
<LI>
Choose <I>Object/Attributes</I>. A dialog appears with lots of attribute
choices. Change them as you wish. All values should be between 0 and 1.
Click on <I>Done</I> when ready.
<LI>
Now choose <I>Object/Name</I>, and enter a new name for the object. Notice that
it's still selected. So after setting the name, deselect it (drag over with
button 2 or 3).
<LI>
We need some lights. Select <I>Light/Ambient</I> and enter 0.2. That sets the
ambient light level. If only one value is entered it is taken as white light.
<LI>
Also choose <I>Lights/Point</I>. A light is created at the origin of the
scene. Select <I>Edit/Light_0</I> and the Edit dialog will pop to the front.
Notice now that the only feature is the Origin, because that is all that
defines a point light source. You can move the light around using the same
techniques as for the cube. Select Finish when done.
<LI>
Select the light (by dragging over it), and choose <I>Object/Attributes</I>.
The attributes will just be a single color set. Try 0.8 (it works just like
ambient).
<LI>
Deselect the light. We're almost done.
<LI>
Every scene needs a camera. Go to <I>Camera/Edit Values</I> and click on
<I>Viewport</I>. This matches the camera to the current view of the scene.
Then select <I>Done</I>.
<LI>
That should be it. Select <I>Target</I> and your desired target renderer.
<LI>
Select <I>File/Save</I> and enter a filename. Starting.scn is probably a good
one.
<LI>
Select <I>File/Export</I> to export the scene. Choose a name.
<LI>
To exit, use <I>File/Quit</I>.
</OL>
<P>
That's it. Somewhere you now have a file containing a description of a cube
and a light in the format of your choice. Render it using your normal rendering
method.
