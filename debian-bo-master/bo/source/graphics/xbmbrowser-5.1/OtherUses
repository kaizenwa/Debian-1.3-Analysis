The following are other uses for the xbmbroswer which has been
suggested by users.. Maybe you can do better..

Application Script Launcher

Idea : Jim Spath <jspath@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us>     20 July 1995

Create a directory with the appropriate icon images (bitmap or pixmap)
and storing ".rc" lauch scripts under the same basename name.

EG:    applcation.xpm  applcation.rc

Now in this directory create the following xbmbrowser menu configuration
file which I will call "Menu" in these examples but could be anything.

=======8<--------
#
# XbmBrowser Application Launcher
#
menu "main"     # lets keep xbmbrowser happy!
item "quit"  quit()

menu "global"
item "Execute"       exec("%b.rc" &)
item "Edit"          exec("vi %b.rc")
=======8<--------

Then just execute xbmbrowser in this directory

xbmbrowser -cf ./Menu

To make this work even better you can hide the control panels at the top
of the xbmbrowser by setting the following resources in your .Xdefaults or
load them into the server with xrdb. NOTE: You can NOT set the max size to 0.

   xb_launch.cmd_rc:        "./Menu"
   xb_launch.icons_only:    True
   xb_launch*buttons.max:   1
   xb_launch*directory.max: 1
   xb_launch*label.max:     1

If all the icons are on one row across the browser you can remove the
control panels entirely with the following resource. However you will have
to set the geometry size of the browser, or it will not look very good.

   xb_launch*main.refigureMode:  False

Then run xbmbrowser with

   ( cd {directory}; xbmbrowser -name xb_launch -geometry {whatever} & )

Note: xbmbrowser CDs into a directory given on the command line after
reading the configuration file, So we have to be in the right directory
first.
