    following code will make a pixmap object named "toy" gray:

             begin_animate();
             select_obj_by_name(toy);
             call_simple_shortcut(MakeGray);

-----------------------> tgif-3.0 <-----------------------
It's been 9 months since the last release.  Finally, I've got rotation
(and a bunch of other stuff) to work.  This release is a beta release
at best.  Please send bug reports to william@cs.columbia.edu as soon as
possible so I can release patches.  Although version 3.0 is backward-
compatible, the file format is not forward-compatible (you won't be able
to read files generated by this version with older versions of tgif).
