This CD is aimed not only at those who want to create their own images or do general 3D programming work, but also at those who want simply to experience some high-quality renderings done by some of the best POV-Ray artists, and to learn from their source code. The CDROM contains over 500 ray-traced images.<p>
It's a good resource for those learning POV-Ray as well as those who are already proficient, and contains a Microsoft Windows-based interactive tutorial. The disk comes with a fold-out poster and reference sheet. The CD is compatible with DOS/Windows and Macintosh formats.<p>
The CDROM is available for free retrieval and browsing on the World Wide Web at <b>http://www.povray.org/pov-cdrom</b>. For more details you may also visit <b>http://www.povray.org/povcd</b>.<hr>

Section 3<br>Quick Start</h3></center>
The next section describes how to quickly install POV-Ray and render sample scenes on your computer. It is assumed that you are using an IBM-PC compatible computer with MS-DOS. For other platforms you must refer to the specific documentation included in archive that contains POV-Ray.<hr>
<a name="ref 64 pri 0"><a name="ref 65 pri 0"><center><h3><a name="section 3.1">
Section 3.1<br>Installing POV-Ray</h3></center>
Specific installation instructions are included with the executable program for your computer. In general, there are two ways to install POV-Ray.<p>
[ Note that the generic word &quot;directory&quot; is used throughout. Your operating system may use another word (subdirectory, folder, etc.) ]<p>
1) The messy way: Create a directory called POVRAY and copy all POV-Ray files into it. Edit and run all files and programs from this directory. This method works, but is not recommended.<p>
Or the preferred way:<p>
2) Create a directory called POVRAY and several subdirectories called INCLUDE, DEMO, SCENES, UTIL. The self-extracting archives used in some versions of the program will create subdirectories for you. If you create your own, the file tree for this should look something like this:<p>
<p>
Copy the executable file and docs into the directory POVRAY. Copy the standard include files into the subdirectory INCLUDE. Copy the sample scene files into the subdirectory SCENES. And copy any POV-Ray related utility programs and their related files into the subdirectory UTIL. Your own scene files will go into the SCENES subdirectory. Also, you'll need to add the directories \POVRAY and \POVRAY\UTIL to your &quot;search path&quot; so the executable programs can be run from any directory.<p>
<strong>Note that some operating systems don't have an equivalent to the multi-path search command.</strong><p>
The second method is a bit more difficult to set-up, but is preferred. There are many files associated with POV-Ray and they are far easier to deal with when separated into several directories.<hr>
<a name="ref 66 pri 0"><a name="ref 67 pri 0"><center><h3><a name="section 3.2">
Section 3.2<br>Basic Usage</h3></center>
<b>Notice:</b> If you did not install the program using the <b>install.exe</b> system, the examples and instructions given here may not work! The installation process configures <b>povray.ini</b> and several important batch files. Without these files configured, the examples herein may not work.<p>
POV-Ray's basic purpose is to read a scene description written in the POV language and to write an image file. The scene files are plain ASCII text files that you create using a text editor. Dozens of sample files are included with this package to illustrate the various features.<p>
You invoke POV-Ray by typing a command at the MS-DOS prompt. The command is <b>povray</b> and it must be followed by one or more command line switches. Each switch begins with a plus or minus sign. Blanks separate the switches. The switches may be upper or lower case.<p>
Note: The examples in this documentation assume you installed POV-Ray in the <b>c:\povray3</b> directory. The installer will let you install POV-Ray anywhere and will properly configure it for the drive and directory you specified. You just substitute that drive and directory anywhere we tell you to use <b>c:\povray3</b>. Change to that directory now. Then type the following command line and press [ENTER]<p>
<pre>
  POVRAY +ISHAPES +D1
</pre>
<p>
The <a name="ref 68 pri 0"><strong>+I</strong> command (for <strong>input</strong>) tells the program what file to read as input. If you don't give an extension on the file name, <b>.pov</b> is assumed. Thus <a name="ref 68 pri 1"><strong>+I</strong><b>shapes</b> tells it to read in <b>shapes.pov</b> to be rendered.<p>
The <a name="ref 69 pri 1"><strong>+D</strong> switch (for <strong>display</strong>) tells the program to turn the graphic preview display on. A <a name="ref 70 pri 1"><strong>-D</strong> would turn it off. The number &quot;1&quot; tells it what type of display to use. Type &quot;1&quot; is the old fashioned standard generic VGA at 320 by 200 resolution and just 256 colors. This is pretty much guaranteed to work on any VGA video system.<p>
There are other options in effect besides those you typed on the command line. They are stored in a file called <b>povray.ini</b> which was created by the install system. POV-Ray automatically looks for this file in the same directory where <b>povray.exe</b> resides. See <a href="pov30002.htm#ref 71 pri 0">&quot;INI Files&quot;</a> and <a href="pov30014.htm#ref 72 pri 0">&quot;Using INI Files&quot;</a> for more information on <b>povray.ini</b> and other INI files.<p>
When you enter the command shown above, you will see brightly colored geometric shapes begin to appear as POV-Ray calculates the color of each pixel row by row. You will probably be disappointed with the graphic display results. That is because this is only a preview display. The actual image is in full 24-bit color but we cannot display that high quality using simple VGA with a fixed set of 256 colors. If your hardware supports the VESA interface standard or you have a VESA TSR driver loaded, try running with <a name="ref 73 pri 1"><strong>+DG</strong> rather than <a name="ref 74 pri 1"><strong>+D1</strong>. This will give you access to all of the various modes your video hardware can use. If you have 15-bit or 16- bit high color capability try <a name="ref 75 pri 1"><strong>+DGH</strong> or if you have 24-bit true color capability try <a name="ref 76 pri 1"><strong>+DGT</strong> to see the image in all its glory. See section <a href="pov30003.htm#ref 77 pri 0">&quot;Display Types&quot;</a> below for more information on graphics preview.<p>
When the program finishes, you will hear beeps. After admiring the image, press [ENTER]. You will see a text screen of statistics. If the text is too much to fit on the screen you may press [CURSOR UP] or [CURSOR DOWN] keys to read more text. Notice that there are tabs at the bottom of the screen. Press [CURSOR LEFT] or [CURSOR RIGHT] keys to view other interesting text information. Press [ENTER] again to exit POV-Ray.<p>
If you do not have high color or true color ability you will have to view the image file to see the real colors. The image file <b>shapes.tga</b> is written to your current directory. By default POV-Ray creates files in TGA format. This is a standard format for storing 24-bit true-color images. You will need an image viewing program to view the file. Such programs are usually available from the same place where you obtained POV-Ray but a viewer is not included in this package.<p>
If you cannot view TGA files you may add the switch <a name="ref 78 pri 1"><strong>+FN</strong> and POV-Ray will output PNG (Portable Network Graphic) format. If PNG format viewer is not available then type the following<p>
<pre>
  T2G SHAPES
</pre>
<p>
and press [ENTER]. This will run a batch file that invokes the <b>tga2gif</b> program. The program will read your <b>shapes.tga</b> file, create an optimal 256 color palette and write a GIF format file <b>shapes.gif</b>. Most image viewing programs support GIF.<hr>
<a name="ref 79 pri 0"><a name="ref 80 pri 0"><center><h3><a name="section 3.2.1">
Section 3.2.1<br>Running Files in Other Directories</h3></center>
Normally POV-Ray only looks in the current directory for the files it needs. It does not search your MS-DOS path for data files; it only searches for programs. In the sample scene you just ran, file <b>shapes.pov</b> was in the current directory so this was no problem. That scene also needed other files but your <b>povray.ini</b> file tells POV-Ray other places to search for necessary files.<p>
If you allowed the install system to update your <b>autoexec.bat</b> file, then you can change to any drive or directory and can run POV-Ray from that directory. You will also be able to use the batch files and utilities that came with this package in any directory. For future reference let's call the &quot;use-<b>c:\povray3</b>-in-your-path-plan&quot; as <strong>plan one</strong>.<p>
There are some circumstances where you may not want to put <b>c:\povray3</b> in your path. There is a limit of 128 characters in your path statement and you may not have room for it. Try rendering the <b>shapes</b> example from a different directory. If it doesn't work, then you forgot to re-boot your system so the new path takes effect. If after re-booting it still doesn't work, it probably means your path is too full. You will have to adopt a different plan.<p>
Chances are, you already have several directories in your path. Most systems have <b>c:\DOS</b>, <b>c:\windows</b> or some directory such as <b>c:\utility</b> already in the path. We have provided several small batch files that you can copy to that directory. For future reference we'll call the &quot;put-batch-files-in-a-directory-already-on-the-path-plan&quot; as <strong>plan  two</strong>.<p>
At any DOS prompt, type the word <strong>path</strong> and press [ENTER]. It will show you what directories are already on your path. Then copy the following files from your <b>c:\povray3</b> directory to any of the directories already on your path. The files are:<p>
<pre>
  RUNPOV.BAT RERUNPOV.BAT RUNPHELP.BAT T2G.BAT
</pre>
<p>
Once you have copied these files, try the following example. In this case, do not invoke the program with the command <b>povray</b>. Instead use <b>runpov</b> as follows:<p>
<pre>
  cd \POVRAY3\POV3DEMO\SHOWOFF
  RUNPOV +ISUNSET3 +D1
</pre>
<p>
This changes to the <b>\povray3\pov3demo\showoff</b> directory where the file <b>sunset3.pov</b> is found. It runs the file <b>runpov.bat</b>. That batch file is set up to run POV-Ray even if it is not on the DOS path. It also passes the switches along to POV-Ray. These batch files have other uses, even if you are using <strong>plan one</strong> as described above or <strong>plan three</strong> as described below. For more on these batch files, see <a href="pov30002.htm#ref 81 pri 0">&quot;Batch Files&quot;</a>.<p>
All of the early examples in this document assumed you were running POV-Ray from the directory where it was installed such as <b>c:\povray3</b>. This approach of always using the installation directory is in fact <strong>plan three</strong>. If you are using this method, you need to tell POV-Ray where else to look for files. In the case of <b>sunset3.pov</b> you could do this:<p>
<pre>
  POVRAY +IC:\POVRAY3\POV3DEMO\SHOWOFF\SUNSET3 +D1
</pre>
<p>
However some scenes need more than one file. For example the directory <b>drums2</b> that can be found under <b>\povray3\povscn\level3</b> contains three files: <b>drums.pov</b>, <b>drums.inc</b> and <b>rednewt.gif</b> all of which are required for that one scene. In this case you should use the <a name="ref 82 pri 0"><strong>+L</strong> switch (for <strong>library</strong>) to add new library paths to those that POV-Ray will search. You would render the scene with this command.<p>
<pre>
  POVRAY +L\POVRAY3\POVSCN\LEVEL3\DRUMS2 +IDRUMS +D1
</pre>

Section 3.2.2<br>INI Files</h3></center>
There were more options used in these renderings than just the switches <a name="ref 68 pri 2"><strong>+I</strong>, <a name="ref 69 pri 3"><strong>+D</strong>, and <a name="ref 82 pri 4"><strong>+L</strong> that you specify. When you run the program, POV- Ray automatically looks for the file <b>povray.ini</b> in whatever directory that <b>povray.exe</b> is in. The <b>povray.ini</b> file contains many options that control how POV-Ray works. We have set this file up so that it is especially easy to run your first scene with minimal problems. The file should be placed in the same directory as <b>povray.exe</b> and it will automatically read when POV-Ray is run. If you ever move <b>povray.exe</b> to a different directory, be sure to move <b>povray.ini</b> too.<p>
Complete details on all of the available switches and options that can be given on the command line or in <b>povray.ini</b> are given in <a href="pov30014.htm#ref 6 pri 0">&quot;POV-Ray Options&quot;</a>.<p>
You may also create INI files of your own with switches or options similar to <b>povray.ini</b>. If you put a file name on the command line without a plus or minus sign before it, POV-Ray reads it as an INI file. Try this...<p>
<pre>
  POVRAY RES120 +ISHAPES +D1
</pre>
<p>
This causes POV-Ray to look for a file called <b>res120.ini</b> which we have provided. It sets your resolution to 120 by 90 pixels for a quick preview. The following INI files have been provided for you.<p>
<center><table border><tr><td valign=top>RES120.INI</td><td valign=top>Sets resolution to 120 by 90.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>RES320.INI</td><td valign=top>Sets resolution to 320 by 200.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>RES640.INI</td><td valign=top>Sets resolution to 640 by 480.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>RES800.INI</td><td valign=top>Sets resolution to 800 by 600.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>RES1K.INI</td><td valign=top>Sets resolution to 1024 by 768.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>LOW.INI</td><td valign=top>Sets low quality at 120 by 90.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>SLOW.INI</td><td valign=top>Turns on radiosity and anti-aliasing; very slow but beautiful.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>TGAFLI.INI TGAFLC.INI</td><td valign=top>Create an FLI/FLC animation from TGA images.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>PNGFLI.INI PNGFLC.INI</td><td valign=top>Create an FLI/FLC animation from DTA images.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ZIPFLI.INI ZIPFLC.INI</td><td valign=top>Create an FLI/FLC animation from zipped images. See &quot;ANIMATION TIPS&quot; below.</td></tr>

</td></tr></table></center>

<p>
You can create your own custom INI's which can contain any command in the reference guide.<hr>

Section 3.2.3<br>Alternatives to POVRAY.INI</h3></center>
The <b>povray.ini</b> file is supposed to hold your favorite global default options that you want to use all the time. You should feel free to edit it with new options that suit your needs. However it must be located in the same directory as <b>povray.exe</b> or it won't be found. The DOS path isn't searched nor will <a name="ref 82 pri 2"><strong>+L</strong> commands help because <b>povray.ini</b> is processed before any command line switches.<p>
If your <b>povray.exe</b> resides on a CD-ROM then you can't edit the <b>povray.ini</b> on the CD. There is an alternative. You may use an environment variable to specify an alternative global default.<p>
In your <b>autoexec.bat</b> file add a line similar to this:<p>
<pre>
  set POVINI=D:\DIRECT\FILE.INI
</pre>
<p>
which sets the POVINI environment variable to whatever drive, directory and INI file you choose. If you specify any POVINI environment variable then <b>povray.ini</b> is <b>not read</b>. This is true even if the file you named doesn't exist. Note that you are specifying an entire path and file name. This is not a pointer to a directory containing <b>povray.ini</b>. It is a pointer to the actual file itself.<p>
Note that the POVRAYOPT environment variable in previous versions of POV-Ray is no longer supported.<hr>
<a name="ref 86 pri 0"><a name="ref 81 pri 0"><center><h3><a name="section 3.2.4">
Section 3.2.4<br>Batch Files</h3></center>
We've already described how the file <b>runpov.bat</b> can be used as an alternative to running POV-Ray directly. <b>runpov.bat</b> also has one other use. It uses the <a name="ref 87 pri 0"><strong>+GI</strong> switch to create a file called <b>rerun.ini</b>. This makes it very easy to run the same file over again with the same parameters. When creating your own scene files you will probably make dozens of test renders. This is a very valuable feature. Here is how it works... Suppose you render a scene as follows:<p>
<pre>
  RUNPOV +IMYSCENE +D1 RES120
</pre>
<p>
This renders <b>myscene.pov</b> at 120 by 90 resolution. Note there is no such scene. This is hypothetical. After viewing it, you noticed a mistake which you fixed with your text editor. To rerun the scene type:<p>
<pre>
  RERUNPOV
</pre>
<p>
and that's all. It will rerun the same scene you just ran. Suppose you want more detail on the next run. You can add more switches or INI files. For example:<p>
<pre>
  RERUNPOV RES320
</pre>
<p>
will rerun at higher resolution. Subsequent uses of <b>rerunpov</b> will be at 320 by 200 until you tell it differently. As another example, the <a name="ref 88 pri 0"><strong>+A</strong> switch turns on anti-aliasing. Typing &quot;<b>rerunpov</b> <a name="ref 88 pri 1"><strong>+A</strong>&quot; reruns with anti- aliasing on. All subsequent reruns will have it on until you do a &quot;<b>rerunpov</b> <a name="ref 89 pri 1"><strong>-A</strong>&quot; to turn it off. Note if you do another <b>runpov</b> it starts over from your <b>povray.ini</b> defaults and it overwrites the old <b>rerun.ini</b>.<p>
Two other batch files are included. <b>runphelp.bat</b> is only used as an alternative way to run <b>povhelp</b> from another directory. If you used installation <strong>plan two</strong> then use <b>runphelp.bat</b> rather than <b>povhelp.exe</b>. This batch file serves no other purpose.<p>
Finally <b>t2g.bat</b> invokes the <b>tga2gif.exe</b> program for converting TGA files to GIF files. You could run \FILE {tga2gif} directly but its default parameters do not generally produce the best results. If you use T2G instead, it adds some command line switches which work better. For a full list of switches available for <b>tga2gif</b>, type <b>tga2gif</b> with no parameters and it will display the available switches and options.<hr>
