Appendix A.7<br>Conditions for Distribution of Custom Versions</h3></center>
The user is granted the privilege to modify and compile the source code for their own personal use in any fashion they see fit. What you do with the software in your own home is your business.<p>
If the user wishes to distribute a modified version of the software, documentation or other parts of the package (here after referred to as a <strong>custom version</strong>) they must follow the provisions given below. This includes any translation of the documentation into other languages or other file formats. These license provisions have been established to promote the growth of POV-Ray and prevent difficulties for users and developers alike. Please follow them carefully for the benefit of all concerned when creating a custom version.<p>
No portion of the POV-Ray source code may be incorporated into another program unless it is clearly a custom version of POV-Ray that includes all of the basic functions of POV-Ray.<p>
All executables, documentation, modified files and descriptions of the same must clearly identify themselves as a modified and unofficial version of POV-Ray. Any attempt to obscure the fact that the user is running POV-Ray or to obscure that this is an unofficial version expressly prohibited.<p>
You must provide all POV-Ray support for all users who use your custom version. You must provide information so that user may contact you for support for your custom version. The POV-Ray Team is not obligated to provide you or your users any technical support.<p>
Include contact information in the DISTRIBUTION_MESSAGE macros in the source file <b>optout.h</b> and insure that the program prominently displays this information. Display all copyright notices and credit screens for the official version.<p>
Custom versions may only be distributed as freeware. You must make all of your modifications to POV-Ray freely and publicly available with <b>full source code</b> to the modified portions of POV-Ray and must freely distribute full source to any new parts of the custom version. The goal is that users must be able to re-compile the program themselves and to be able to further improve the program with their own modifications.<p>
You must provide documentation for any and all modifications that you have made to the program that you are distributing. Include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the official POV-Ray.<p>
The user is encouraged to send enhancements and bug fixes to the POV-Ray Team, but the team is in no way required to utilize these enhancements or fixes. By sending material to the team, the contributor asserts that he owns the materials or has the right to distribute these materials. He authorizes the team to use the materials any way they like. The contributor still retains rights to the donated material, but by donating, grants unrestricted, irrevocable usage and distribution rights to the POV-Ray Team. The team doesn't have to use the material, but if we do, you do not acquire any rights related to POV-Ray. The team will give you credit as the creator of new code if applicable.<p>
Include a copy of the <b>povlegal.doc</b> document.<hr>

Appendix A.8<br>Conditions for Commercial Bundling</h3></center>
Vendors wishing to bundle POV-Ray with commercial software (including shareware) or with publications must first obtain explicit permission from the POV-Ray Team. This includes any commercial software or publications, such as, but not limited to, magazines, cover-disk distribution, books, newspapers, or newsletters in print or machine readable form.<p>
The POV-Ray Team will decide if such distribution will be allowed on a case-by-case basis and may impose certain restrictions as it sees fit. The minimum terms are given below. Other conditions may be imposed.<p>
<center><table border><tr><td valign=top>*</td><td valign=top>Purchasers of your product must not be led to believe that they are paying for POV-Ray. Any mention of the POV-Ray bundle on the box, in advertising or in instruction manuals must be clearly marked with a disclaimer that POV-Ray is free software and can be obtained for free or nominal cost from various sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>*</td><td valign=top>Include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the official POV-Ray.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>*</td><td valign=top>You must provide all POV-Ray support for all users who acquired POV-Ray through your product. The POV-Ray Development Team is not obligated to provide you or your customers any technical support.</td></tr>

Appendix A.9<br>Retail Value of This Software</h3></center>
Although POV-Ray is, when distributed within the terms of this agreement, free of charge, the retail value (or price) of this program is determined as US $20.00 per copy distributed or copied. If the software is distributed or copied without authorization you are legally liable to this debt to the copyright holder or any other person or organization delegated by the copyright holder for the collection of this debt, and you agree that you are legally bound by the above and will pay this debt within 30 days of the event.<p>
However, none of the above paragraph constitutes permission for you to distribute this software outside of the terms of this agreement. In particular, the conditions and debt mentioned above (whether paid or unpaid) do not allow you to avoid statutory damages or other legal penalties and does not constitute any agreement that would allow you to avoid such other legal remedies as are available to the copyright holder.<p>
Put simply, POV-Ray is only free if you comply with our distribution conditions; it is not free otherwise. The copyright holder of this software chooses to give it away free under these and only these conditions.<p>
For the purpose of copyright regulations, the retail value of this software is US $20.00 per copy.<hr>

Appendix A.10<br>Other Provisions</h3></center>
The team permits and encourages the creation of programs, including commercial packages, which import, export or translate files in the POV-Ray Scene Description Language. There are no restrictions on use of the language itself. We reserve the right to add or remove or change any part of the language.<p>
&quot;POV-Ray&quot;, &quot;Persistence of Vision&quot;, &quot;POV-Ray Team&quot; and &quot;POV-Help&quot; are trademarks of the POV-Ray Team.<p>
While we do not claim any restrictions on the letters &quot;POV&quot; alone, we humbly request that you not use POV in the name of your product. Such use tends to imply it is a product of the POV-Ray Team. Existing programs which used &quot;POV&quot; prior to the publication of this document need not feel guilty for doing so provided that you make it clear that the program is not the work of the team nor endorsed by us.<hr>

Appendix A.11<br>Revocation of License</h3></center>
<b>VIOLATION OF THIS LICENSE IS A VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHT LAWS. IT  WILL RESULT IN REVOCATION OF ALL DISTRIBUTION PRIVILEGES AND MAY  RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTY</b>.<p>
Such violators who are prohibited from distribution will be identified in this document.<p>
In this regard, &quot;PC Format&quot;, a magazine published by Future Publishing, Ltd. in the United Kingdom, distributed incomplete versions of POV-Ray 1.0 in violation the license which was effect at the time. They later attempted to distribute POV-Ray 2.2 without prior permission of the POV-Ray Team in violation the license which was in effect at the time. There is evidence that other Future Publishing companies have also violated our terms. Therefore &quot;PC Format&quot;, and any other magazine, book or CD-ROM publication owned by Future Publishing is expressly prohibited from any distribution of POV-Ray software until further notice.<hr>

Appendix F.1<br>Scene Design Tips</h3></center>
There are a number of excellent shareware CAD style modelers available on the DOS platform now that will create POV-Ray scene files. The online systems mentioned elsewhere in this document are the best places to find these.<p>
Hundreds of special-purpose utilities have been written for POV-Ray: data conversion programs, object generators, shell-style <strong>launchers</strong> and more. It would not be possible to list them all here, but again, the online systems listed will carry most of them. Most, following the POV-Ray spirit, are freeware or inexpensive shareware.<p>
Some extremely elaborate scenes have been designed by drafting on graph paper. Raytracer Mike Miller recommends graph paper with a grid divided in tenths, allowing natural decimal conversions.<p>
Start out with a <strong>boilerplate</strong> scene file, such as a copy of <b>basicvue.pov</b>, and edit that. In general, place your objects near and around the <strong>origin</strong> with the camera in the negative z-direction, looking at the origin. Naturally, you will break from this rule many times, but when starting out, keep things simple.<p>
For basic, boring, but dependable lighting, place a light source at or near the position of the camera. Objects will look flat, but at least you will see them. From there, you can move it slowly into a better position.<hr>
