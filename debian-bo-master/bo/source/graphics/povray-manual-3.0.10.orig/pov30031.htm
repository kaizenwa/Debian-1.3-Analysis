Appendix F.2<br>Scene Debugging Tips</h3></center>
To see a quick version of your picture, render it very small. With fewer pixels to calculate the ray-tracer can finish more quickly. <a name="ref 594 pri 1"><strong>-W</strong>160 <a name="ref 1587 pri 1"><strong>-H</strong>100 is a good size.<p>
Use the <a name="ref 785 pri 7"><strong>+Q</strong> <strong>quality</strong> switch when appropriate.<p>
If there is a particular area of your picture that you need to see in high resolution, perhaps with anti-aliasing on (perhaps a fine-grained wood texture), use the <a name="ref 646 pri 9"><strong>+SC</strong>, <a name="ref 647 pri 10"><strong>+EC</strong>, <a name="ref 644 pri 13"><strong>+SR</strong> and <a name="ref 645 pri 15"><strong>+ER</strong> switches to isolate a <strong>window</strong>.<p>
If your image contains a lot of inter-reflections, set <a name="ref 913 pri 26"><strong>max_trace_level</strong> to a low value such as 1 or 2. Don't forget to put it back up when you're finished!<p>
<strong>Turn off</strong> any unnecessary lights. Comment out extended light keywords when not needed for debugging. Again, don't forget to put them back in before you retire for the night with a final render running!<p>
If you've run into an error that is eluding you by visual examination it's time to start bracketing your file. Use the block comment characters <a name="ref 1043 pri 28"><strong>/* ... */</strong> to disable most of your scene and try to render again. If you no longer get an error the problem naturally lies somewhere within the disabled area. Slow and methodical testing like this will eventually get you to a point where you will either be able to spot the bug, or go quietly insane. Maybe both.<p>
If you seem to have <strong>lost</strong> yourself or an object (a common experience for beginners) there are a few tricks that can sometimes help:<p>
<center><table border><tr><td valign=top>1)</td><td valign=top>Move your camera way back to provide a long range view. This may not help with very small objects which tend to be less visible at a distance, but it's a nice trick to keep up your sleeve.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>2)</td><td valign=top>Try setting the ambient value to 1.0 if you suspect that the object may simply be hidden from the lights. This will make it self-illuminated and you'll be able to see it even with no lights in the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>3)</td><td valign=top>Replace the object with a larger, more obvious &quot;stand-in&quot; object like a large sphere or box. Be sure that all the same transformations are applied to this new shape so that it ends up in the same spot.</td></tr>

Appendix F.3<br>Animation Tips</h3></center>
When animating objects with solid textures, the textures must move with the object, i. e. apply the same rotate or translate functions to the texture as to the object itself. This is now done automatically if the transformations are placed <b>after</b> the texture block like the following example<p>
<listing>
  shape { ...
    pigment { ... }
    scale &lt; ... &gt;
  }
</listing>
<p>
will scale the shape and pigment texture by the same amount.<p>
<listing>
  shape { ...
    scale &lt; ... &gt;
    pigment { ... }
  }
</listing>
<p>
will scale the shape but not the pigment.<p>
Constants can be declared for most of the data types in the program including floats and vectors. By writing these to include files you can easily separate the parameters for an animation into a separate file.<p>
Some examples of declared constants would be:<p>
<listing>
   #declare Y_Rotation = 5.0 * clock
   #declare ObjectRotation = &lt;0, Y_Rotation, 0&gt;
   #declare MySphere = sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1.1234 }
</listing>
<p>
Other examples can be found scattered throughout the sample scene files.<p>
A tip for MS-Dos users: Get ahold of <b>dta.exe</b> (Dave's Targa Animator) for creating .FLI/.FLC animations. <b>aaplay.exe</b> and <b>play.exe</b> are common viewers for this type of file.<p>
When moving the camera in an animation (or placing one in a still image, for that matter) avoid placing the camera directly over the origin. This will cause very strange errors. Instead, move off center slightly and avoid hovering directly over the scene.<hr>

Wood is designed like a <strong>log</strong> with growth rings aligned along the z-axis. Generally these will look best when scaled down by about a tenth (to a unit-sized object). Start out with rather small value for the turbulence too (around 0.05 is good for starters).<p>
The marble texture is designed around a pigment primitive that is much like an x-gradient. When turbulated, the effect is different when viewed from the <strong>side</strong> or from the <strong>end</strong>. Try rotating it by 90 degrees on the y-axis to see the difference.<p>
You cannot get specular highlights on a totally black object. Try using a very dark gray, say <strong>Gray10</strong> or <strong>Gray15</strong> (from <b>colors.in</b>), instead.<hr>

Appendix F.5<br>Height Field Tips</h3></center>
Try using POV-Ray itself to create images for height fields: <listing>
  camera { location &lt;0, 0, -2&gt; }
  plane { z, 0
     finish { ambient 1 }    // needs no light sources
     pigment { bozo }        // or whatever.  Experiment.
  }
</listing>
<p>
That's all you'll need to create a <b>.tga</b> file that can then be used as a height field in another image!<hr>

Appendix F.6<br>Converting "Handedness"</h3></center>
If you are importing images from other systems you may find that the shapes are backwards (left-to-right inverted) and no rotation can make them correct.<p>
<a name="ref 99 pri 6">Often, all you have to do is negate the terms in the right vector of the camera to flip the camera left-to-right (use the <strong>right-hand</strong> coordinate system). Some programs seem to interpret the coordinate systems differently, however, so you may need to experiment with other camera transformations if you want the y- and z-vectors to work as POV-Ray does.<hr>

Appendix G.2<br>POV-Ray Options Questions</h3></center>
<b>Q:</b> How can I set mosaic preview to go from 8*straight to final render without going to 4*and then 2*first? <b>A:</b> Use the <a name="ref 685 pri 1"><strong>+SP</strong>n or <a name="ref 684 pri 4"><strong>Preview_Start_Size</strong> option to set the starting resolution and the <a name="ref 687 pri 5"><strong>+EP</strong>n or <a name="ref 686 pri 8"><strong>Preview_End_Size</strong> option to set the ending resolution. With <a name="ref 685 pri 10"><strong>+SP</strong>8 and <a name="ref 687 pri 12"><strong>+EP</strong>8 it will go from 8*8 down to 8*8 (just one pass) then immediately drop into the final pass at 1*1.<p>
<b>Q:</b> Should the <a name="ref 793 pri 15"><strong>+MB</strong> switch be used in very small scenes, i. e. with a low number of objects. <b>A:</b> That depends on the number of objects and their type. Normally it doesn't hurt to always use the bounding box hierarchy (<a name="ref 793 pri 19"><strong>+MB</strong>0). If you have just one or two objects it may be better to not use automatic bounding.<p>
<b>Q:</b> Does the <a name="ref 793 pri 24"><strong>+MB</strong> switch affect the quality of the image? <b>A:</b> No. It only affects the speed of the intersection tests.<p>
<b>Q:</b> How do I avoid that the options screen scrolls off when error messages are generated? <b>A:</b> Use the <a name="ref 592 pri 26"><strong>+P</strong> switch. Everytime POV-Ray is interrupted or the tracing finishes you can use the cursor keys to scroll-back the options text.<hr>

<b>Q:</b> In the file <b>textures.v2</b>, the glass textures are commented out. Why? <b>A:</b> The old glass textures are duplicated in <b>glass.inc</b>. The old texture names didn't fit in with the new naming scheme. Glass is now T_Glass1, Glass2 is now T_Glass2 and Glass3 is now T_Glass3. While you can easily un-comment the old names you're strongly encouraged to use the newer naming scheme.<hr>

Appendix G.4.1<br>Height Field Questions</h3></center>
<b>Q:</b> I have a lowly 8 meg of RAM on my computer and I ran out of memory trying to use a 1024x768 <b>pot</b> file and a <b>gif</b> of the same resolution as height fields (two different scenes). Is it my memory thats low or is that resolution crazy? <b>A:</b> Smoothed heightfields will consume a lot more memory (about three times as much) as one that isn't smoothed. Since smoothing really isn't neccessary at those resolutions don't smooth (if you're smoothing).<p>
<b>Q:</b> I want to use the same image for an image map and a height-field (which gives some meaningful relationship between the height and colors). Does that only work when using a <b>gif</b> or <b>bmp</b> format? I couldn't get the <b>pot</b> file to map (format not supported). <b>A:</b> <b>pot</b> files are not supported as image maps. Their purpose to POV-Ray is as heightfields. That doesn't prevent you from making a matching <b>gif</b> in <b>fractint</b> that uses the continuous potential coloring that you used for the 16 bit <b>pot</b> file, and using that as the image map. Remember that both image maps and height fields are initialized in a 1*1(*1) area, with the lower-left of the image situated at the origin. The image map is initiated in the x-y-plane while the height field is in the x-z plane. Thus you'll have to rotate the image map by 90 degrees around the x-axis (use <strong>rotate x*90</strong>) to get the image map to line up.<hr>

Appendix G.5.1<br>Atmosphere Questions</h3></center>
<b>Q:</b> Why is the atmosphere I added not visible? <b>A:</b> The most common error made when adding an atmosphere to a scene is the missing hollow keyword in all objects the camera currently is in. If you are inside a box that is used to model a room you'll have to add the hollow keyword to the box statement. If a plane is used to model the ground you'll have to make it hollow (only if you are inside the plane, but to be sure you can always do it).<p>
If this doesn't help there may be other problems you'll have to verify. The distance and scattering values of the atmosphere have to be larger than zero. Light sources that shall interact with the atmosphere mustn't contain an <strong>atmosphere off</strong> statement.<p>
<b>Q:</b> Why can't I see any atmosphere through my translucent object? <b>A:</b> If you have a translucent object you (almost) always have to make it hollow by adding the <a name="ref 384 pri 9"><strong>hollow</strong> keyword. Whenever an intersection is found and the ray is inside a solid object no atmospheric effects will be calculated.<p>
If you have a partially transparent plane for example the atmosphere on the other side of the plane will only be visible through the plane if this plane is hollow.<p>
<b>Q:</b> Why do the lit parts of the atmosphere amplify the background? <b>A:</b> First, they don't.<p>
Second, whenever parts of the background are visible through the atmosphere and those areas of the atmosphere are lit by any light source, the scattered light is added to the light coming from the background. This is the reason why the background seems to be amplified by the atmosphere. Just imagine the followoing example: you have a blue background that is attenuated be the atmosphere in a way that the color reaching the viewer is &lt;0,0,0.2&gt;. Now some light coming from a light source is attenuated and scattered by the atmosphere and finally reaches the viewer with a color of &lt;0.5,0.5,0.5&gt;. Since we already have light coming from the background, both colors are added to give &lt;0.5,0.5,0.7&gt;. Thus the light gets a blue hue. As a result you think that the background light is amplified but it isn't as the following scene clearly shows.<p>

<center><img src="pov3005f.gif" border=0 width=320 height=240><br><cite>The atmosphere seems to amplify what is seen in the background.</cite></center><br> <p>
In the background you see a red/green checkered plane. The background color visible through the atmosphere is added to the light scattered from the spotlights. You'll notice that even though the red squares behind the red spotlight's cone are brighter than those outside the cone the green ones are not. For the green spotlight the situation is turned around: the green squares seem to be amplified while the red are not. The blue spotlight doesn't show this effect at all.<p>
<b>Q:</b> The docs say the distance parameter for atmosphere works in the same way as fog distance. Is that right? <b>A:</b> Yes, that's right. Try to use a fog instead of the atmosphere. If everything looks good, i. e. you still can see the background or whatever you want to see, use the same distance and color for the atmosphere.<hr>

<strong>Using the Help Reader (POVHELP.EXE)</strong><p>
<b>KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES </b><p>
See after the Quick Intro.<p>
<strong>Quick Intro</strong><p>
Use the <strong>+E</strong> option to make the help reader a pop-up program. Use <strong>Space</strong> to go to the next section. Use <strong>Ctrl-PgUp</strong> and <strong>Ctrl-PgDn</strong> to move between sections also. Use <strong>Tab</strong> to highlight hypertext links. Use <strong>Alt-Tab</strong> to highlight code fragments. Use <strong>Enter</strong> to jump to a highlighted hypertext link. Use <strong>+/-</strong> to jump to relevant sections once link jumping has started. Use <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> to return to the last place you were before a search/jump. Use <strong>'S'</strong> to search on a keyword. Use <strong>'J'</strong> to toggle text justification when reading a section. Use <strong>'P'</strong> to paste code into your application via the keyboard buffer.<p>
POV-Help will handle non-standard page widths provided the BIOS column count is correctly updated by whatever program is being used to alter it from 80 columns.<p>
If you use POV-Help as a pop-up program, it will attempt to search on the word under your cursor when you pop it up. Note that if you exit pop-up mode by using the hot-key (the default is ALT-ESC), POV-Help takes this to mean that you want to return to the same place next time and will not perform a search. A search is only performed if you exited using ESCAPE (meaning you have finished with the current subject.)<p>
The history stack activated by using Backspace holds 32 entries.<p>

<strong>General</strong><p>
The help reader wraps most text. Excluded are specified portions, lists, and a few others. Use the left and right arrow keys to scroll these if need be.<p>
The help reader is intended to be a 'shell' around an editor program. Some people may prefer the term 'shim'.<p>
Using EMS for most memory requirements, it loads itself and then runs your editor for you, providing pop-up help facilities. It will also be able to paste code fragments into your source. If your editor was, for example, 'ME', you would place a batch file called 'ME.BAT' in your scene development directory. If you use 'VI', you'd create 'VI.BAT', and so on.<p>

This would load the help reader. which would then load ME.EXE, and things would proceed as normal. When you exit your editor, the help reader automatically unloads. You can use the ALT-ESC key sequence to pop up POVHELP. This is the default ; there is a way to set it. Note that no other parameters may appear after the +E parameter as they will just be passed to the program being run.<p>
If you use the hotkey to pop-up, POVHELP performs a simplistic search of sections and titles based on the word under the cursor. If found, you are taken to that. Otherwise, you are taken to the main menu, unless you hot-keyed out.<p>
You can hot-key out of the actual section text, by using the same hot key that got you in. If you press escape, you are taken back up to the top menu. But if you hotkey out, you go back to your program. Next time you press the hot key, you will be taken back to the same place. No search is performed in this case.<p>
<strong>POVHELP needs EMS if it is running as a shell program.</strong><p>
If you don't specify the +E parameter, POVHELP will come up as a stand-alone program, in which case it does not use EMS.<p>
If you highlight a section of code using Alt-Tab, and you are using POV-Help in pop-up mode, then you may paste the code via the keyboard buffer using 'P'.<p>
As many editors today use auto-indentation, this may cause some problems with column alignment. For that reason, POV-Help by default inserts a HOME key code into the keyboard buffer after each CR. Some editors require more than one HOME key operation to get to the left column. For this reason, the number of HOME's sent may be adjusted from 0 (none) to 9 using the +PH[n] command-line parameter. 'n' is any value from 0 to 9 and defaults to 1.<p>
