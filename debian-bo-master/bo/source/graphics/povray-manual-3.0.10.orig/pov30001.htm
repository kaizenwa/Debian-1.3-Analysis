Section 2.3.6<br>All Versions</h3></center>
Each executable archive includes full documentation for POV-Ray itself as well as specific instructions for using POV-Ray with your type of platform.<p>
All versions of the program share the same ray-tracing features like shapes, lighting and textures. In other words, an IBM-PC can create the same pictures as a Cray supercomputer as long as it has enough memory.<p>
The user will want to get the executable that best matches their computer hardware. See the section <a href="pov30001.htm#ref 19 pri 0">&quot;Where to Find POV-Ray Files&quot;</a> for where to find these files. You can contact those sources to find out what the best version is for you and your computer.<hr>
<a name="ref 38 pri 0"><a name="ref 39 pri 0"><center><h3><a name="section 2.3.7">
Section 2.3.7<br>Compiling POV-Ray</h3></center>
The following sections will help you to compile the portable C source code into a working executable version of POV-Ray. They are only for those people who want to compile a custom version of POV-Ray or to port it to an unsupported platform or compiler.<p>
The first question you should ask yourself before proceeding is <strong>Do  I really need to compile POV-Ray at all?</strong> Official POV-Ray Team executable versions are available for MS-DOS, Windows 3.1x/95/NT, Mac 68k, Mac Power PC, Amiga, Linux for Intel x86, and SunOS. Other unofficial compiles may soon be available for other platforms. If you do not intend to add any custom or experimental features to the program and if an executable already exists for your platform then you need not compile this program yourself.<p>
If you do want to proceed you should be aware that you are very nearly on your own. The following sections and other related compiling documentation assume you know what you are doing. It assumes you have an adequate C compiler installed and working. It assumes you know how to compile and link large, multi-part programs using a <b>make</b> utility or an IDE project file if your compiler supports them. Because makefiles and project files often specify drive, directory or path information, we cannot promise our makefiles or projects will work on your system. We assume you know how to make changes to makefiles and projects to specify where your system libraries and other necessary files are located.<p>
In general you should not expect any technical support from the POV-Ray Team on how to compile the program. Everything is provided here as is. All we can say with any certainty is that we were able to compile it on our systems. If it doesn't work for you we probably cannot tell you why.<p>
There is no technical documentation for the source code itself except for the comments in the source files. We try our best to write clear, well- commented code but some sections are barely commented at all and some comments may be out dated. We do not provide any technical support to help you to add features. We do not explain how a particular feature works. In some instances, the person who wrote a part of the program is no longer active in the Team and we don't know exactly how it works.<p>
When making any custom version of POV-Ray or any unofficial compile, please make sure you read and follow all provisions of our license in <a href="pov3002f.htm#ref 40 pri 0">&quot;Copyright&quot;</a>. In general you can modify and use POV-Ray on your own however you want but if you distribute your unofficial version you must follow our rules. You may not under any circumstances use portions of POV-Ray source code in other programs.<hr>

Section 2.3.7.1<br>Directory Structure</h3></center>
POV-Ray source code is distributed in archives with files arranged in a particular hierarchy of directories or folders. When extracting the archives you should do so in a way that keeps the directory structure intact. In general we suggest you create a directory called <b>povray3</b> and extract the files from there. The extraction will create a directory called <b>source</b> with many files and sub-directories.<p>
In general, there are separate archives for each hardware platform and operating system but each of these archives may support more than one compiler. For example here is the directory structure for the MS-DOS archive.<p>
<pre>
  SOURCE
  SOURCE\LIBPNG
  SOURCE\ZLIB
  SOURCE\MSDOS
  SOURCE\MSDOS\PMODE
  SOURCE\MSDOS\BORLAND
  SOURCE\MSDOS\DJGPP
  SOURCE\MSDOS\WATCOM
</pre>
<p>
The <b>source</b> directory contains source files for the generic parts of POV-Ray that are the same on all platforms. The <b>source\libpng</b> contains files for compiling a library of routines used in reading and writing PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image files. The <b>source\zlib</b> contains files for compiling a library of routines used by <b>libpng</b> to compress and uncompress data streams. All of these files are used by all platforms and compilers. They are in every version of the source archives.<p>
The <b>source\msDOS</b> directory contains all source files for the MS-DOS version common to all supported MS-DOS compilers. The <b>pmode</b> sub-directory contains source files for <b>pmode.lib</b> which is required by all MS-DOS versions. The <b>borland</b>, <b>djgpp</b>, and <b>watcom</b> sub-directories contain source, makefiles and project files for C compilers by Borland, DJGPP and Watcom.<p>
The <b>source\msDOS</b> directory is only in the MS-DOS archive. Similarly the Windows archive contains a <b>source\windows</b> directory. The Unix archive contains <b>source/unix</b> etc.<p>
The <b>source\msDOS</b> directory contains a file <b>cmpl_msd.doc</b> which contains compiling information specific to the MS-DOS version. Other platform specific directories contain similar <b>cmpl_xxx.doc</b> files and the compiler specific sub-directories also contain compiler specific <b>cmpl_xxx.doc</b> files. Be sure to read all pertinent <b>cmpl_xxx.doc</b> files for your platform and compiler.<hr>

Section 2.3.7.2<br>Configuring POV-Ray Source</h3></center>
Every platform has a header file <b>config.h</b> that is generally in the platform specific directory but may be in the compiler specific directory. Some platforms have multiple versions of this file and you may need to copy or rename it as <b>config.h</b>. This file is included in every module of POV-Ray. It contains any prototypes, macros or other definitions that may be needed in the generic parts of POV-Ray but must be customized for a particular platform or compiler.<p>
For example different operating systems use different characters as a separator between directories and file names. MS-DOS uses back slash, Unix a front slash or Mac a colon. The <b>config.h</b> file for MS-DOS and Windows contains the following:<p>
<listing>
  #define FILENAME_SEPARATOR ''
</listing>
<p>
which tells the generic part of POV-Ray to use a back slash.<p>
Every customization that the generic part of the code needs has a default setting in the file <b>source\frame.h</b> which is also included in every module after <b>config.h</b>. The <b>frame.h</b> header contains many groups of defines such as this:<p>
<listing>
  #ifndef FILENAME_SEPARATOR
  #define FILENAME_SEPARATOR '/'
  #endif
</listing>
<p>
which basically says <strong>if we didn't define this previously in</strong> <b>config.h</b> <strong>then here's a default value</strong>. See <b>frame.h</b> to see what other values you might wish to configure.<p>
If any definitions are used to specify platform specific functions you should also include a prototype for that function. The file <b>source\msDOS\config.h</b>, for example, not only contains the macro:<p>
<listing>
  #define POV_DISPLAY_INIT(w,h) MSDOS_Display_Init ((w), (h));
</listing>
<p>
to define the name of the graphics display initialization function, it contains the prototype:<p>
<listing>
  void MSDOS_Display_Init (int w, int h);
</listing>
<p>
If you plan to port POV-Ray to an unsupported platform you should probably start with the simplest, non-display generic Unix version. Then add new custom pieces via the <b>config.h</b> file.<hr>

Section 2.3.7.3<br>Conclusion</h3></center>
We understand that the above sections are only the most trivial first steps but half the fun of working on POV-Ray source is digging in and figuring it out on your own. That's how the POV-Ray Team members got started. We've tried to make the code as clear as we can.<p>
Be sure to read the <b>cmpl_xxx.doc</b> files in your platform specific and compiler specific directories for some more minor help if you are working on a supported platform or compiler.<p>
Good luck!<hr>
