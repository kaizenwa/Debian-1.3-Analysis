		- To-do list; things to be done RSN! -

I'm using this file as swap space for any ideas I (or other people)
have to improve zgv, so I don't lose them amongst all the other junk I
was dealing with at the time. Don't necessarily expect these soon, or
ever. Feel free to contribute any ideas you have for features - my
email address is in the README.


Put tnpic back in (will need to change the jpeg writing stuff to use
jpeg-5).

Support XBM/XPM.

Some kind of caching of thumbnail file reading/interpreting (latter
only applies in 16-col mode). Perhaps just save ones read already in
current dir? This could all be fairly hairy in some respects...

Allow 'P7' (xv thumbnail) files to be loaded/viewed as picture files.

Add file move/copy to zgv file select screen.

Try to add 4-bit mode support in the viewer, somehow.


[Everything below this point you should only hold your breath for if
you like turning blue.]

ANSIfy the code.

Pressing 'n' (normal) doesn't seem to keep the same centre, and this
is probably the expected behaviour. Should fix it.

A simple mechanism to allow zgv to read any file type for which there is a
image_type -> pbm/pgm/ppm filter. Would involve config file entries like
this:
	fileformat .pcx pcxtoppm %s
...should still be able to provide the hffunc stuff by using popen(), or
maybe ptys so stderr can be trapped too.
