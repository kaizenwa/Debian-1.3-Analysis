This file (CHANGES) documents the major changes to zgv since the last
release version (version 2.6).


New features added:

- PNG support. PNG is a new format primarily designed to replace GIF.
  It has better compression (still lossless), supports 24-bit, and has
  much more useful interlacing. It currently can't handle images with
  alpha channels, but it should - and as far as I can tell, does -
  handle everything else.

- '-i' option added, to ignore errors with PNG or GIF files. You
  should now be able to view files of all types as they download or
  are generated (see the description of the '-i' option in the man
  page for details). This is particularly effective with interlaced
  PNG files, where you can see a rough image after only 15% of the
  file has downloaded.


Bugfixes:

- A couple of memory leaks related to aborting the loading of a 24-bit
  image on an 8-bit display fixed.
