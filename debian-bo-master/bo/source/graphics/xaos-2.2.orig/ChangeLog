Version 2.2
      Fixes:
	o bug in palette changing code
	o more detections for various curses versions
	o small well hidden bug in reallocation algorithm discovered.
	o removed passing in registers to avoid compiler bug
	o now allows unzoom greater than MAX_INT again
	o symetry handling works for deeper unzooms too.
	o more test for owerflowing/underflowing of resolution.
	  so now produces garbage but does not crash(feature?)
	o more exact zooming/unzooming
	o better framerate handling
	o fixes for pgcc - do not generate faults..
      Cleanups:
	o char * -> unsigned char *
	o mkrealloctable
	o some optimizations for pipelining
	o cleaned code to compile with -pedantic -traditional -Wall
	o ugly interface-better menu code, drawing fractal etc..
	o all timing code changed to use timer library
	o approximation algorithm
	o functions called maximally once per frame are not inlined
	  anymore
	o created few directories for documentation etc..
	o Minor changes in color indexing
	o palette changing code
	o rewrote solid guessing
	o some variables in drivers structure changed to flags
      Speedups:
        o symetry handling code in mkrealloc table optimized a bit.
	  now is faster,shorter and does better job. :)
	o non x/y symetries disabled because they slowes down for now..
	o approximation algorithm optimized-lots of memory accesses 
	  avoided-great speedup..
	  now performs much better(16fps -> 18 on 486)
	  also small hidden bug discovered, pricing redesigned a bit
	  and loops simplified-divided into more loops
	  function is now longer.
	  Also taken special care to minimize number of PRICE calls
	  mkrealloc tables is not main problem anymore. Handles
	  correctly all situations I tryed and is quite fast.
	o approximation algorithm is now fixed point
	  sprprisingly very small speedup..(but much smaller code)
	o better newton and barnsley calculation routines
      New features:
	o added fast preview mode for julias (julia.c)
	o configure coprocesor on 386/gnuc
	o created timer library that allows nice timing. 
	  asynchronous operations and lots of other funny stuff..
	  Bad thing is that XaoS does not work anymore w/o function for
	  getting time in milisec/usec. Gettimeofday, ftime and plan9
	  /dev/msec are supported. Others can be added to timmers.c and
	  timmers.h. Please send me modified version
	o improved configure script
	o Added additional statistics functions good for testing of 
	  algorithm
	o lots of tests for speed done..(see doc/speed)
        o completly new calculatenewinterruptible. This function
	  acts like calculatenew but may be interrupted(using interrupt
	  varibale) and then makes image with lower resolution
	  This makes possible to reduce resolution on the fly if
	  required
	o approximation algorithm now works well with new 
	  calculatenewinterruptible
	o improved palette changing
	o Improved solid guessing for variable range instead of range 2
	  also another special loop w/o sg when sg impossible
	o do_fractal now supports both-interruptible/uninterruptible
	  modes
	o Added magnet fractal
	o Added julia form of newton(bit tricky but looks well)
	o Added julia form of octo
	o Added support for random dot stereograms
	o pass is now string-more readable informations
	o mailing lists (xaos,xaos-announce,xaos-devel) see doc/README
    Documentation changes:
        o new tutorial
	o new algorithm descriptions
	o new PROBLEMS file
	o new README.gcc file
	o new xaosman.txt file
	o updates for new versions
    UI Changes:
    	o improved speed detection in ministatus
	o added 'j' for julia modes
	o added 'd' for default palette
	o added 't' for fast calculation modes control
	o added 'g' for solid guessing options
	o added 'o' for rotating
	o added '0' for magnet
	o added 'e' for random dot stereogram
	o changed to use timer library
	o does not crash with deep unzooms
	o added support for palette rotating
	o extended timing stuff for suport sync timing group..
	  this group is called "quite" often..
	o added support for new resolution lowering feature
	o now operates with exact screen sizes-no more fractal 
	  deformations..
	o automatical detection of optimal framerate for new resolution
	  lowering algorithm
    X11 changes:
        o more sanity checking for mitshm initialization
	o Added support for rotating palette for private colormap
	  and truecolor modes. 8bpp pseudocolor w/o privatecolormap
	  is impossible..
	o Uses X' function for autodetection screen size in milimeters..
	  (is this reilable?)
    SVGA changes:
        o Waits for retrace before displaying..looks better
    curses changes:
    	o Use capital letter for G and E to avid collisions with ugly
	  interface
	o Compatible with ncurses w/o redrawwin
    MS-DOG,X11 and SVGA driver:
        o Added support for palette rotating
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1
        o >>>>FINALLY<<<< discovered and implemented PROVED TO BE 
	  OPTIMAL dynamical aproximation algorithm in linear time!!!
	  It is still bit slow..but it is here!
	  It should slow down at the begining but certainly speeds up
	  during zoom
	  Also allows deeper zoom
	o added out of memory checks to make xaos safer on non unix platforms
        o autopilot is now timed by same way as all other parts are.
	  Now will act same on all computers(I hope)
	o Memorry corruption bug fixed - it caused problems with ysizes not dividable
	  by 2 with some other strange situations.
	o New README.interface
	   This helps others to extend XaoS or use its routines
	   in their software
	o Added many sanity checking to make easy debugging of new ports
        o small cleanups (unused variables etc..)
	o minnor speedups
	o added OS/2 port(graphics 320x200 and text) By Thomas A. K. Kjaer
	o added macintosh support by Tapio K. Vocadlo (thanks)
	o added support for different scanline size than width. for Mac and X11 port
	  >>WARNING<< changes to driver API:alloc_buffers now returns line size(usually
	  width)
	o Thomas' email updated
	o Bit less agresive to gcc optimizer..no more compiler crashes..
	  I hope
    UI Changes:
        o <- and -> stops calculation
	o driver changing disabled when just one driver available
	o status line
	o minnor cleanups
    Plan 9 changes:
        o mkfile by Scott Schwartz
	o correct timming. Thanks to Niger Roles and others on 9fans list

	o hiddes mouse at resizes - do not cause crashes anymore
    X11 Changes:
        o private colormap support
	o Fixed freed memory accessing bug..
	o added switches:
	   -private
	   -usedefault
	   -nomitshm
	o improved autodetection of best available visual-if defaultvisual!=pseudocolor
	  try truecolor first..do not use truecolor visuals on pseudocolor displays(look
	  ugly)
	  also supports 8bpptruecolor, staticcolor and grayscale(untested)
	o Fixed bug in changing number of entries that caused problems on SGI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0
        o Configure script.
	o Added biomorph outcoloring mode
	o Compiles now with -O2 - no -O3 required..
	  but kept -O6 for invoking pgcc optimizations
	o Many changes to make binary file smaller...consts, static, no
	  inlines and so on..
	  about 10KB from full XaoS saved..
	o Long doubles automatically disabled on SunOs
	o added new curses based interface. Have you ever seen realtime 
	  256 color fractal zoomer with text based output? :)
	o Now just one compact binary for all available drivers
	o Faster startup..(three times)
	o Compiles w/o many warnings(except these in libraries and
	  implicit definitions) with -ansi -pedantic -traditional -Wall
	o Autopilot not detects "oscillating" and too deep zoom so it can work
	  to infinity...can run as demo w/o any user input..
	  also auto detects major changes done by user and reinitializes variables...
	  so it restarts after changing of fractal type and so on..
	o many many new bugs!
	  But remember! Its not bug! Its feature!
   Ugly interface changes:
        o Completely redesigned-hardware depended parts are now
	  coded as drivers with common interface-easier adding
	  of new architectures
	  but looks as ugly as in previous releases :)
	o Added changing of display driver on the fly
	o Displays calculation status
	o Possibility of interrupting calculation
	o Reduced size of output program
	  (for example SVGAlib version from 48 to 37)
	o speed changing is now with displaying of status..
	o all ports modified for new interface
	o better status informations
	o new keys:
	  '?'/'/' status information
	  'r'     recalculate
	  'z'     interrupt
	  'v'     driver change
	  ' '     Redraw screen(or display current calculation status)
	o new hyperugly text browser that displays long and interesting
	  help text
	o Command line options support. Now you may configure XaoS
	  quite well..(turn on autopilot, set iterations etc..)
	o Changes to make drivers non reentrant
   SVGAlib prot changes:
	o Ui_svga is now event handled. It does not stay in wait
	  loop anymore.
	o Keys are now buffered-no more problems with disabling
	  autopilot
	o Added command line option:
	   -mode to select graphics mode
	o Now handles text in xmodes w/o seg. faults
	o Fixed possible crash after resizing
	o for compatibility with old SVGAlib keeps old non event handled
	  keyboard interface....but not recommended at all!
   PLAN9 port changes:
        o During porting to new ui interface I found nasty bug in displaying.
	  Now plan9 port is IMWHO surprisingly fast. 8c produces quite good code.
	  still crashes in higher resolution and has color problems
	o added keys [,] for changing iterations and ;,' for speed
	o Better palette handling
   MS-DOS port changes:
   	o Keys are now buffered-no more problems with disabling
	  autopilot
	o Compiled using DJGPP 2.01. So many DJGPP's bugs fixed :)
   X11 port changes:
        o Fixed some bugs that caused troubles when memory is not zeroed..
	o Added support for 16bpp, 24bpp and 32bpp truecolor visuals
	o Fixed bug that caused possible crashes before freeing images
	  (resizing etc..)
	o Removed unnecessary INLINEs in xlib.c/xlib.h ..
	  makes binary size bit smaller.
   Algorithm revisions:
        o Many areas inside set are not calculated
	o realloc_t - most often used array is now 32byte aligned..
	o Better newton calculating code-math now optimized by hand.
	o Small fixes in symmetry handling code
	  also minor speedups
	o Mandelbrot calculation rewrote into 386 assembly..
	  less than 5% speedup :((( (gcc guys:good work! :)
	  note that this is only for Intel platforms-xaos is still
	  compatible with non Intel computers :)

	  because of out coloring bugs disabled for now..
	o Completely new reallocing algorithms. Now proved to be 
	  optimal
	  but because of ugly looking results returned back to original one
	  current algoritmus is just about 20% slower than hypothetical
	  optimal one..still trying :)
	o Assembler fast inlined memcpy...also just for 386+
	o Changed solid guessing method so it is up to 20% more effective
	  in hope that no more mistakes introduced
	  startup speed on 486 was reduced from 6 seconds to 4
	  in fact it seems to make less errors than previous one :)
	o Small changes in Barnsley code
	o Minor fixes in symmetry code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2
   New features:
	o New recalculating with non rectangular pixels. (for full screen modes)
	  great for modes X :)
	o New palette with white background
	o Added coprocessor configuration into MS-DOS port - some coloring
	  modes are MUCH faster because of no more SIGFPE ignoring..
	o Added support for 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 into MS-DOS port
	o Default type changed back to double because long double is
	  non standard
	o 9x15 font changed to more compatible and better looking fixed.
	o First release of plan9 port (very interesting OS see
	    http://plan9.att.com..trial version if free)-not 
	    complete yet..colors looks ugly and keys like 
	    arrows does not work.. 

	    someone who can help me?

	o Added key defines for old SVGAlib compatibility.

   Fixes:
	o Fixed bug that caused problems on dos configuration with
	  lot of free memory :)
	o Fixed symmetry handling in binary decomposition+lambda planes
	o fixed some bugs that caused core dumps on non Intel
	    architectures
	o Floating point exception is now ignored-no more
	    problems with random overflowing...(but great slowdown
	    in cases that caused sigfpe)
	o lots of cleanups for plan9 cc.
	o Width of font is autodetected. fixed problems with
	    non-standard X servers
	o Avoided pgcc bug that caused wrong calculating of octo fractal
	o Fixed color inside set(not fixed 0)
	o Fixed color handling in X11
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1
	o Removed unusable fixedpoint routines(386 users - go back to 1.0!)
	o New planes (toggled by pressing "i")
		- mu		(normal complex plane)
		- 1/mu		(inversed)
		- 1/(mu+0.25)
		- lambda
		- 1/lambda
		- 1/(lambda-1)
		- 1/(mu-1.40115)
	o Symmetry code completely redesigned
	o Added "m" into help
	o Better approximation algorithm in "mkrealloctable";
	  now it is about twice faster with a small zooming step
	o Approximation in approximation for yet better..also twice faster
	o Lots of cleanups
	o port for MS-DOG called chappi
	o Default palette is now same at all architectures
	o Some memory overflowing fixes(oops)
	o Fixed some divisions by zero
	o Number_t clean-allows deeper zoom for long doubles
