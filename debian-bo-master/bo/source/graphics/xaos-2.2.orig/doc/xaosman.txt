XaoS(6)                       Demos                       XaoS(6)


NAME
       XaoS - Fast real-time fractal zoomer


SYNOPSIS
       xaos [options]


DESCRIPTION
       XaoS  is  a  real-time interactive fractal zoomer for X11,
       SVGAlib, OS/2, DOS, Plan9 and Macintosh but it can be eas-
       ily ported to all architectures where graphics library and
       _GOOD_ optimizing ANSI c compiler (i.e. gcc) is available.
       It  displays  the  Mandelbrot set (among other escape time
       fractals) and allows you zoom smoothly into  the  fractal.
       Various  coloring  modes  are provided for both the points
       inside and outside the selected set. In addition,  switch-
       ing  between  Julia  and Mandelbrot fractal types and dis-
       playing planes is provided. The first version was a poorly
       written Mandelbrot view by Thomas later modified by Jan to
       support high  frame-rate  zooming.  Other  additions  were
       later  made  including autopilot (for those of you without
       drivers licenses), palette changing, GIF saving, and frac-
       tal  inversion.  More  informations  should be obtained by
       pressing 'h' in XaoS


OPTIONS
       XaoS' options should be divided into following parts:

        Ugly interface options
              This options are common for  all  installations  of
              XaoS  because  only  interface available for now is
              ugly interface.

        Driver selection options
              This options lets you choose graphics driver.

        Driver depended options
              This options depends on available drivers. In  this
              manual page are described just drivers for Unix and
              Linux.

SCREEN SIZE OPTIONS
       Knowedge of exact screen size needs XaoS  to  make  random
       dot  stereograms and choosing good view areas for fractal.
       This should be done by two ways.  Choosing screen size  or
       choosing  pixel  size.  Screen size is best for fullscreen
       drivers where resolution(so pixel size) should be changed.
       At the other hand pixel size is best for windowed envireo-
       ments where some kind of virtual screen etc should confuse
       calculation of pixel size from screen size.

       -screenwidth
              exact size of screen in centimeters

       -screenheight
              exact size of screen in centimeters

       -pixelwidth
              exact size of pixel in centimeters

       -pixelheight
              exact size of pixel in centimeters

FRACTAL FORMULA OPTIONS
       Following  options  let  you  specify with fractal formula
       will be used as default:

       -mandel

       -mandel3
              Mandelbrot set power 3 fractal

       -mandel4

       -mandel5
              Mandelbrot set power 5 fractal

       -mandel6

       -phoenix
              Start with Phoenix fractal

       -magnet
              Start with Magnet fractal

FRACTAL OPTIONS
       Using following options you may  specify  various  fractal
       parameters

       -iter  Select number of iterations

       -incoloring
              Select incoloring mode(use same number as in inter-
              active menu)

       -outcoloring
              Select  outcoloring  mode(use  same  number  as  in
              interactive menu)

       -plane Select  plane(use  same  number  as  in interactive
              menu)
       -fastdrawing
              Select fast drawing  mode(use  same  number  as  in
              interactive menu)

       -guessing
              Select  solid  guessing range(use same number as in
              interactive menu)

UGLY INTERFACE OPTIONS
       Using following  options  you  may  control  default  ugly
       interface setting

       -autopilot
              Enable autopilot

       -speed Zooming speed (default is 1)

       -config
              Display configuration options and exit.


DRIVER SELECTION OPTIONS
       Every  xaos  installation  has  some graphics driver. This
       depends on used operating system, available libraries  and
       configuration. XaoS by default tries to enable best avail-
       able driver. So it for example  in  Linux  case  it  tests
       drivers in following order:
       SVGAlib
       X11
       curses
       Following options are used to control this operation:

       -driver
              This  options  lets  you  specify driver to use and
              avoid autodection.

       -list  List available drivers and then exit.


SVGALIB DRIVER OPTIONS
       This driver is available just for  Linux/Intel  and  maybe
       Linux/alpha  platforms.  It lets XaoS to work full-screen.
       It looks much better that small X11 window,  because  XaoS
       can  choose resolution. At the other hand it requires root
       privileges.  If you want to start XaoS as normal user  you
       need to login as root first and than do:
       chown root xaos
       chmod +s xaos
       In  case  of  incorrectly  configured  SVGAlib  (see  file
       /etc/vga/libvga.conf or /usr/local/lib/libvga.conf) it can
       crash system. Following options are available:

       -mode  Select  graphics mode(same number as in interactive
              menu)


X11 DRIVER OPTIONS
       This driver is available on most Unix platforms.  It  sup-
       ports  MIT  shm extension but works well (but slower) on X
       servers  without  it.   Requires  8bpp   pseudo-color   or
       16,24,32 bpp true-color visual. Following options are sup-
       ported:

       -size  Select size of window (WIDTHxHEIGHT)

       -sync  This fixes troubles with one old HP-UX R4 X  server
              -  it did not generated keys and mouse events while
              it was displaying. So I added this flag that forces
              sync  before reading evets. It takes some time to X
              server to generate events.

       -private
              Use private colormap. This works  only  on  pseudo-
              color displays.

       -usedefault
              Use  default visual. Normally XaoS tryes to autode-
              tect best available one.  But sometimes  it  should
              choose wrong one. So try this in case of problems

       -nomitshm
              Disable mitshm extensions. Try this in case you are
              getting error messages after  startup  or  resizing
              XaoS window.


CURSES DRIVER OPTIONS
       This  driver uses text only output so it works on all text
       terminals that are curses capable. (most modern one.  Like
       vt100)  This  is  one  of most powerful drivers. Following
       options should be used to tune xaos setting for your  ter-
       minal:

       -normal
              Enable use of normal text

       -nonormal
              Disable use of normal text

       -dim   Enable use of dim attribute(half bright)

       -nodim Disable use of dim attribute(half bright)

       -bold  Enable use of bold attribute(double bright)

       -nobold
              Disable use of bold attribute(double bright)

       -boldfont
              Enable use of bold attribute(bold font)

       -noboldfont
              Disable use of bold attribute(bold font)

       -reverse
              Enable use of reversed text

       -noreverse
              Disable use of reversed text

       -reverse
              Enable use of reversed text

       -noreverse
              Disable use of reversed text

       -fontheight
              Set font height(8 or 16)
