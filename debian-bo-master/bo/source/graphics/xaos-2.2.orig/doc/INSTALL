For Unix/X11:

   XaoS now have configure script so following should work correctly:

        CFLAGS=(your best optimizing switches)
	export CFLAGS

	   #note that this two steps are not required on pc/Linux
           #and on all gcc compilers XaoS uses quite good switches.
           #but this is REQUIRED for other compilers, because XaoS
           #is coded to be good target for optimizer and NEEDS to
           #be optimized to work in reasonable speed

	./configure [options...usually not required]
	make

   For better results:
   Edit config.autoconf to reflect your system. 

   NOTE:
   On some sun long double is detected and used but it is incredibly 
   slow (probably because of software emulation). Edit config.autoconf
   file and change FPOINT_TYPE to double. Other computers may require 
   event set it to float to get reasonable speed.

   options available:
     By default XaoS will try to configure and compile following drivers
      X11
      SVGAlib
      Curses
     This may cause some problems. To reduce binary file size and/or
     solve such problems you may disable driver using:
      --with-x11-driver=no     to disable X11 driver
      --with-svga-driver=no    to disable SVGAlib driver
      --with-curses-driver=no  to disable (N)Curses driver
     There may be problems with configuring bit non standard curses
     library. You may use following options:
      --with-sunos-curses     Used to force SunOS 4.x curses
      --with-osf1-curses	Used to force OSF/1 curses
      --with-vcurses[=incdir] Used to force SysV curses
      --with-ncurses[=base-dir] Compile with ncurses/locate base dir
      --with-x                use the X Window System
     Also finding X includes should be problem.
      --x-includes=DIR        X include files are in DIR
      --x-libraries=DIR       X library files are in DIR
     For Linux gpm library use:
      --with-gpm-mouse=base-dir  Specifies the base gpm directory


For DOS:
   You need djgpp gnu compiler and allegro graphics
   library. Use:

	make -f Makefile.dos
For Mac:
    Read README.mac for more informations
You may also get binary distribution.
