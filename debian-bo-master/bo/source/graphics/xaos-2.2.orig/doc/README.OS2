This is the OS/2 port of the Unix program xaos. It was done using emx/gcc
and is licensed by GPL. The original development was done by Jan Hubicka and
Thomas Marsh on Linux.

The OS/2 version uses the old 16-bit APIs Mou, Vio & Kbd, which means it 
should run on OS/2 v2.x, 3.x, 4.x, but not on 1.x since everything else
is 32-bit.

XAOS OS/2 requires the emx runtime package emxrt.zip, but this distribution
contains the required DLL's. If you want the whole package or just want to 
upgrade to the newest emx distribution, you can get emxrt.zip via 
anonymous ftp on

  ftp.uni-stuttgart.de [129.69.18.15]: /pub/systems/os2/emx-0.9c
  ftp-os2.cdrom.com:  [192.153.46.2]:  /pub/os2/unix/emx09c
  src.doc.ic.ac.uk     [146.169.2.1]:  /packages/os2/unix/emx09c
  ftp.leo.org        [131.159.0.198]:  /pub/comp/os/os2/devtools/emx+gcc

XAOS OS/2 was compiled with emx09c, which you also can get from the
above ftp sites.

XAOS OS/2 supports two screen modes:

	1) VIO full screen mode 13, which is 320x200x256
	2) Pure TEXT mode, which can run full screen or on the desktop

Starting the VIO version must be done either from a full screen OS/2 commando
prompt, from a desktop object in which 'OS/2 full Screen' is set in the session
section of the properties or it can be started from an OS/2 commando prompt 
with 'start /fs xaos'.

For other options, type 'xaos -help'

YES! I managed to get the Mou API working when running in VIO full screen
mode 13!!!! Well it was really hard work, but the result is very nice....

NOTE: On OS/2 Warp 4.x turn off the 'Mouse Actions' when running the text
version in a window. Press mouse button 2, and select 'Mouse Actions'.

I'm also working on getting XAOS OS/2 working in higher resolutions, like
640x480x256 or even 800x600x256! but that might take a while for me to do.

I haven't experienced any problem switching to the desktop, while running
XAOS OS/2, but it might cause a lockup on OS/2.
