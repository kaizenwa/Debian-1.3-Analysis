INTRODUCTION:
	XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer.
	It displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time 
	fractals) and allows you zoom smoothly into the fractal.  
	Various coloring modes are provided for both the points inside 
	and outside the selected set. In addition, switching between 
	Julia and Mandelbrot fractal types and displaying planes is 
	provided. The first version was a poorly written Mandelbrot 
	view by Thomas later modified by Jan to support high frame-rate 
	zooming. Other additions were later made including autopilot 
	(for those of you without drivers licenses), palette changing, 
	GIF saving, and fractal inversion.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS(for now)
        UNIXES:
	  X11 (8bpp pseudocolor 8,15,16,24,31 truecolor, StaticGray and 
	       StaticColor only)
	  Curses (yes! text mode version available!)
          Linux/SVGAlib (svgalib 1.2.10 or newer recomended)
	OTHER OS:
	plan9 (8bpp displays only)
	MS-DOS (djgpp/allegro - supports VESA 2.0/1.0, 
	                        VGA - 320x200 and X modes, 
				S3, Cirrus, ET4000 in
				resolutions 256x256-1200x1600)
	Macintosh (displays with 8bit support only)
	OS/2 (320x200 mode 13 and text mode)
	Amiga (256 workbench displays only)

REQUIREMENTS:
	XaoS uses floating point math for its calculations. This may 
	be slow on some computers. The program was developed on 
	a Pentium running at 120 MHz, but it can work quite well (20fps)
	on 486Dx/2. I also received nice letters from users using 
	XaoS at 386/40 or so. Coprocessor is _REALLY_ required.
	Faster computer is better so alpha/600MHZ recomended.  

	To compile XaoS you need ANSI compliant compiler with _GOOD_ 
	optimizations.  Unix version uses configure script. Other 
	platforms uses different ways.  GNU CC is highly recommended. 
	Graphics drivers usually have some additional requirements. 
	(for example xlib for X11, djgpp and allegro for dos port)
	Also fast malloc/free routines are recomended because they
	are called quite often (10 times per frame)

MAILING-LIST:
	XaoS now have following mailing lists at 
	majordomo@horac.ta.jcu.cz

	xaos
	  this list is for general xaos discusion 
	  (ideas, questions, bugreports..)
	xaos-announce
	  keeps you informed about new versions
	xaos-devel
	  you want to become XaoS developer? Subscribe here and
	  let us know about you! You will be welcomed.
	To subscribe send following message to

INSTALL:
	Installation methods are described in the file "INSTALL".

USAGE:
	Since version 2.0 XaoS have lots of command line options. 
	They are depend on its configuration, available drivers etc.
	See xaos -h for full help. Usually more than one driver is
	available. XaoS after startup tries to auto-detect best one.
	For example in Linux case tests driver in following order:
	  SVGAlib
	  X11/MITSHM and then X11
	  curses
	If you want to force text display instead of graphics you may
	use -driver curses. Use xaos -list for list of all available
	drivers.
