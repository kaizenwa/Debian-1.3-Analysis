Title:          XaoS - fast protable real-time interactive fractal zoomer.
Version:        1.0
Entered-date:   Jul 25 1996

Description:    
		XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer.
		and SVGAlib. It displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape
		time fractals) and allows you zoom smoothly into the fractal.
		Various coloring modes are provided for both the points inside 
		and outside the selected set. In addition, switching between 
		Julia and Mandelbrot fractal types is provided. The first 
		version was a poorly written Mandelbrot view by Thomas later 
		modified by Jan to support high frame-rate zooming. Other 
		additions were later made including autopilot (for those of 
		you without drivers licenses), palette changing, GIF saving, 
		and fractal inversion.
