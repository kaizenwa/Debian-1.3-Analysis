They figure files have been compressed to save space.  To uncompress them use
the command "uncompress *" or "uncompress filename" for individual files.

The have also been uuencoded so that they may be mailed to comp.sources.x
without any problem with the ^A (control A) in the text objects.

To decode them (if you don't have the .fig files), either run the csh script
DECODE or do the following:

for csh:

foreach file (*.uu)
   uudecode $file
end

or for ksh:

for file in *.uu
do
    uudecode $file
done


Then uncompress them.
