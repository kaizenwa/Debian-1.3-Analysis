The following are applications which can produce Fig files as their output:

************************************************************************
mifXfig - MIF to XFig and XFig to MIF Converter 
	see http://www.ida.liu.se/~vaden/teaching/m2f/ for details, but it
	basically converts to and from MIF and Fig files
	From Vadim Engelson (vaden@ida.liu.se)
************************************************************************
pstoedit - converts Postscript(TM) files to other vector graphic formats
	that can be edited. Besides Fig output, tgif, Framemaker(TM) (MIF-
	format) and flattened PostScript are supported along with several
	others.
	You need a C++ compiler to install and GhostScript to run pstoedit.
	pstoedit should run on all Un*x like systems and has also been ported
	to OS/2 and DOS.
	The newest version as of this writing (9 Jul 1996) is 2.41 and is
	available from:

	ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/tgif/pstoedit/pstoedit.2.41.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/tgif/pstoedit/pstoedit.2.41.tar.gz
	ftp://bourbon.cs.ucla.edu/pub/pstoedit/pstoedit.2.41.tar.gz

hp2xx - converts HPGL to EPS, LaTex, Fig or simplified HPGL converter
	From Ian MacPhedran <macphed@engr.USask.Ca> in 
	ftp://ftp.engr.usask.ca/pub/hp2xx/

************************************************************************
xgraph - plotting package for X - version on iworks.ecn.uiowa.edu in
	comp.hp has version that can output Fig files

************************************************************************
gnuplot - Plotting package; can output in Fig format.
	For the location of gnuplot, here is the (paraphrased) excerpt from
	the FAQ.  Note, that although there are versions of gnuplot for
	several different platforms, xfig only runs under X11.

	The official distribution site for the gnuplot source is dartmouth.edu,
	in /pub/gnuplot.  Official mirrors of that distribution are (for
	Australia) monu1.cc.monash.edu.au and (for Europe) irisa.irisa.fr.
	You can also get it from your friendly neighbourhood comp.sources.misc
	archive.

	MS-DOS and MS-Windows binaries are available from oak.oakland.edu
	(North America) as pub/msdos/plot/gpt34*.zip, garbo.uwasa.fi (Europe)
	as /pc/plot/gpt34*.zip and archie.au (Australia) as
	micros/pc/oak/plot/gpt34*.zip.  The files are: gpt34doc.zip,
	gpt34exe.zip, gpt34src.zip and gpt34win.zip.

	OS/2 2.x binaries are at ftp-os2.nmsu.edu in /os2/2.x/unix/gnu/gplt34.zip.

	Amiga sources and binaries are available from wuarchive.wustl.edu
	as /pub/amiga/aminet/util/gnu/gnuplot-3.4*; there are numerous mirrors
	of this distribution.

	The NeXTSTEP front end can be found at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and
	cs.orst.edu.

	A version for OS-9/68K can be found at cabrales.cs.wisc.edu in
	/pub/OSK/GRAPHICS; it includes both an X and non - X versions.

	A version of gnuplot for the Macintosh is included in the gpcontrb
	file, or can be found at wuarchive.wustl.edu in
	edu/math/mac/graphingAids, as MacGnuPlot3.2.sea.hqx and
	MacGnuPlotPackage3.2.sea.hqx.

************************************************************************
pic2fig - converts PIC (used with troff/ditroff/etc) to Fig.
	May be found at ftp.cs.orst.edu in /localsrc/graphics and
	at ftp.x.org in /contrib/utilities.

plot2fig - converts Unix PLOT language to Fig

This is the README file for plot2fig.

plot2fig is a utility for converting unix plot files into the fig file format.
fig files may be editied using fig, or xfig.  They can be converted to other
formats using the transfig package.

A copy of the GNU General Public License is in the file named COPYING. See it
for copyright, license, warranty and distribution details.

This software has yet to be thoroughly tested.  Any comments or bug fixes
would be greatly appreciated.  Please send them to rich@rice.edu.

cdraw2fig - converts cdraw to Fig

Here is the cdraw README file:

cdraw2fig translates pictures from "Cheap Draw" format to Fig format.
The TransFig package can then be used for translation to the desired
output format.  Currently supported formats include PIC, (E)EPIC, LaTeX,
PostScript, and several others.

cdraw2fig is implemented in the awk programming language.  Most Cheap
Draw operations are handled in some way, although some of the transla-
tions are somewhat arbitrary.  Note that some output formats are con-
siderably less expressive than Cheap Draw (and Fig).  PIC, for example,
supports neither shading or rotated text.  In addition, precise text
spacing is problematic across the different output formats.

The following files are included in this distribution:

       README          - this file
       cdraw2fig.uu    - ksh script with self-contained awk program
                         (uuencoded)
       example         - sample "Cheap Draw" file (from the original
                         Cheap Draw distribution)

To translate a Cheap Draw file to PIC (for example):

       $ cdraw2fig example > example.fig
       $ fig2dev -Lpic example.fig > example.pic

Cheap Draw 2.0 was written by Bob Pratt and is available from the UNIXPC
archives at osu-cis.
