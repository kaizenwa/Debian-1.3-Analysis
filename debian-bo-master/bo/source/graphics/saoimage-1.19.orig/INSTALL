To build SAOimage, type make, followed by the name of the architecture/OS 
which you are using, as chosen from the following table:

   % make aix		# IBM RS/6000 running AIX
   % make alliant	# Alliant FX series
   % make alpha		# DEC Alpha AXP Digital Unix
   % make apollo	# Any Apollo, software floating point
   % make apollo_68882	# Apollo for MC68882 fp
   % make apollo_fpa	# Apollo for FPA1
   % make apollo_prism	# Apollo for PRISM architecture (a88k)
   % make hp		# HP-UX
   % make linux		# Intel PC running Linux
   % make mips		# MIPStation running RISCOS
   % make sgi		# SGI Personal Iris running Irix
*  % make solaris	# Sun Sparcstation, Solaris + X11
*  % make sun		# Sun Sparcstation, SunOS + X11
   % make ultrix	# DECstation and VAXstation

* Switch makefile.sunow and makefile.solow if using Sun OpenWindows.

The full "make install" both installs SAOimage in Unix and sets up for
communications with IRAF:
     % make install
(or, % make install SAOBINDIR = "/ourown/local/bindir")

Partial installs may also be used:
    % make install_saobin	# just install binary (can add SAOBINDIR)
    % make install_saoman	# just install manual page
    % make install_fifo	# just install iraf fifo's
    % make install_imtoolrc	# just install iraf imtoolrc file

NOTICE: You can't run the installation targets from the umbrella makefile.
You must run the correct makefile.<machine> for the workstation you are
installing on.  For instance,

    % make -f makefile.dec install

Other options:
    % make manual	# make manual.dvi file in doc subdirectory
    % make clean	# clean up object & miscellaneous other files
    % make tar		# make saoimage.tar in CWD
    % make -s pipe	# create tarfile on stdout for piping
    % make tape		# create tarfile on /dev/nrxt8

 Make macros (parameters) that can be specified on command line:
	SAOBINDIR		# Destination directory for SAOimage program
	SAOMANDIR		# Destination directory for on-line manpage
	ARCFILE			# Disk archive file name (used with make tar)
	TAPEDEV			# Tape archive device name (used with make tape)
