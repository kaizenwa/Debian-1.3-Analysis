                         USENIX Picons Database

This directory contains face images of Usenix conference attendees.
It is a direct conversion of the Usenix FaceSaver project's face image
collection available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/published/usenix/faces/ into
picons database format.  This collection was last updated Oct 1994 with
images taken at the USENIX LISA VIII conference in San Diego.  See the
FAQ file in this directory for complete information about picons and
the use of this database.  See the .index file for a listing of this
database's picons.

The Usenix FaceSaver collection was built through the volunteer efforts of
Barb Dijker <barb.dijker@labyrinth.com>, Lou Katz and others.  "Usenix"
is a registered trademark of the USENIX Association.  "FaceSaver" is a
registered trademark of Metron Computerware Ltd of Oakland, CA.
