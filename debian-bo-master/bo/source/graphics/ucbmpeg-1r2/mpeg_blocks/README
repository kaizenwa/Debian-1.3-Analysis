This directory contains a public domain MPEG video software
analyzer.  It operates by playing a video stream in one window, while
another window displays the block type and motion vectors for each block in
the current frame.

The decoder implements the standard described in the Committee 
Draft ISO/IEC CD 11172 dated December 6, 1991 which is
sometimes refered to as "Paris Format." The code has been
compiled and tested on the following platforms:


 HP PA-RISC (HP/UX 8.X, X11R4) (i.e., HP 9000/7XX and 9000/3XX)
 Sun Sparc (SunOS 4.X, X11R5)

This directory contains everything required to build and
display video. We have included source code, a makefile, 
installation instructions, and a man page. Data files can
be obtained from the same ftp site this was located in.
See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to
compile and run mpeg_blocks.
