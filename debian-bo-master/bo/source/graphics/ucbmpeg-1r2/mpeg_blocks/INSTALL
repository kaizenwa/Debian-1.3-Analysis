These are the instructions for compiling mpeg_blocks, the software MPEG
blocks analyzer.

1) Untar the file mpeg_blocks1.0.tar.gz. and invoking the command:

	zcat mpeg_blocks1.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -

2)  Customize the Makefile for your particular needs.

In the Makefile the CFLAGS definition is multiply defined for a couple of
different machines, uncomment the one you want to use, or define your own
if necessary. 

The INCLUDEDIR variable should be set to include the paths leading to the
standard header files such as stdio.h as well as to X11/Xlib.h  (on most
systems, this is /usr/include).  To do this set the INCLUDEDIR variable to
-I followed by the pathname. For example, if the path is /usr/local/include,
edit the Makefile to look like this:

	INCLUDEDIR       = -I/usr/local/include

If more than one pathname is necessary, simply prepend -I to each path.
For example if you needed to include /usr/local/include and /usr/X11/include,
the variable definition would look like:

	INCLUDEDIR       = -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/X11/include

Finally, make sure the LIBS variable is set to the path and name of your 
Xext and X11 librarys. For example:

	LIBS             = /usr/lib/X11/libXext.a /usr/lib/X11/libX11.a

or 
	LIBS = -lXext -lX11

3) Type make clean; make all

4) To remove .o files, type make clean

5) Try it out! You can ftp some sample data files from the same site
   you got this player from. Data files usually end in .mpg or .mpeg
   The command line for the player is described in the man page, but
   is basically:

   mpeg_blocks filename


When you know where to install it, you must copy show.tcl and
and the directory bitmaps to it (say /usr/local/lib/mpeg_blocks), change the
directory in the makefile, and remake.
