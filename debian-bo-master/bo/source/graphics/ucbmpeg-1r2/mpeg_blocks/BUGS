Reporting bugs:
    Since this is the first release, I am expecting a lot of bugs to
    occur. If you find any bugs in this software, please send them to
    mpeg-bugs@plateau.cs.berkeley.edu.  Since this software
    is unsupported, we make no guarantees about how long it will
    take to fix the bug, or if it will be fixed at all.  Bug fixes
    will be cheerfully accepted.  Please include as much detailed
    information as possible, including:

        1) the version number of the program you are using (cf. VERSION)
        2) the data file that caused the bug (if possible)
        3) the OS version and machine type you ran the program on
        4) the compiler used to compile the program

Known bugs:


    - Rewind is broken.
    - I/P frames are switched (stream vs display order)
    - Pressing play on the last frame results in a failed end code
          find message and core dumps.
    - Crashes on a floating exception on DEC OSF machines.
    - why does play have to be hit twice to start?
