Post 2.2 Changes
----------------
bit rate max of 1.44Mbps for constrained param changed to 1.856Mbps
bug in printing "full/half fixed" for first 2 frames
added temporal ref printing to block file
fixed block2spec to generate good specs files
handles sequence_error_codes
notices bad mb_incrs in I frames

Changes 2.1 -> 2.2
------------------
= BUG FIXES
	- End code sometimes treated as Packet, causing infinite loop
		in system layer streams, fixed
	- Double prining of "Successful parse..." fixed (now only with
		-DANALYSIS and only once then)
	- Cr/Cb misnamed bug fixed
	- slices/frames numbered from 0 (still in stream order)

= NEW FEATURES
	- some temporal reference checking and better paring printing
		(thanks to "Paul A. Kaiser" <pak@unx.sas.com>)
        - -verify does further verification of streams (no -verify is faster)
	- -histtogram record the overall frame information for each type
           into histograms (like mpeg_play -ANALYZE or mpeg_stat 1.0)
	- ^C now makes it print the stats instead of just exiting, useful
           for when you start a long mpeg, but just wanted summary info.
        - Checks for illegal motion vectors
	- Verifies constrained parameter setting / explains why fails
           (other than VBV)
	- -dct now adds the deocded coefficients into block info file
	   (mega data, but useful for debugging encoders....)
	- can dump userdata into a file

= MAINTENANCE
	- Displays GOP based order	
	- Indents system layer log
        - block_info file now has just block number for block lines

= PORTABILITY
	- added -DSIGNAL_ONE_PARAM to make the signal compile right


Changes 2.0 -> 2.1
------------------
= BUG FIXES
	- finds regular patterns which are not initial 
		(like extracts from an MPEG)
        - No IOT trap on bad huffman decodes anymore

= NEW FEATURES
	- Put decoder timer info into option, as usually no one cares
	- Made -syslog an option
	- added measure of number/percent of coded blocks in P/B macroblocks
	- added some convertion tools to turn output files into
		compouter-readable form
	- better error handling code

= MAINTENANCE
        - Moved while in main into mpegVidRsrc
	- nuked spelling errors in man page
	
= PORTABILITY



Changes 1.0 -> 2.0
------------------
= BUG FIXES
	- cleaned up dead code
	- Qscale measure much improved (not just last qscale)
	- now can analyze initial B's in sequence
	- Frames with exactly 0 mod 100 (MB_QUANTUM) macroblocks now are
		analyzed

= NEW FEATURES
	- Handles system layer streams
	- Prints custom Quant table info.
	- New options:
		-start, -end  for limited analysis
		-quiet to shut it up
		-qscale to do a histogram of Qscale changes
		-size_info to write frame sizes to a file
		-block_info to get really detailed info on macroblocks
		-offsets to record bit offsets in the file (for primitive
			editing)
		-rate to capture a per-frame detail on bit rate
		-ratelength to change period for -rate
		-all to turn on all the options
	- '-' is a legal file name (for stdin/out)
	- man page
	- prints more requested parameters
	- prints bit rate info
	- better error messages on invalid parts of sequences
		(for validation uses)
	- displays user_data in sequence headers
	- skipped macroblocks counts (thanks Paul A. Kaiser <pak@unx.sas.com>)

= MAINTENANCE
        - removed dead code/flags
	- fixed some averages

= PORTABILITY
	- added #ifdef LINUX'es to ease porting
