1) On most machines (with gcc), just type "make"

    If you wish to use the HP-UX cc compiler, sample flags are in the Makefile.
    On SunOS, cc works with no changes (other than CC)

    If you are missing isprint or strdup, see the file porting.c

2) Copy mpeg_stat and mpeg_stat.1 into appropriate places
 
3) If you get a warning like:
main.c:533: warning: passing arg 2 of `signal' from incompatible pointer type
then add -DSIG_ONE_PARAM to CFLAGS in the Makefile
(or just ignore it)
