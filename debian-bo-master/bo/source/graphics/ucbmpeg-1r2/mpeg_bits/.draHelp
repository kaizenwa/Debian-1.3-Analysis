.ft title Help for drawing tools....\n
.ft sdout for dbDraw, by Doug Banks\n
\n
.ft sdout dbDraw
 provides a button bar on the far left of the screen which offers a number
 of tools for creating and manipulating items on the canvas.\n
.ft sechd \n1. Select\n
The arrow button allows users to select items by clicking on or near them.
  Selected items have a bounding box drawn around them.  A selected item
 can then be moved by drop-and-drag with the selection cursor, and can
 also be manipulated by making selections from the 
.ht .ediHelp Edit
 menu.\n
.ft sechd \n2. Move\n
The hand button brings up a spiral cursor that allows the user to scroll
 around in the canvas with drop-and-drag.  This does not affect the contents
 of the canvas, but only the portion of it that is currently visible: 
.ht .filHelp Save
 and 
.ht .filHelp Print
 depend on the current contents of the canvas, not the viewport.\n
.ft sechd \n3. Text\n
The letter A button brings up a text insertion cursor that, once placed,
 allows the user to enter one line of text on the screen.\n
.ft sechd \n4. Shapes\n
The last four buttons allow the user to draw various shapes.  The
 filled polygon and the polyline are drawn by holding down the
 left mouse button while placing points with the right. (The first
 point is placed where you first press the left mouse).  Circles and
 arcs are drawn with the standard drop-and-drag interface.
