    will be cheerfully accepted.  Please include as much detailed
    information as possible, including:

	3) the OS version and machine type you ran the program on
	4) the compiler used to compile the program

Known bugs:

1. A series of abrupt changes in the stream being parsed, such as 
rewinds and opening new streams, has sometimes caused mpeg_bits to
crash.

2. In some tests mpeg_bits would exhaust the colormap, bringing up
a dialog warning of the problem.  Just click OK and proceed, but some
of the colors used, such as the color used to highlight selected items
in a dialog, are strange.

3. DEC OSF crashes with a floating exception.
