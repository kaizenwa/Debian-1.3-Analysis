These are the instructions for compiling mpeg_bits.

1) Untar the file mpeg_bits.tar.Z. This is best done by creating a new
directory for the files involved, moving the tar file into this directory
and invoking the command:

	zcat mpeg_bits-1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -
	(or gtar -zxvf mpeg_bits-1.0.tar.Z )

2) Customize the Makefile. Do this by editing the file
Makefile.  The Makefile explains in more detail how this should be done.

3) Type make clean; make all

4) To remove .o files, type make clean

5) This is for tcl 7.X/tk 3.X

When you know where to install it, you must copy the help files, show.tcl,
and the directory bitmaps to the library location, change the location in
the makefile, and recompile.
(the copy could be something like:
cp -r bitmaps *Help helpModule show.tcl /usr/local/etc/mpeg_bits
)
