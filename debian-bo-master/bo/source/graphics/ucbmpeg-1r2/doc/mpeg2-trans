Dear Internet readers:
 
The MPEG Committee MPEG-2 Systems Transport Layer validation bitstreams
(July 1994 edition) are now available via anonymous FTP. Also included
in the archive is a copy of Munsi Haque's draft ANSI-C source code for
Transport layer demultiplexing.
 
These bitstreams are not guaranteed to be 100% correct (especially
since the MPEG-2 Systems document, ISO/IEC 13818-1, is still undergoing
technical content changes), but they are produced by none other than
the world's experts on the subject.
