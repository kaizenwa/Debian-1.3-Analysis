When debugging a script which uses Net::FTP or Net::SMTP please try the
following

  Ensure you have the most upto date version of the libnet distribution
  from CPAN

  Try adding 'Debug => 1' to the constructor line and see if there is
  anything obvious in the transcript

  Failing that, and you belive it is a real libnet problem then mail the
  transcript to <bodg@tiuk.ti.com>. I run a mail filter here so I would
  appreciate the text Net:: to be in the subject.
