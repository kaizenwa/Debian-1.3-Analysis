	makefiles, for building on current systems.

Mon Dec  2 20:36:28 1996  Bill Schelter  <wfs@linux13.ma.utexas.edu>

	important for problems that use mv_ref methods..

	* fixes for format and structure printing.
	* fixes to calls to FEerror

	adjust-array or via output with string stream stuff

Mon Oct 30 20:42:17 1995  Bill Schelter  <wfs@jany.ma.utexas.edu>

	* o/print.d (BEGIN): fix (defstruct (foo (:print-function
                                	print-foo))  junk)
	  (defun print-foo (foo stream depth)
	       (format stream "#<foo ~S>" (foo-junk foo)))
         bug. [with the printStructBufp value being nulled]
	* add-defs sets TCL_LIBRARY, and gcltksrv sets it..
	* fixes to support solaris-i386 [in rsym_elf.c, sfaslelf.c
	* ./add-defs fix order of tests of paths...

Wed Oct 18 00:16:59 1995  Bill Schelter  <wfs@jany.ma.utexas.edu>

	* (format nil "~5,,X" 10) made to work.   Note the ansi draft
	neither condones nor prohibits this.   Normally the , is a place
	holder and there is a argument after the last , and then comes the
	directive.   Here the commas dont hold a place.  

	* fix bv.bv_offset problem... the move to 64 bit machines caused
	it to be impossible to have some structure fields overlap the way
	they once did.    added BV_OFFSET(x) and SET_BV_OFFSET(x,val)
	macros.
	* fix add-defs to make clxsocket.o not be compiled in case of
	no X11 include files found.

Tue Oct 17 13:21:38 1995  Bill Schelter  <wfs@jany.ma.utexas.edu>

	* Many changes to gcl 2.1 to support 64 bit machines (eg Dec
	alpha).  Layout of structures etc changed.
	* a gcl-2.2 beta was released in the summer.
	since then there have been several bugs fixed.  One in cmpfun.lsp
	affecting write, and another in init_gcl.lsp to make sure the
	link array is a string array (changed from fixnum which are no
	longer sufficient to hold pointers).
	* changes to fix for PA risc hpux in the hp800.h
	* changes to unexec-19.27.c to allow MUCH faster saving in NFS
	environment.
	* testing with maxima 5.1

	* various fixes to array.c for bitarrays and non 1 dimensional arrays
	* fix to Ieval

Sat Apr  1 14:01:35 1995  Bill Schelter  <wfs@jany.ma.utexas.edu>

	* There have been an infinite number of changes for gcl-2.0

	* GCL now contains a tcl/tk windowing interface.
	 It is based on TCL 7.3 and TK 3.6 available from
	 ftp.cs.berkeley.edu and many mirrors.

	 See the gcl-tk/demos/widget.lisp file for the demos.
	 

	* support for gzipped files
	(setq si::*allow-gzipped-file* t)
	to allow it.   (load "foo.o") will look for "foo.o.gz" if
	it does not find foo.o.   Writing gzipped files is not
	supported.

	* Command line args:
	See the documentaion in the info directory under command line.
	`-eval' `-load' etc.
	
	`-f'   allows shell scripts to be made such as
	==================
	#!/usr/local/bin/gcl.exe -f
	(print "hello world")
	==================

	* All documentation converted to texinfo, info format and
	extended.   Ansi common lisp documentation converted to texinfo

	* interrupts completely changed, to be more robust and to
	allow communication with tk.
