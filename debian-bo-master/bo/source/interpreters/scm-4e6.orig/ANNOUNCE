This message announces the availability of Scheme release scm4e6.

New in scm4e6 are:

	* bench.scm (benchmark): added.  computes and display statistics
	on "pi.scm" benchmark.
	* Makefile (benchlit bench): targets added.  Append stats to file
	"BenchLog".
	* scm.texi (Socket): added examples of chat servers and clients.
	(Internet Addresses and Socket Names): enlarged from "Internet
	Addresses".
	* socket.c (l_connect): BUF0 was missing from mode bits set in
	returned port.
	* build.scm (build-params): Added compiler-options and
	linker-options; added --batch-dialect and --script-name as aliases
	for -h and -w.
	* scmfig.h (HAVE_SELECT): Now defined for linux.
	* sys.c (igc): fixed off-by-1 error for sizeof save_regs_gc_mark.
	(gc_mark): fixed off-by-1 error for sizeof(CONTINUATION).  These
	seem to fix a very obscure GC bug.
	* Init.scm (exec-self): Added.
	* repl.c (init_repl): DUMP sets RESTART to EXEC-SELF.
	* repl.c (tryload): Made tail-recursive so that dump, quit, exit,
 	etc. will work as the last expression in a loading file.
	(scm_execpath): Split out from scm_unexec.
	* unexec.c: All Updated from emacs-19.34 -- no changes necessary.
	* gmalloc.c: 
	* pre-crt0.c:
	* ecrt0.c:
	* unexelf.c: fixes Linux (ELF) dump bug.
	* build.scm (platform): linux renamed linux-aout.  linux-elf fixed
 	and renamed linux.
	(C-libraries): X11R6 moved library files on RedHat Linux.  Linux
 	graphics library now has entry (doesn't default).
	(compile-dll-c-files linux):
	(make-dll-archive linux): Now converts from ".o" objects to ELF
	".so" form and "links" the usual libraries.
	* Link.scm (usr:lib x:lib): dynamic linking fixed for (linux ELF)
	dlopen.  Libraries other than ".so" object not needed; eliminated
	by usr:lib and x:lib returning #f.
	* dynl.c (l_dyn_unlink): prints result of dlerror() on errors.
	* eval.c (nconc2last): If CAUTIOUS is defined, checks that
	APPLY's arglist and last element of arglist are LIST?s.
	* sys.c (igc): symhash GC can now be disabled with
	#define NO_SYM_GC.
	* Init.scm (boot-tail): Added FSF --help and --version options.
	Added --no-init-file as a synonym for -no-init-file.
	* scm.texi (File-System Habitat): improved wording and added
	examples.
	* scm.texi (Top): Renamed sections.
	* sys.c (mark_syms mark_sym_values): Split up mark_symhash() to
	immunize against accidental pointers.
	* repl.c (gc_ports_collected): added to instrument symbol GC.
	* scm.texi (Debugging Scheme Code): Added section.
	* eval.c (definedp): Changed from a memoizing macro to a `syntax'.

 From maximum entropy <entropy@zippy.bernstein.com>:

	* ioext.c, scmfig.h: support for SGI (tested with SGI IRIX 5.2/gcc)
	* ioext.c (file_set_position): If a port is bidirectional
	(e.g. a socket) it may be necessary on some systems to perform a
	file positioning operation when switching between reading and
	writing.  This is required by ANSI C (ISO/IEC 9899:1990
	7.9.5.3).  Therefore, a	file-set-position on a bidirectional
	port should not signal an error if fseek generates an
	ESPIPE -- the fseek operation actually "succeeded" in that it
	reset the I/O direction flag for the FILE.
	* repl.c (input_waiting): R4RS requires that "char-ready?"
	return "#t" at end-of-file.  The semantics for "ioctl(...,
	FIONREAD, ...)" are such that it gives 0 on a socket that is
	closed (on the other side of the connection).  If the
	system has select(), use that instead to get the correct
	behavior. 
	* socket.c (l_listen): Treat sockets that have been "listened"
	as input-ports.  This allows polling for new connections
	(e.g. with "char-ready?") instead of blocking in
	"socket:accept". 
	* socket.c (l_accept): Fix type checking to agree with
	previous patch.

 From Radey Shouman  <shouman@zianet.com>

	* eval.c (unmemocar): The code in unmemocar to deal with ILOCs was
        never being executed.
	* sys.c (intern): fixed (new) symhash GC bug.
	* sys.c (igc): Added calls to mark_symhash() and sweep_symhash().
	These GC unused symbols with a top-level value of UNDEFINED.
	(mark_symhash): added.
	(sweep_symhash): added.

 From Eric Hanchrow  <erich@MICROSOFT.com>

	* scm.c (l_sleep): Ported to Windows NT (_WIN32)
	* ioext.c: Ported to Windows NT (_WIN32)
