This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk4.0p3 (John Ousterhout's production
release).  This version (Tk-b10) requires perl5.002.

Major changes are additional documentation, cleanups to composite 
widgets and error handling. This is likely to be the last "beta".

See INSTALL for how to build it.

For a very reasonable fee. We have rights to distribute them.

See Changes for what is different.

Note that :
 - the Tix stuff only has C code ported, the tcl parts still need
   converting to perl.
 - there are probably still partially completed things like HTML
   and NNTP reader ptknews lying about, which need other modules and/or more
   work.

There is a USNET newsgroup comp.lang.perl.tk for discussing all 
aspects of perl/Tk.

Unfortunately Nick does not get much chance to read the newsgroup,
and there are significant lags in propoagating news articles, 
so there is also a mailing list. Mail sent to the mailing list 
(eventually) shows up on the news groups so 'lurking' on the 
newsgroup is fine to see everything.

If you are really keen or want to help you may wish to subscribe to the
mailing list.

To do so send mail to majordomo@guest.wpi.edu with 'subscribe ptk'
in the body of the message.

e.g. on normal UNIX machine:

echo 'subscribe ptk' | mail majordomo@guest.wpi.edu

Please don't send subscribe requests to the list itself.

Sending problems to ptk@guest.wpi.edu is the best way 
to get answers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
pTk sub-directory is a modified version of Tk4.0p3

It has been modified to call "glue" functions rather than use libtcl.a - so it
is completely independant of TCL.

A goal is to have pTk directory and its library usable from 
perl/Tcl/LISP/c++/python etc.  - perl is 1st.

There are still serious snags with the others.
