The user visible changes in Tk-b9 / Tk-b9.01 / Tk-b10.

Most of user-level changes occurred in Tk-b9, Tk-b10 is mainly 
internal cleanup and documentation improvements and changes to Makefile.PL's
to suit perl5.002.

Tk-b10 has changed to $Tk::VERSION rather than $Tk:Version to be consistent
with other packages.

Tk-b10 has renamed Tk::BackgroundError to just Tk::Error - this makes
it more like Tcl/Tk and will allow C API's  BackgroundError to be exported
to perl one day.

The major change in Tk-b10 is that the doc subdirectory now contains 
'man' and HTML docs which are in terms of perl/Tk syntax rather than Tcl/Tk.
Some of the *.pod files have been incorporated there too.
The install process for docs is still not sorted though.

Error trapping has been "improved". There may be cases where it is 
now too strong.

Tk::Widget::after is now a wrapper on core Tk 'after' and auto-cancels
when widget is destroyed. OnDestroy method is also available for general 
use.

Added alias handling to derived widgets ConfigSpecs().

Changes for (a little) more detail.

Remaining changes are common to Tk-b9* ...

* Most if not all 'sub commands' now have an alias 
  e.g. 
   $w->option('add',...) 
  can now be written 
   $w->optionAdd(...) 
  Please let me know if I have missed any. 
  Medium term goal is to make second form 
  call straight into associated C code.

* A few method names have been changed to be more consistent.
  A script b9names is provided which should translate -b8 
  applications to -b9 names.

* The short hand constructors e.g. $w->Button(...)
  are now delegated to nominee widget of a composite.
  This makes it easier to create widgets with Text as 
  a parent inside a ScrlText. To create new widgets 
  as children of the composite 'frame' you need to use
  new directly:

  Tk::Button->new($cw,...);

* The Inherit mechanism is replaced with 5.002's SUPER::

* There is a Table widget - my own not BLT port.

* Various binding enhancements and two new flavours of Text:
  a read-only one, and one which allows edits to be undone.
