>>>> IMPORTANT <<<< : Install Locations 

5.002 has changed the default install location for non-core modules
like Tk. They are now normally installed in 'site lib'.

Now site_lib is searched _after_ the main perl5 directory is searched.
So if you have an earlier version of Tk installed in the main perl5 
directory (as was the default for earlier perls) then the _old_ one
will be found first.
There are really two approaches to this problem:

1. You can choose to install in main perl5 library as before
   This is what I do but this is because I have lots of perl versions
   on-line at once and the share a 'site' but need to find 'right' Tk.
   There are two ways to use this approach:

   A. You can change default at Makefile.PL time as in :

      perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=perl

   B. Or you can use a different make target (as below) - note that 
      forgetting to do so after applying a fix can lead to confusion...

   As I tend to forget this myConfig actually checks for 'me' and forces
   the issue!

2. You can remove the old version of Tk from the main perl directory.
   If you have earlier Tk source directory about
   you may be able to say : 

   cd .../Tk-b#
   make uninstall

   However that may not work very well as Makefile may notice a 
   newer perl and re-make Makefile (which may not work, and will 
   change default to site which is not what we want to uninstall!)
   It probably only works if you do it _before_ upgrading your perl.

   I have supplied a script 'uninstall' which attempts to cleanup 
   by removing all things starting with 'Tk' in nominated directories:

   perl uninstall [-perl] [-site] [-man] > script
   # read script !
   # If you have your own Tk-ish things you don't want deleted 
   # edit script as you see fit.
   sh script 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have decided that ...


Unpack the tar file *outside* the perl source tree for preference.

See Relnotes for what has changed at user-level and Changes for 
the things I remember having changed to get to this version.

To install this package you need perl5.002

Best place to get perl5.002 is via 'CPAN' site nearest you - the CPAN
sitelist at time of writing is appended.

ftp any-CPAN-site - see below:
cd CPAN/src/5.0
bin
get perl5.002.tar.gz

See README.osname for further hints/warnings

If you have perl5.002 installed in the normal way you proceed to build Tk.

It is much simpler to install perl than to try and use an uninstalled
private copy. If you have a private copy you should 'Configure' it to 
'install' somewhere you have write access to, and install it there,
then use that perl to build Tk.

When you have an up-to-date perl5.002 installed:

cd to the directory distribution unpacks to.

perl Makefile.PL
make 
make test 

If Makefile.PL reports that it cannot find X, or chooses a version
you don't like you can specify a version on the command line:

perl Makefile.PL X11=/usr/local/X11R5  

If X's include and lib are not under a common parent they can be specified
separately:

perl Makefile.PL X11INC=/usr/local/share/X11R5/include X11LIB=/usr/local/arch/X11R5/lib  

'make test' is a little tedious as it re-checks all the dependancies.

perl -Mblib demos/widget

Does more-or-less the same thing.
You can also run the less polished 'demos' in the top level directory 
the same way e.g.:

perl -Mblib basic_demo 

The 'blib.pm' file which makes above possible is will be installed
when you install Tk - if you don't like this remove blib.pm 
and blib/lib/blib.pm
re-run perl Makefile.PM and re-make (won't take as long this time).
before installing Tk.

You should now install using one of
the make targets:

make install       # normally site unless overridden as above

make INSTALLDIRS=perl  # Force perl 

make INSTALLDIRS=site  # Force site

Above call these targets (which may not survive MakeMaker changes):

make install_site  # Force site
make install_perl  # Force perl 

Once installed the demos in the demos sub-directory should run
(if #! line is right):

./demos/widget

---------------------------------------------------------

For static linking the following is how it is supposed to work 
(I think, but I don't use static linking normally, this scheme 
 worked as far as this on one trial under SunOS4.)

perl Makefile.PL
make 
make tkperl 
make test   # should work

This builds a perl with Tk statically linked in the Tk directory
thus:

./tkperl -Mblib demos/widget
./tkperl -Mblib basic_demo 

should now work.

'make install' subject to discussion above is then done.
I don't want to try it on my system incase is breaks the dynamic version,
and it gets harder and harder to keep track of all the options.

You may also have to do : 

make -f Makefile.aperl 

And you will have to change #! line in demo scripts to .../bin/tkperl

The master CPAN site is at ftp://ftp.funet.fi/
(Finland, Europe). Sselect the site nearest to you from the list
below to get the best response time and bandwidth.

The list of the registered CPAN sites follows.
Please note that the sorting order is alphabetical on fields:


	continent - country/state - ftp-url


and thus the North American servers happen to be listed last (for the
moment, anyway, no Oceanian or South American sites volunteered, yet).

How You Can Help

Inform

If you know of some Perl resources that seem not to be in the CPAN
(you did check the contents listings in indices/, didn't you?) please tell us.  We will grab it (if it is small and/or stable) or set up regular mirroring
(if it is not).

Contribute

If you have some modules/scripts/documentation yourself that you
would like to contribute to CPAN, please read the file authors/00upload.howto
and let us know.

Register

If you have a reliable and well-connected ftp site where you can
keep CPAN (about 170 MB currently), more mirror sites are welcome.
Feel free to volunteer and contact the CPAN
administrators describing your mirroring setup, please see the top
of the file MIRRORED.BY Of course, first
check (see from the above list) whether you
area (network-connectivity-and-bandwidth-wise) is already well
covered. Redundancy and fault-tolerance are good things for ftp
archives like CPAN but virtues can be exaggerated. Mirroring
software is available
from the CPAN itself.

Private/Local Mirroring

If you want to set up a private/local mirror of CPAN but
do not want to advertise it you do not need to contact the CPAN
admistrators. You need to assess which of the public CPAN
sites would give the best ftp bandwidth for you (during the
nighttime, mind) and then contact the email address dst_contact
given in the MIRRORED.BY file to learn the best time of the
day to do your mirror. Mirroring software
is available from the
CPAN itself.
