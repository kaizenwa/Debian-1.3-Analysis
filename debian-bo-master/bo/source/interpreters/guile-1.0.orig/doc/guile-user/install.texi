The latest guile snapshot, guile-r0, can be obtained by anonymous ftp
from @url{ftp://nis-ftp.lanl.gov/pub/users/rosalia/}

As I write this (May 1996), the current version is
@code{guile-r0.3.tar.gz}.

@c [???  make sure this is done right when the dust settles]

You can unbundle and compile it with
@cindex compiling Guile

@cartouche
@smallexample
gzcat guile-r0.3.tar.gz | tar xvf -
./configure --prefix=@var{your-prefix-path}
make
make install
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

When you configure you might want to enable internationalization
features, or threads, which you can do with
@cindex internationalization - enabling
@cindex i18n - enabling
@cindex threads - enabling
@cindex multithreads - enabling

@cartouche
@smallexample
./configure --prefix=@var{your-prefix-path} --enable-i18n --with-threads
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

You can read the @file{INSTALL} document if any of these steps fail, or
if you are curious.  You should also check out @ref{Bug reports and
hackarounds for various Guile releases} to know some of the problem
reports on Guile.

Once you have installed Guile, you will have some binaries, C libraries,
scheme libraries, Tcl/Tk libraries in your directory tree.  What should
you do now?
