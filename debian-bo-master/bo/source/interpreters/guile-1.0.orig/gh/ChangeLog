Fri Dec 20 21:03:34 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@papageno.lanl.gov>

	* gh_eval.c (gh_eval_str_with_catch): 
	* gh_eval.c (gh_eval_str_with_standard_handler): 
	* gh_init.c (gh_standard_handler): implemented eval_str with error
	handling.

Tue Dec 17 08:28:29 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh_init.c (gh_catch): added catch mechanism, but still unclear
	on how it should be used in the gh_ interface.

	* *: added copyright notice to all source files.

Tue Dec  3 19:06:27 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (check_PROGRAMS): Renamed from bin_PROGRAMS.

Mon Dec  2 22:06:14 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* gh.c: about to split into several smaller files.

	* gh.c: added more type predicates, and equality predicates too.

Sat Nov 30 23:48:55 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* PLUGIN/Makefile.am, PLUGIN/Makefile.in: Removed.
	* PLUGIN/greet: Removed.
	* Makefile.am, aclocal.m4: New files.
	* configure.in: Updated for Automake.

Tue Nov 19 12:46:16 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh.c (gh_new_procedure5_0): added higher order new_procedure
	functions as a convenience for Gnudl.
	(gh_enter_repl): added a new style of gh_enter(), which is when
	you don't want to manage the program directly, but rather you want
	to call your own initialization stuff and then have Guile do the
	REPL.  The REPL used is in Scheme, and is probably part of
	boot-9.scm.  This needs to be examined.  The other issue to be
	examined is that of allowing several initialization functions
	rather than just one.  It should probably be done with a
	"register" mechanism.
	(gh_scm2int): added this routine.  It has loss of precision, but
	so does any conversion from a bignum to a C integer.

Sat Nov 16 17:50:54 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh.c (gh_scm2str0): continued work on this; made obj *not* be an
	SCM * type.

Fri Nov 15 16:32:35 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh.h (gh_list): defined gh_list as a macro.

Thu Nov 14 13:53:30 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh.c (gh_procedure_p): implemented some simple predicates; they
	return 0 or 1 C booleans.
	(gh_new_procedure): now I return the SCM value representing the
	procedure.

	* gh_test.c (main_prog): added cute tests for gh_*_p(); seems to
	work.

	* gh.c (gh_scm2bool): name change: C ints will be considered
	bools in the nomenclature, rather than SCM objects being
	considered bools.

Tue Oct 22 20:40:25 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Use the new scm_boot_guile calling discipline.
	* gh.c (gh_enter): Call scm_boot_guile with new, simplified
 	arguments; move all the real guts to gh_launch_pad, since only
 	there can we safely work with Scheme objects.
	(gh_launch_pad): New function.
	(main_prog_t): New typedef, for clarity.
	(scm_boot_guile_1): Declaration deleted.
	(dummy_init_func): Deleted.

	* gh.c (gh_eval_str): New definition for this, copied from
 	guile.c.
	(gscm_portprint_obj, gscm_strprint_obj, gscm_silent_repl,
	_eval_port, seval_str, gscm_seval_str): Deleted.
	
Mon Oct 21 14:49:29 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh_test.c (main_prog): changed gh_test.c to work with the new
	approach to running Guile.

	* gh.c (gh_enter): changed name from gh_startup to gh_enter.
	gh_enter now passes a stack base to scm_boot_guile_1().

Sun Oct 20 10:27:11 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* gh.c (gh_startup): changed it to take a function point as
	argument, as well as argc, argv: this way I can implement the
	conservative garbage collector.

Sat Oct 19 16:28:04 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* gh.c (gh_scm2str): Bugfix: SCM_MAKICHR -> SCM_ICHR.
	(gh_define): Disabled to make gh.c compile.

Thu Oct 17 19:29:34 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* gh.c (gh_car): added all the car/cdr/caar/... up to depth of 3
	and then got nauseated.

Wed Oct 16 07:28:01 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh.c: changed from prefix lgh_ to prefix gh_.

Tue Oct 15 17:05:29 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* gh.c (lgh_eval_file): scm_sys_try_load has been renamed to
	scm_primitive_load; adjust the use here.

Tue Oct 15 14:56:40 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* configure.in: added AC_CHEC_LIB(socket, main) so it will find
	sockets on solaris.

Sat Oct  5 18:55:35 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* gh.c: Renamed last_debug_info_frame --> scm_last_debug_frame

Fri Sep 20 17:11:20 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.am (dist-dir): Use the directory name passed down from
	the parent in the DISTDIR variable; the nightly snapshot process
	sets this to something other than guile-VERSION, so we can't
	assume that here.

Sat Sep 14 08:47:10 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* PLUGIN/REQ: try to make dependencies work right.

	* PLUGIN/guile.config (xtra_dependencies): add only libgh.a.
	(xtra_cflags): just add -L../lgh

	* PLUGIN/guile.libs: try -lgh -lguile

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): add -I../ so that libguile/scmconfig.h can
	be found when srcdir != build dir.

Fri Sep 13 14:00:10 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.am (distdir): ugly hackaround to allow the inclusion of
	lgh in the snapshots.

Thu Sep 12 17:19:39 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* gh.c,lgh_test.c: the library now builds, but I must now connect
 	it to the latest libguile routines for type conversion, or
	lgh_test will not compile properly.

	* lgh_test.c: now it at least compiles; I'm not yet sure that it
 	works yet.  I'm checking it in so we have a tree that builds.
