Wed Dec 18 10:00:49 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* guile.c (guile_main): Don't rely on string catenation in the
	compiler.

Tue Dec 17 15:26:46 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* guile.c (guile_main): Document -s.  Print --version and --help
	output to stdout, per GNU standards.
	(usage): Document -s.

Sat Nov 30 23:50:47 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* PLUGIN/greet: Removed.
	* Makefile.am, aclocal.m4: New files.
	* configure.in: Updated for Automake.

Sat Nov  2 19:51:08 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* guile.c: Added #include <stdlib.h>, #include <sys/types.h> and
 	#include <sys/stat.h>;
	Added options -e and --emacs to activate Guile's Emacs support;
	Bugfix: use braces around the *two* statements at
	`if (optchar == 's')';
	Load "init.scm" after "boot-9.scm" if present (looked up in the
	load-path *before* loading "boot-9.scm";
	If running with repl, load user's init file "$HOME/.guile" if
	present.

Mon Oct 28 19:29:13 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* guile.c (guile_eval_str): Moved to libguile/strports.c.
	(guile_main): Call scm_eval_0str, not guile_eval_str.

Fri Oct 25 02:30:51 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* guile.c (guile_main): Since we'd like to eventually be
 	compatible with SCSH, process arguments in order, and accept a
 	`-s' option which terminates argument processing and specifies the
 	name of the script to run.  Without the -s, run interactively, as
 	normal.

	* guile.c: Make Guile usable as a #! interpreter.
	#include <string.h>.
	(main): Move guts of argument processing from here...
	(guile_main): Into here, after initializing plugins.  Run the
 	boot_cmd.  Then, if we were given arguments, treat the first one
 	as the name of a script to load, and the remainder as arguments to
 	that script.  Otherwise, be interactive.  Change call to
 	scm_set_program_arguments to set first argument correctly.

	* guile.c (guile_main): Set program_name nicely.

	* guile.c (guile_eval_str): Rename declaration from eval_0str.

Fri Oct 25 01:05:06 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* guile.c (initplugs): Renamed from scm_appinit.
	(guile_main): Call it, to initialize all plugins.  Oops.

Tue Oct 22 20:49:42 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Use the new scm_boot_guile calling discipline.
	* guile.c (main): Call scm_boot_guile with new, simplified
 	argument list; pass address of guile_main as function to call.
	Since scm_boot_guile doesn't return any more, we can chuck a bunch
	of code.
	(guile_main): New function; evaluate the boot command, and start
 	the repl.
	(guile_eval_str): New function, adapted from old code in
 	libguile/init.c

Tue Oct 15 17:10:23 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (BOOT_CMD_DEF): Call primitive-load-path, not
	%try-load-path; it's been renamed.

Fri Oct 11 02:08:25 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* guile.c (main): Update version message to mention the GPL.

Mon Oct  7 16:21:08 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* guile.c (main): Include a newline at the end of the `--version'
	message, and mention the lack of warranty.

Wed Oct  2 23:49:10 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* .gdbinit: New file.

Tue Oct  1 01:51:27 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Added thread configuration magic.

Tue Sep 10 13:53:58 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* guile.c (main): Add more text to the --version message, as per
	new GNU coding standards requirements.

	* guile.c (main): Clarify logic for exiting when we're given the
	--version or --help options.

Thu Sep  5 23:39:55 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* configure.in: read guile.config outside of a subshell (when
	$srcdir != .)

Thu Sep  5 11:30:47 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Since we have C code for setting and searching the
	load path, the boot command no longer need specify the absolute
	path of the script.
	(datadir, pkgdatadir, pkgverdatadir, bootfile): Variables deleted.
	(BOOT_CMD_DEF): Just give the tail of the Scheme file to load, not
	an absolute path name.

Thu Sep  5 02:04:42 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@woody.nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.in (.c.o): Added -I$(srcdir)/.. to .c.o rule (otherwise
	the include files won't be found if object code and source is kept
	separately).

	* guile.c: Added anchors for GDB interface.

Wed Sep  4 00:50:52 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (.c.o): Doc fix.
	(install): Make a symlink called "guile" to the executable, called
	guile$(VERSION).
	(uninstall): Remove the symlink.

	* configure.in: Don't run the guile.config files twice when srcdir
	is ".".  It duplicates compilation flags, making the commands hard
	to read.

Fri Aug 30 15:43:03 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (datadir, pkgdatadir, pkgverdatadir, bootfile): New
	variables.
	(BOOT_CMD_DEF): Use them to construct the value.  It's more
	readable.

	* Makefile.in (bindir): Let autoconf provide the value, rather
	than deriving it ourselves.

Thu Aug 29 23:06:49 1996  Thomas Morgan  <tmorgan@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (BOOT_CMD_DEF): Use datadir rather than libdir.

Thu Aug 29 21:59:42 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Changes from Thomas Morgan: Add --help and --version options.
	* getopt.c, getopt.h, getopt1.c: New files.
	* Makefile.in (objs, c_files, distfiles): Add the getopt files as
	appropriate.
	* configure.in: Substitute GUILE_VERSION into the Makefile.
	* guile.c: #include "getopt.h".
	(program_name, usage, long_opts): New variables, for option
	processing.
	(main): Add new option processing code.  Support the --version and
	--help options.

	* guile.c (main): Add bug report address to --help message.

Fri Aug 23 02:08:11 1996  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* configure: regenerate using autoconf.

	* configure.in: check for guile.config in the build directory as
	well as in the source directory.  The gtcltk-lib guile.config
	is generated in the build directory.

Thu Aug 15 01:45:06 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Reworked system for omitting subdirectories; see comments in
	top-level ChangeLog.
	* configure.in: Don't use wildcards to extract files from the
	PLUGIN directories; that doesn't allow us to exclude certain
	subdirectories.  Instead, use the list of subdirectories computed
	by the top-level configure script, ../config.build-subdirs.

	* guile.c (main): Pass scm_appinit to the first call to
 	scm_boot_guile as its new `initfunc' argument; libguile no longer
 	hardcodes the name scm_appinit.  Having magic identifier names for
 	the user to define is crufty.  Pass zero the second time; we don't
	want to do anything.

Wed Aug 14 19:58:16 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@sans09.nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.in: Added $(LIBS) to linking command.

	* configure.in: Added checks for libsocket.a and libnsl.a.

Thu Aug  1 02:51:10 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (dist-dir): New target.
	(distfiles): Remove PLUGIN; it needs special handling in the
	dist-dir target.
	(SUBDIR, manifest): Deleted.

Thu May  9 10:31:02 1996  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* guile.c (main): Use the native, not the Tcl init regiment.

Tue Jan 30 15:13:23 1996  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): standards.info

Sat Jul  1 02:26:59 1995  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* Pow!
