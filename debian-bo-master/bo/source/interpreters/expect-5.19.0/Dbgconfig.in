# This is for LynxOS, which needs a flag to force true POSIX when
# building. It's weirder than that, cause the flag varies depending
# how old the compiler is. So...
# -X is for the old "cc" and "gcc" (based on 1.42)
# -mposix is for the new gcc (at least 2.5.8)
# This modifies the value of $CC to have the POSIX flag added
# so it'll configure correctly
