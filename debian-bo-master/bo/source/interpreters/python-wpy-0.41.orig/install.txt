Unix Install
==========

You need a version of Python with tkintermodule.c and Tk 4.0
or later already set up.  A Linux binary is provided.  Then
unpack the wpycomon.tgz files.  You will have to edit the demo files'
"#! /usr/local/bin/python" if your python is located elsewhere.
Text files may have \r\n line ends from DOS.  These are harmless
and you may leave them or edit them out.

wpy.py, wpy_tk.py, wpycon.py, wpyinter.py
Install these on your PYTHONPATH.  These files implement the "wpy"
Python windowing package.  The file wpyinter.py is the Python interactive
Windows NT program and is not used for Unix.

demo??.py
These are the demos.  Install anywhere.

./doc/*
Documentation.  Install anywhere.


NT Install
==========

Install the following files:

wpy_nt.exe
This is the main program.  Install on your path.  When
invoked with no arguments, it runs "wpyinter.py".  Otherwise,
enter a file name to run.  You may want to set up a Windows
"Association" to connect "*.py" files to wpy_nt.exe.  Then
you can double-click on Python files to run them.

*.dll
Install all *.dll files on your path.  The Python core DLL is py13an.dll.

wpy.py, wpycon.py, wpyinter.py, wpy_tk.py
Install these on your PYTHONPATH.  These files implement the "wpy"
Python windowing package and the Python interactive window program.
The wpy_tk.py file is only used under Unix.

demo??.py
These are the demos.  Install anywhere.

./doc/*
Documentation.  Install anywhere.

*.cpp *.h wpython.rc wpython.mak
These are the source files and a VC++ 2.0 makefile.  Put these files
in a subdirectory (I use e:/users/jim/wpython) and edit the makefile
to point to the proper place.  You also need to compile the Python 1.3
source into a ".lib" file to link in.

You will also need the Microsoft Win32s dll if you don't have NT, and
the Microsoft MFC dll's distributed separately.

If you run under Win32s, check to be sure that you have a big swap
file set up and that you have lots of memory.
