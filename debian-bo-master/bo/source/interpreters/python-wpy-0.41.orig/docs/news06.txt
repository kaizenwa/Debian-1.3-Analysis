There is a new version of the "Wpy" GUI programming module 
available on ftp.interet.com in directory /pub/python.  The
version number is 0.23.

Recall that the point of all this is to have a native Python GUI language
such that programs written in it run with native look and feel on Windows
and Unix/X under Tk (and hopefully Mac and OS2) with no changes.

The code is now past the "proof of concept" stage, and I now consider
it to be "simple but useful".  The latest version runs equally well
on Windows and Unix/Tk.  I now feel that "Wpy" is ready for real public
use, at least for simple GUI design.  If any potential users feel
necessary features are missing, please complain and I will add them
in the order requested.

Changes are:

  Documentation (1200 lines).

  The Tk text widget in an "Edit View" (as in Windows).

  Drawing tools for text, rectangles, color.

  The list box control and a one-line edit (entry) control.

  File reading/writing.

  A Tk file dialog box (very nice, and so easy to do in Python).

  A new demo consisting of a simple text editor.

  Numerous new features and improvements.

Work is continuing to add more features.  I would be happy to receive
any feedback, especially from people writing code in Wpy.
