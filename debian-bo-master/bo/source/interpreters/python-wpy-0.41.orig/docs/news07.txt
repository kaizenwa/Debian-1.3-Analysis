There is a new version of the "Wpy" GUI programming module available on
ftp.interet.com in directory /pub/python.  The version number is 0.24.
This is mirrored on ftp.python.org as /pub/python/wpy and on cwi.nl as
/pub/python/wpy.

Recall that the point of all this is to have a native Python GUI language
such that programs written in it run with native look and feel on Windows
and Unix/X under Tk (and hopefully Mac and OS2) with no changes.

Work is continuing to add more features.  I would be happy to receive
any feedback, especially from people writing code in Wpy.

Changes are:

  Set the frame window size with frame.MoveWindowSize().
  A new wait cursor feature.  See cmdtarg.txt.
  More documentation.  See frame.txt etc.
  GetDeviceScrollPosition() for scrolled edit views.
  SetFocus() for windows. 
  The OnChar() message is sent to the edit control.  Useful for catching
    "Enter" to dismiss the control if it is not in a dialog box.
  Support for modeless dialogs.  See dialog.txt.
  DestroyWindow() for windows.  Useful to destroy a control.
  Numerous other small improvements.
