There is now a Python port for Windows 3.1 available on ftp.interet.com
/pub/python/w31_13a.zip.  This is mirrored at www.python.org and at cwi.nl.
This means that Python can run as a native Windows 3.1 app, and Win32s is
not required.  QuickWin is used to provide console support.

I also have a Windows 3.1 version of WPY as /pub/python/wpy31bin.exe.  This
means that WPY programs will now run as native apps on 16-bit Windows.
They will also run on OS/2 using Windows support.

This is a significant extension of WPY portability.
