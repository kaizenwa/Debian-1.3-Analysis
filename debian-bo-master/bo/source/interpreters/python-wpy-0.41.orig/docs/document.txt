class CDocument

Class CDocument represents a document, one of the most basic objects.  A
document is a unit of data which the user opens with the File Open
command and saves with the File Save command.

In an SDI application, the same document is reused each time the user
selects File New or File Open.  In an MDI app, a new document is created
each time.  So you must put initialization code into OnNewDocument or
OnOpenDocument and you must put de-initialization code into
OnCloseDocument.

Instance Variables

wpyParent
	For a document, the parent is the template which created
	the document.
wpyChildList
	For a document, the child list is a list of frames which
	belong to the document.
wpyViewList
	A list of all the views which show this document.

Methods you will probably override:

__init__(self, templ)
templ: The template being used to create the document.

DeleteContents(self)
	Called to delete the contents of a document.  It is called just
	before the document is destroyed.  In a SDI app, it is called to
	insure the document is empty so it can be reused.
	The default implementation does nothing and you should provide
	your own method.

SerializeIn(self, file_object)
	Sent when the user requests the document to be read from disk.
	The "file_object" is a file object open for reading.
	The default implementation does nothing and you should provide
	your own method.

SerializeOut(self, file_object)
	Sent when the user requests the document to be written to disk.
	The "file_object" is a file object open for writing.
	The default implementation does nothing and you should provide
	your own method.

Methods you will probably use as is:

SetModifiedFlag(self, value = 1)
	Call this method after you have modified the document.  This
	ensures that the user is prompted to save a modified document.
	To mark a document as clean, call with a value of zero.

SetTitle(self, title)
	Set the title of the document.  This determines the titles on all
	frames which show the document.  The default title is wpyText of
	the document template.

UpdateAllViews(self, sender, update)
sender, the view which is notifying the other views of a change, or None.
update, an arbitrary Python object passed to OnUpdate.
	Call this after you call SetModifiedFlag.  It informs all views
	other than the view specified by "sender" that the document has
	been modified and should be re-displayed.  It calls the view's
	OnUpdate method passing it "update".  Use "update" to pass
	information on how much of the document was changed.


Virtual methods you could override and/or call the base class:

int OnNewDocument(self)
	Called as part of the File New command.  The default implementation
	calls DeleteContents and marks the new document as clean.  You should
	call the base class method in your override.  A return of zero
	indicates failure, otherwise success.
	This method is not usually replaced.

int OnOpenDocument(self, filename)
	Called as part of the File Open command.  The default implementation
	calls DeleteContents, calls SerializeIn to read in the document,
	and marks the new document as clean.  You could override this
	method to provide a different file interface.

void OnCloseDocument(self)
	Called when the document is closed.  The default implementation
	calls DeleteContents, and then closes the frame windows for all
	the views attached to the document.  You can call the base class
	method in your override.

int OnSaveDocument(self, filename)
	Called as part of the File Save and File Save As command.  The
	default implementation opens the specified file, calls SerializeOut
	to write it, and marks the document as clean.  A return of zero
	indicates failure, otherwise success.
