There is a new Windows NT version of Python available on ftp.interet.com
in directory /pub/python.  It includes the latest version of my proposed
Python GUI language.

Since the last version which ran on Tk, I have changed the programming
model to document/view instead of window.  This broke the Tk version.
I hope to have a consistent Tk and NT version done by the time of the
workshop.  The Tk version will be based on Tk version 4.0 beta 3.
Note that this code is not the same as Mark Hammond's NT version.
Please get his too.

Recall that the point of all this is to have a native Python GUI language
such that programs written in it run with native look and feel on Windows,
Tk and hopefully Mac and OS2 with no changes.

The program has been tested on a 60 Mz pentium running NT, and on a 20 Mhz
386 with 5 Meg of memory using Win32s under Windows 3.1.  The pentium works
great.  The 386 has too little memory to run Win32s programs, but the
program will run provided a big enough swap file (I use 11 Megs) is specified.
Performance then is surprisingly good, although startup is slow and the mouse
drawing speed is slow.  Even simple tasks cause paging.  Also, there is a
startup message "winsock.dll not found" which can be ignored.  It is caused
by including the socket module.  I am very happy it works on a 386!

This version starts an interactive window if no file name is specified.
There is a new demo equal to the "Scribble" demo provided with VC++.  This
is a test of the speed of Python in a GUI.  It draws lines on a window
(sorry, I meant view) by capturing mouse move events, creating a class
instance and a pen, and making a list of points.  Code is a literal version
of the original C++, and is not very efficient in Python.  But it works
quite well.  I plan to rewrite it after I port it to Tk.  In general I am
very happy with the speed of Python, even when handling the troublesome
mouse move events.

I would appreciate any feedback you could give me.

Jim
