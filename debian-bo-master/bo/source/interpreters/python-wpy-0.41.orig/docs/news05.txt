There is a new combined Windows NT and Tk version of my proposed Python
GUI available on ftp.interet.com in directory /pub/python.

Recall that the point of all this is to have a native Python GUI language
such that programs written in it run with native look and feel on Windows
and Unix/X under Tk (and hopefully Mac and OS2) with no changes.

This is the first version which succeeds in doing that!

The Windows part was described in a previous message
(see /pub/python/news04.txt).  This release includes the Tk part
plus necessary changes to the Windows part.  It runs on a stock
Unix build of Python when linked with Tk 4.0 beta 3 (the new Tk).
If you don't have that Tk but have Linux, I posted a Linux binary.

The Tk part has been tested on a 60 Mhz Pentium running Linux and X11R6
with the twm window manager.  I would be happy to get test results from
other systems.  Be sure your tkinter uses Tk4.0b3, as Tk 3.6 will fail.

There is a new demo equal to the "Scribble" demo provided with VC++.  This
works on both Windows and Unix too.  The demo is small but non-trivial.

There are some known problems with the code, but I want to give everyone
a chance to see it before the workshop.  I will polish it after that.

I would appreciate any feedback you could give me.

Jim
