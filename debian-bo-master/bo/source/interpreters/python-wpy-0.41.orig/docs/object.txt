class CObject

Methods

BeginWaitCursor(self)
	Change the application's cursor to the hourglass cursor to indicate
	a possibly lengthly operation.

EndWaitCursor(self)
	Change the cursor back to normal.  The system will do this itself
	if the app becomes idle, so you may not need to call this method.
