There is a new version of the "WPY" GUI programming module available on
ftp.interet.com in directory /pub/python.  The version number is 0.34.
This is mirrored on ftp.python.org as /pub/python/wpy and on cwi.nl as
/pub/python/wpy.

Changes are:

New drawing methods for circles, ellipses, polygons, arcs,
  pie slices and chords.
New document method to set the title.  Fixed MDI frame titles.
For the Tk version: new look for MDI, fixed OnChar() method in CEditView,
  fixed ".." since 1.3 no longer includes it in os.listdir().
Added a way to set background and text color for a CEdit edit control.
Added DestroyDrawn() to destroy a drawn object.
Redraw() is now able to change an object's position.
Rudimentary printing support, one page only.
