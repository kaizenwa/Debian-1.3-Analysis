class CEditView
__init__(self, templ, doc, frame)

Class CEditView is a view which supports interactive editing of its
contents.  An edit view displays multiple lines of text.  The edit
view controls its own drawing, so there is no OnDraw() message. An
edit view supports an insertion cursor and a selection.

Text is referenced by line number and by character number, both of which
start at zero.  The first character is line 0 character 0.  The insertion
cursor is at the character position following the cursor.  The selection
is from the first selected character to one past the last character.
For example, if line 123 is "012345678", and the insertion cursor is
between the "4" and "5", the position of the cursor is (123, 5).  If
"23456" is selected, the selection is (123, 2, 123, 7).
