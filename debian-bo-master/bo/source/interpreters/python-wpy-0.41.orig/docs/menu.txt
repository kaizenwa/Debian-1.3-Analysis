class WpyMenuItem(CMenu)
	An abstract class with methods inherited by the menu buttons.

Methods

Destroy(self)
	Destroy a menu button.
	You must call frame.DrawMenuBar() if you change a menu.
Insert(self, index=999)
	Insert the menu button in its parent at "index".  Index
	is 0, 1, ..., and an index past the end means to append
	the menu item.
	You must call frame.DrawMenuBar() if you change a menu.

self.TrackPopup(win) needs a frame as win.

The name of a popup is NULL, so the handler name of
item "Item" is "OnMenuItem".

Menu items on a menu bar may be positioned on the right
side by setting the attribute item.wpyRightSide = 1.  This
is ineffective on Windows.
