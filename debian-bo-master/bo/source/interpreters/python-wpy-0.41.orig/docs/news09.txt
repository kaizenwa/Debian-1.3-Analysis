There is a new version of the "WPY" GUI programming module available on
ftp.interet.com in directory /pub/python.  The version number is 0.32.
This is mirrored on ftp.python.org as /pub/python/wpy and on cwi.nl as
/pub/python/wpy.

This release supports bitmap images.  It also has more standard dialogs.
See changes.txt.

Both versions (Tk and Windows) support GIF and PPM bitmap formats.  This
enables either format to run on WPY with no changes, thus contributing
to portability.  The Windows version also supports BMP and DIB.

There was a Windows socket problem with the previous version of wpy.  When
I put up a fix, the new binary was incompatible with the old wpy.py, so
I had a phase error.  The new release fixes all that.
