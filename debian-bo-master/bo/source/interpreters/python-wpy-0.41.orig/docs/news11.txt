There is a major new release of the "WPY" GUI programming module available
on ftp.interet.com in directory /pub/python.  The version number is 0.40.
This is mirrored at ftp.python.org and at cwi.nl.  Users of WPY will
probably want to get all new files.

This release is finally at Python 1.3, and uses Python as a DLL.
Eventually I will use Mark Hammond's DLL instead of my own.

It also fixes all known problems with the Win32s version used by
Windows 3.1.  Dialog backgrounds and 3-d controls now work.

Other changes are:

The class method OnChar() now exits the app under Windows when
  the user types Control-break (use Control-C on Tk).
New global functions SetTimer(), KillTimer() implement time delays.
New multi-line edit control with optional scroll bars: CMultiEdit.
New menu methods Destroy() and Insert() to change menu items.
Can now use tabs within list box item lines.
Fixed a problem with setting a font in a window.
