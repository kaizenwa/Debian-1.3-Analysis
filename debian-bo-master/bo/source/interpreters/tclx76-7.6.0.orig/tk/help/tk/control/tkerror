NAME
       tkerror - Command invoked to process background errors

SYNOPSIS
       tkerror message


DESCRIPTION
       Note: as of Tk 4.1 the tkerror command has been renamed to
       bgerror because the event  loop  (which  is  what  usually
       invokes  it) is now part of Tcl.  The changes are backward
       compatible, so that old uses of tkerror should still work,
       but  you should modify your scripts to use bgerror instead
       of tkerror.  Documentation for  bgerror  is  available  as
       part of Tcl's documentation.
