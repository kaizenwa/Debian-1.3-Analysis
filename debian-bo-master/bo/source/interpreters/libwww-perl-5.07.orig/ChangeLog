    future.  It includes the new WWW::RobotRules::AnyDBM_File class
    and updates to LWP::RobotUA.

 o  HTML::Parser now supports buggy Netscape comment parsing.  Enable
    it by calling $p->netscape_buggy_comment(1).  The previous version
    of the parser could also (under very unlucky and unlikely
    circumstances) call the $self->comment() method several times for
    the same comment text.

 o  HTML::Parser: Use new $p->eof to signal end of document instead of
    $p->parse(undef).

 o  HTML::Element::starttag() is now smarter about which quotes it

 o  URI::URL:  New method ($url->rel) which does the opposite of abs().
    Example: url("http://host/a/b/c", "http://host/c/d/e")->rel would
    return url("../../a/b/c", "http://host/c/d/e").  This was
    suggested by Nicolai Langfeldt <janl@ifi.uio.no>

 o  Made $header->authorization_basic return "uname:passwd" in scalar
    context

 o  LWP::Protocol::collect() will let the HTML::HeadParser look at the
    document content as it arrives.  This will initialize headers from
    elements like <base href="...">, <title>...</title> and <meta
    http-equiv="..." ...>.

 o  Simplified $response->base implementation, because we don't have
    to look into the content any more.

    at places where we <> or print.

 o  Always localize $_ before any 'while(<FILE>) {}'-loops

 o  Implemented $protocol->collect_once() and simplified several
    of the protocol implementations by using it.

 o  The HTML parser used to get it wrong if you were unlucky about the
    breakup of the text. An example of broken behaviour was this:

 o  LWP::Socket::_getaddress() Numerical IP adresses did not work.

 o  LWP::Socket::pushback() did not work.  This also avoids the bad
    pp_select() core dump from perl.

 o  Allow request content to be provided by a callback routine.

 o  Fix bug that prevented response callback to work.  The first parameter
    (data) is no longer a reference, because $_[0] is already a reference.
    Don't callback unless successful response.  Callbacks during redirects
    was confusing.

 o  URI::URL.  Remove port from netloc if it is the default port.
    Don't use anything, just require.

 o  HTTP::Message->addContent() does not need a reference parameter.

 o  LWP::Socket->open() has been renamed top LWP::Socket->connect()
    LWP::Socket->close has gone.  Implemented new method LWP::Socket->read()

       LWP::MIMEheader --> HTTP::Headers
       LWP::StatusCode --> HTTP::Status
       LWP::Message    --> HTTP::Message
       LWP::Request    --> HTTP::Request
       LWP::Response   --> HTTP::Response
       LWP::MIMEtypes  --> LWP::MediaTypes

       - Update the @header_order according to the August 3rd draft.
       - Added Response Header fields: 'Location', 'Public', 'Retry-After',
         'Server', and 'WWW-Authenticate'.
       - Moved 'unknown header' handling from &scan to &header. The old
         implementation was forcing all unknown header-words to begin with
	 an uppercase (as it should be), but disallowed other uppercase
	 letters.
       - updates the status code messages under the August
         3rd HTTP/1.0 draft.  '203' became 'Non-Authoritative Information',
	 '303' became 'See Other', and a new code,
	 '411 Authorization Refused', was added.

 o  Can remove multiple headers with single removeHeader() call in MIMEheader.

 o  Can assign multiple field/value pairs in header() method of MIMEheader.

 o  A field with multiple values is printed as separate values in
    MIMEheader::as_string().

 o  LWP::Response contain new attributes: previous() and request().  These
    attributes are updated by the UserAgent.

 o  Appended \n to some die statements in Socket so that line numbers are
    suppressed in error messages.

 o  Made UserAgent::clone work for reference members

 o  Check for redirect loops and multiple authorization failures by
    examination of the response chain.

 o  Use "\015\012" instead of "\r\n" in protocol modules.  Some systems
    define \r and \n differently.

 o  request program can now handle documents that needs autorization by
    prompting the user for username/password. Added new -S option to print
    request/response chain.

Fri Jul 14 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Reorganized directories.  Moved LWP.pm up.  Moved file.pm and http.pm
    into the LWP::Protocol direcotory.  Moved LWP out of the lib directory
    and removed lib.

 o  Implemented the "get" and "mirror" scripts in the "bin" directory.

 o  Implemented "install-lwp", "update_version" and "make-dist".  The library
    version number is found in the VERSION file.

 o  Always adds 1900 to the year in LWP::Date

 o  In LWP::MIMEheader:  Implemented clone(), removeHeader() and scan() 
    methods.  Reimplemented asString.  Removed asMIME().  Moved "Good
    Practice" into this file, and reimplemented it.

 o  Moved "header" and "content" into LWP::Message class.  This change made
    LWP::Request and LWP::Response much simpler.  Made clone() method
    actually work.

 o  LWP::Protocol::implementor does not die if it cannot load package.

 o  Moved UserAgent convenience methods into LWP::Simple.  Made LWP::Simple
    export LWP::StatusCode symbols and functions.

 o  Implemented $ua->isProtocolSupported($scheme) method.

 o  Nicer directory listing in LWP::Protocol::file.pm

 o  Rely on URI::URL 3.00 behaviour for $url->full_path

 o  Library version number now in LWP.pm.  You should be able to say
    "use LWP 1.0;" if you need at least this version.

 o  Various cleanups and arranging layout as I like it.  Use fooBar-style
    (as opposed to foo_bar stype) everywhere.  This means that as_string()
    now is called asString().

 o  Added more documentation.



Wed Jun 14 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Removed lot of rendundant & before function calls.

 o  $this --> $self

 o  &collector passes content as a reference, don't want to copy so much

 o  parameterlist to collect callback has been rearranged

 o  Response::addContent gets a reference to the data

 o  Added some callback documentation to UserAgent.pm

 o  Protocol::file now uses the collector

 o  Introduced LWP::Simple



Sun Jun 11 1995   Martijn Koster <m.koster@nexor.co.uk>

 o  Added basic authentication support

 o  Added mirroring of single documents

 o  Change Protocol construction from whacky URL.pm (constructor returns
    subclass) to more normal C++'ish way.



Wed June 7 1995   Martijn Koster <m.koster@nexor.co.uk>

 o  Separated socket stuff into separate module

 o  Added LWP::MemberMixin to reduce code duplication

 o  Cosmetic changes to LWP::Date

 o  Renamed LWP::Error to LWP::StatusCode

 o  Renamed LWP::MIME to LWP::MIMEtype

 o  Changed the tests to cope with all this

It's getting there...



Mon May 22 1995   Martijn Koster <m.koster@nexor.co.uk>

 o  Changed the socket reading to use sysread.  This will have to go
    into a module of its own.



Thu 18 May 1995   Martijn Koster <m.koster@nexor.co.uk>

 o  Mentioned on libwww-perl that I had changed the classes around lots.
