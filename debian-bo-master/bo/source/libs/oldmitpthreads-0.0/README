You should do

./configure

first to generate the "config.in."

Then you need to symbolic links for asm and linux in .../src/include
just like the ones in /usr/include.

make clean
make depend

"make depend" may generate warnings in

sysdeps/pthreads/linux/i386
sysdeps/pthreads/linux/m68k/Makefile
sysdeps/pthreads/linux/Makefile
sysdeps/pthreads/libio/Makefile

for sources via VPATH. You can ignore them

Then you can do

make			# compile all the ELF libraries.

make LITE=true		# for light version shared library. no libm.a.
			# no stub libraries are built.

Don't try to add SHADOW_COMPAT=whatever, since this support is not the
right way.  It WILL cause your passwords reappear in /etc/passwd, which
is clearly not the right way.  Shadow passwords are supported correctly
without this option too.

make install		# install the ELF libraries
make install.lite	# install the light version of the shared a.out
			$ library.

Any other switches are used at your own risk :-).

There are two mallocs, GNU malloc (malloc-930716) and malloc from Doug
Lea (dl-malloc). malloc-930716 is well tested and dl-malloc has
better performance.

If OLD_GCC is not set to "true", libgcc, crtbegin[S]/crtend[S].o will
be removed from the Linux C library. You can use the ones compiled
from the gcc source with my patch, gcc-ss-951216-linux.diff.gz. I have
sent in my patch for gcc. I hope it will get into the official source
tree soon.
				
Thanks.
