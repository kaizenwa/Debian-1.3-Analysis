"ObjectPak" is not just "another" collection class library.  ObjectPak is
a rewrite from scratch of the objects described in Brad Cox' book.
ObjectPak is largely compatible in interface with the collection classes
of Stepstone's ICpak101 (but not with the ICpak101 foundation classes).
The library comes with source code, header files, RTF and HTML documentation.

Runtime dependencies are left out of ObjectPak.  You can therefore
work with the same objects on any current or future implementation of
Objective C, yet take advantage of each particular environment : ObjectPak
has been tested on NextStep, Stepstone and GNU Objective C, and has been
ported to several Unix platforms.

Classes in ObjectPak
--------------------
ObjPak  : root class of ObjectPak
ObjStr  : string objects
ObjCltn : collections of objects, ordered
ObjSet  : sets of objects, no duplicate entries
ObjDic  : dictionaries, key-value tables
ObjSort : instances keep their contents sorted in a tree
ObjSeq  : sequencing over groups of objects

ObjectPak is an ideal starting-point for writing all sorts of text filters
or processors in Objective C : as a demonstration of what can be done,
the library comes with a small program to print a collection, a set without
duplicates, a dictionary or a sorted list of the words in a text file.

ObjectPak is public domain software.
