<H2>Class Description</H2>
Sequences are used to loop or <i>sequence</i> over a group of objects.  Typically, an <b>ObjSeq</b> instance is generated by using some method like <b>ObjCltn</b>'s <b>eachElement</b>.  Then, within a loop, one can send <b>next</b> messages to the sequence until the end is reached (when the <b>next</b> method returns <b>nil</b>).  Finally, after using the sequence, you have to free the sequence object.<p>
<H3>Warning</H3>
Using a sequence can lead to problems if, in sequencing over a collection, that collection is modified, e.g., as in the following :<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
id item;
id aSeq;

aSeq = [aCol eachElement];
while ((item = [aSeq next])) [aCol add:something]; // WRONG !!!
aSeq = [aSeq free];
</pre>
</blockquote>
You may not modify a group of objects while sequencing over its contents.<p>

<br>
<H3>copy</H3>
<blockquote>
- <b>copy</b><p>
</blockquote>
Returns a copy of the sequence.  Can be used independently of the original sequence.<p>
<br>
<br>
<H3>free</H3>
<blockquote>
- <b>free</b><p>
</blockquote>
Frees the receiver, but not the objects in the collection being sequenced over.<p>
<br>
<br>
<H3>size</H3>
<blockquote>
- (unsigned) <b>size</b><p>
</blockquote>
Returns the total number of items in the sequence.<p>
<br>
<br>
<H3>next</H3>
<blockquote>
- <b>next</b><p>
</blockquote>
Returns the next object in the sequence if there is one and advances the sequence.  When it reaches the end of the sequence, returns <b>nil</b>.<p>
<br>
<br>
<H3>peek</H3>
<blockquote>
- <b>peek</b><p>
</blockquote>
Returns the next object in the sequence if there is one, but does not advance the sequence.  When it reaches the end of the sequence, returns <b>nil</b>.<p>
<br>
<br>
<H3>previous</H3>
<blockquote>
- <b>previous</b><p>
</blockquote>
Returns the object that was returned by the last <b>next</b> message.  If there were no <b>next</b> messages since the sequence was created, or the sequence is empty, returns <b>nil</b>.  Doesn't affect the current position in the sequence.<p>
<br>
<br>
<H3>first</H3>
<blockquote>
- <b>first</b><p>
</blockquote>
Returns the first object in the sequence, unlesss there are no members in the sequence, in which case it returns <b>nil</b>.  Doesn't affect the current position in the sequence.<p>
<br>
<br>
<H3>last</H3>
<blockquote>
- <b>last</b><p>
</blockquote>
Returns the last object in the sequence, unlesss there are no members in the sequence, in which case it returns <b>nil</b>.  Doesn't affect the current position in the sequence.<p>
<br>
<br>
<H3>printToFile:</H3>
<blockquote>
- <b>printToFile</b> <b>:</b>(FILE *) <i>aFile</i><p>
</blockquote>
Prints a newline separated list of the objects in the sequence to <i>aFile</i>, by sending each individual object a <b>printToFile:</b> message.  Returns the sequence when there are no more elements left.<p>
