ObjectPak Objective C Class Library
-----------------------------------

ObjectPak is a reimplementation of some of the objects described
in Brad Cox' book.

ObjectPak works on NextStep (cc), Stepstone (objcc) or GNU Objective C (gcc)
and has been ported to several Unix platforms.

Classes in ObjectPak
--------------------

ObjPak  : root class of ObjectPak, subclass of Object
ObjStr  : string objects
ObjCltn : collections of objects, ordered
ObjSet  : sets of objects, no duplicate entries
ObjDic  : dictionaries, key-value tables
ObjSort : instances keep their contents sorted
ObjSeq  : sequencing over groups of objects

Installation
------------

Depending on your needs:

(A) INSTALLATION IN HOME DIRECTORY

	This is the easiest way to see whether the library is of interest
	to you or not : all files, including the binary library, will be
	installed under the directory "objpak"
	
	Uncompress objpak.tar.gz in your home directory.
	Compile the library : cd objpak;configure;make
	Compile the example : cd words;make
	
(B) INSTALLATION FOR USE IN MULTIPLE PROJECTS

	It's recommended to install the library and headerfiles in
	~/Developer (NextStep) or in ~/usr (other Unixes).
	You can install other object kits in these locations as well,
	and your compiler will just need a single -I or -L flag.
	
	Uncompress objpak.tar.gz in your home directory.
	Compile the library : cd objpak
	configure -prefix=~/Developer (or configure -prefix=~/usr)
	make
	Compile the example : cd words;make
	
(C) INSTALLATION FOR USE IN MULTIPLE PROJECTS BY SEVERAL DEVELOPERS

	It's best to install the sources in some location like
	/LocalDeveloper/Source or /usr/local/src
	The library will go into /usr/local/lib and the header files
	into /usr/local/include (or the corresponding dirs for NextStep).
	
	Uncompress objpak.tar.gz under /usr/local/src
	Compile the library : cd /usr/local/src/objpak
	configure -prefix=/usr/local (or configure -prefix=/LocalDeveloper)
	make

Do a configure -help for more options.  Sorry about the installation headache !

Feedback
--------

You can help making ObjectPak better ! If you find bugs, add features, port
to new platforms, improve in any other way or have suggestions, please
send e-mail and the necessary changes can perhaps be incorporated into
future versions of ObjectPak.

DISCLAIMER: I'll try to fix bugs in ObjectPak, and to continue to maintain
the library, but you agree to use the software on an "as-is" basis.
