Description
SDsetdimval sets the backward compatibility of a dimension record
for the next write of that dimension. The default mode is backward 
compatible for HDF4.0b2 and will be changed to incompatible in 
HDF4.1.

Unlimited dimension is always backward compatible. SDsetdimval_comp 
takes no action for unlimited dimension. 

In HDF4.0b1 and previous releases a dimension record was represented
by a vgroup which contains a vdata. The vdata has <dimension size> 
number of elements and the values of the elements are fake values
from 0, 1, 2, ... , <dimension size> -1. The vdata has class 
"DimVal0.0".

Starting from HDF4.0b2 a new version of dimension vdata will be 
created, which has only 1 element and the value of that element 
is the <dimension size>. The new version of vdata has class 
"DimVal0.1". 

If SD_DIMVAL_BW_INCOMP is used to set incompatible mode, 
only the vdata of "DimVal0.1" will be written to the hdf file. 
The dimension vgroup has only the "DimVal0.1" vdata. 
Tools using HDF4.0b1 or older version can not understand this 
version of dimension value, therefore can not read the SDS. 

SDsetdimval_comp(dimid, SD_DIMVAL_BW_COMP) sets compatible mode.
Both vdatas of "DimVal0.0" and of "DimVal0.1" will be written to 
the hdf file. The dimension vgroup has two vdatas, "DimVal0.0" 
and "DimVal0.1". Tools compiled with HDF4.0b1 or older HDF 
libraries can read dimension information from "DimVal0.0" 
dimension vdata. 

SDsetdimval_comp can be called any time between SDstart and SDend.
The current call overrides the mode set by previous calls.
