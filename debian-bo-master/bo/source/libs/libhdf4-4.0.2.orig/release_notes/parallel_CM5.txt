CM5 Parallel I/O Extension

    An extension using the parallel I/O in CM5 is added to the SDS
    interface.  Initial tests have resulted in about 25 MBytes/second
    IO throughput using the SDA (Scalable Disk Array) file system. The
    library provides interfaces for both C* and CMF programming
    languages.

    Read the section "Installing HDF Libraries With CM5 Parallel I/O
    Extension" for specific installation instructions.

    The parallel I/O interface requires the scientific dataset be
    stored as external elements and the I/O access type be set to
    "Parallel" before reading or writing the dataset.  Read the manual
    pages for SDsetexternalfile and SDsetaccesstype for details.  The
    mfhdf/CM5/Examples directory contains program examples in C* and
    CMF.  The extension is coded in C* but used the CMFS library.  It
    is a bit complex to link it with CMF programs.  The Examples
    directory also contains a Makefile showing how to compile and link
    in the runtime libraries.

    New options have been added to hdfls and hdfpack to handle them. A
    new utility program, hdfunpac, is created for external files
    handling too. See the man pages for details.

    A note: C* does not support the "nopadding" option that CMF does.
    CMF programs compiled with "-nopadding" (default is padding) do
    not work with the parallel I/O extension.

Installing HDF Libraries With CM5 Parallel I/O Extension

    It takes two major steps to install the HDF libraries.

    1) Compile and install the ordinary HDF libraries, include files
    and utilities according to the instructions for a SunOS machine.

    2) To make the HDF library with CM5 parallel IO extension:  There
    are two new libraries, libdfcm5.a and libmfhdfcm5.a, which are
    similar to libdf.a and libmfhdf.a.

    Configuration

	make distclean	        # remove any files created in the previous make
	./configure CM5

    Compile

	make libdf libmfhdf     # create the two parallel IO libraries

    Install
	# Install it in system area such as /usr/local/lib
	cp hdf/src/libdf.a /usr/local/lib/libdfcm5.a
	ranlib /usr/local/lib/libdfcm5.a
	cp mfhdf/libsrc/libmfhdf.a /usr/local/lib/libmfhdfcm5.a
	ranlib /usr/local/lib/libmfhdfcm5.a
