# Makefile for creating ncurses distributions.

# This only needs to be used directly as a makefile by developers, but
# configure mines the current version number out of here.  To move
# to a new version number, just edit this file and run configure.

SHELL = /bin/sh

# Below are the ncurses release version and the ncurses ABI version
# (the latter is used to build the shared library).  If two ncurses libraries
# have the same ABI version, their application binary interface must be
# identical or one must be a superset of the other.  The ABI version number
# is independent of the ncurses release version. For ncurses release
# version 1.9.5, the ABI version is 1.9.  We can have the ABI version
# 1.9a, 1.9b, 1.9foobar, ... when the ncurses release version changes
# If a new ncurses has an incompatible application binary interface than
# previous one, the ABI version should be changed.
VERSION = 1.9.9e
SHARED_ABI = 3.0
