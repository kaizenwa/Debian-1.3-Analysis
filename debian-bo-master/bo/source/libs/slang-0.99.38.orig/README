Installation instructions:

S-Lang has been successfully compiled and tested on many platforms and OSs
(Unix/VMS/PC-MSDOS/OS2).  Building the S-Lang library requires a C compiler
that understands function prototypes.  On SunOS, you will need gcc.

  VMS: INSTALL.vms
  OS/2, MSDOS, see: INSTALL.pc
  Unix: see INSTALL.unx

Also to browse the online documentation, create the help file reader in the
help directory.
