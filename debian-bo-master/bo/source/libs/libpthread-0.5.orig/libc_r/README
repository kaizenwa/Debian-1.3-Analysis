Peeter Joot (joot@VNET.IBM.COM):

  This is all lifted from libc-5.3.9 ( libc/sysdeps/pthreads/ )

  ( except malloc.c, which is from linuxthreads-0.1 )

  It has been hacked slightly in the interests of a quick compile.

  I commented dirent.c out of the header file below, as it didn't
  compile properly ( I didn't try too hard to get it to compile though ).

Xavier Leroy (Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr):

  Made dirent.c to work. Added the scanf functions.

Pavel Krauz (<kra@fsid.cvut.cz):

  Added lots of missing functions in stdio.c.
