This is version 1.2 of 3DKIT, a super fast on-the-fly rendering
library for living 3D animation, written in C by Paul Sheer.

The 3DKIT library is free software.  See the file COPYING.LIB for
copying permission.

The library consists of the following files:

  3dinit.h
  3dinit.c
  3dkit.h
  3dkit.c
  wrapsurf.c
  triangle.h
  striangle.c
  swtriangle.c
  triangle.c
  wtriangle.c


For demonstration, two additional programs are included:

planukit.c:
    A greyscale-shaded rendered-on-the-fly turbo-prop that you can rotate
    and scale however you like.

wrapdemo.c:
    Demonstrates surface wrapping of bitmaps in a similar fashion.


RUNNING THE DEMOS
-----------------

(1) Compile with:

make plane
or
make wrapdemo

(2) run with:

./plane
or
./wrapdemo

(3) use the following keys:

q and a, z and x, o and p, to rotate.
t and v, f and g, w and s, to move up, down, north, south,
				    east, west. (world view only)
SPACE to change render.
(w and s to scale in non-world view compilation -- see plane.h)
1 and 2 to change rotation increment.
3 through 9 to change surface density (plane only).
r to change shading method.

see planukit.c and triangle.c for more info, including more
keys to use when running.
