* Should the dns_*() routines be renamed to res_*() to be compatible
  with the Sun Solaris 2 libresolv.so Name Service Switch functions?

* Should the YP nickname to real map name translation table be
  hard coded in the library?

* Rewrite nsw/src/files/{hosts,...} to be more general that the
  current BSD-derived ones are (don't want no stupid limits!)

* Include herror.c into the DNS sources.

* Write the NIS+ middle layer functions
 
* Make sure the NIS+ routines are returning the same return values
  and error codes as Suns routines do.

* Implement the routines in nis/src/nis_dummy.c
 
* Implement the DNS/Hesiod middle level routines.
