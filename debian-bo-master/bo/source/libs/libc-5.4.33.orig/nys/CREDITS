Credits go to the following people who have helped with this project
(in no particular order):


	Mitch Dsouza <m.dsouza@mrc-apu.cam.ac.uk>

		Added the shared library support and made some major
		cleanups in the Makefiles


	Michael A. Griffith <grif@cs.ucr.edu>

		Helped writing some of the middle level nsw routines
		and other stuff.


I, Peter Eriksson <pen@signum.se> (or <pen@lysator.liu.se>), wrote
most of the other stuff (except for the files that I got from Gnu's
libc and the automatically generated RPC stuff - lazy me :-).
