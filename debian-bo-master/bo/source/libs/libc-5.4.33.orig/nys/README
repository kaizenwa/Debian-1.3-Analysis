This directory and subdirectories contains the sources to the NYS
library. This is a free implementation of Sun's NIS+, YP and Name
Service Switch client side functionality (and more).

Please note that these sources are far from complete. This is
an ongoing project. And all help with writing the code for
filling in the missing pieces are more than welcome. Please
get in touch with me so we can discuss who does what and how
it should be implemented!

The NYS Library is free software. See the file COPYING.LIB for
copying conditions.

Please send bug reports to bug-nyslib@signum.se

Configuration options are set in config/config.h

Install the files 'nsw/etc/nsswitch.conf', 'nis/etc/nis.conf' and
'yp/etc/yp.conf' files into the /etc directory (and modify them
to suit your setup.

I'm currently developing on machines running Linux 0.99.14c with
libc 4.5.7, and talking to YP and NIS+ servers on Suns running
SunOS 4.1.3 and Solaris 2.2.

There is a bug in the RPC functions contained in libc 4.4.1 that
prevents YP access to function properly for map entries that are
64 or 65 bytes long. There are other bugs in libc's before libc 4.5.7
that causes other troubles so I recommend that you get that one (or a
later version).

You will must use Gnu make to be able to build it. The earliest
one I've used so far is version 3.62.

There is a bug in the normal Linux "ld" (1.9l.1) that causes programs linked
with the shared library version of libnsl to crash. Please use the
"ld" that is available on ftp.lysator.liu.se in pub/NYS/bin instead
until this is fixed.

To build the static library just type "make". To build the shared library
type "make dll". To build the client programs, type "make clients".

See the file "TODO" in this directory for things to do...

May the source be with you!
