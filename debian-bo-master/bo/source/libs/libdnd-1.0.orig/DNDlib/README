HOW TO INSTALL
==============

Execute the following commands

* ./config
* make
* make install

If you are not root and want to install the files in other directory

* ./config --prefix==(directory)
* make
* make install

You should have a program dndtest in this directory. You can try out some
drags and drops now.
