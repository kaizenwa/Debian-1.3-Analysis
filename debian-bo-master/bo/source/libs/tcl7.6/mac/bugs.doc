This was a new feature as of Tcl7.6b1 and as such I'll started with
a clean slate.  I currently know of no reproducable bugs.  I often
get vague reports - but nothing I've been able to confirm.  Let
me know what bugs you find!

The Macintosh version of Tcl passes most all tests in the Tcl
test suite.  Slower Macs may fail some tests in event.test whose
timing constraints are too tight.  If other tests fail please report
them.

Bugs fixed since the release of Tcl 7.6b1

* Bug in ckrealloc - only showed up in Tk when TCL_MEM_DEBUG was
  turned off.  The mac implementation of realloc has been fixed.

* The "package require" command didn't really work before.  It now
  works much better on the Macintosh platform.
