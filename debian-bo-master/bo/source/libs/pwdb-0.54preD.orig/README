This is the Password Database library (PWDB). Thanks for downloading it.


1. This is *pre-ALPHA* software.

2. If you wish to compile this software on a platform that is not
currently supported. Please construct an OS.defs file and submit it to
the address below. Thanks..

3. There is documentation in the doc/ directory

4. the library itself is located in libpwdb/

5. 'make' should build it

6. it is probably not wise to think about doing a make install at this
stage... (you will probably need the /etc/pwdb.conf file to be
installed to play with things though.)

7. Comments/bug reports and fixes are welcome.

Please send email to morgan@parc.power.net & gafton@sorosis.ro .

[This is not really PAM specific, so please send email to us directly.
Perhaps we can think about a mailing list if there is any real
interest in this library.]
