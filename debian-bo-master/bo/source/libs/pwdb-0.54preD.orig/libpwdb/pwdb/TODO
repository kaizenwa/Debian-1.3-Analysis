Should we?:

1. make the pwdb_flags calls check to see if they can write files
before we try to update a database file. (This is to avoid the user
resetting the passwd file to be blank problem).

2. Work on NIS groups interface. No NIS groups support is provided at this
stage.

3. Provide a generic interface for logging problems. Cut off
fprintf(stderr,...) calls.

4. Add support for Merit radiusd extensions.

5. TACACS and Kerberos modules still need to be written.

6. Look over the code again and test for race condition in every
possible place.
