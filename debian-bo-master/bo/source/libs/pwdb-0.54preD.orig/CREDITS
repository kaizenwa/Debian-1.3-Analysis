We would like acknowledge the contributions of the following people:

	John F. Haugh <jfh@rpp386.cactus.org>,
		the author of the original shadow suite;

	Marek Michalkiewicz <marekm@i17linuxb.ists.pwr.wroc.pl>,
		the current maintainer of the shadow suite under Linux.

The shadow module code included here was written specifically for this
library, but was derived from the previous work of these people. To 
them we offer our thanks and appreciation.
