exit(n)                Tk Built-In Commands               exit(n)


NAME
       exit - Exit the process

SYNOPSIS
       exit ?returnCode?


DESCRIPTION
       Terminate  the  process, returning returnCode (an integer)
       to the system as the exit  status.   If  returnCode  isn't
       specified  then  it  defaults to 0.  This command replaces
       the Tcl command by the same  name.   It  is  identical  to
       Tcl's  exit command except that before exiting it destroys
       all the windows managed by the process.  This allows vari-
       ous  cleanup  operations to be performed, such as removing
       application names from the  global  registry  of  applica-
       tions.
