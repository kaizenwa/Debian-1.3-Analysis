WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           command
       Class:          Command
       Command-Line Switch:-command

              Specifies a Tcl command to associate with the  but-
              ton.   This command is typically invoked when mouse
              button 1 is released over the button  window.   The
              button's global variable (-variable option) will be
              updated before the command is invoked.

       Name:           height
       Class:          Height
       Command-Line Switch:-height

              Specifies a desired height for the button.   If  an
              image  or  bitmap  is being displayed in the button
              then the value is in screen units (i.e. any of  the
              forms  acceptable  to Tk_GetPixels); for text it is
              in lines of text.  If this option isn't  specified,
              the  button's  desired  height is computed from the
              size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed
              in it.

       Name:           indicatorOn
       Class:          IndicatorOn
       Command-Line Switch:-indicatoron

              Specifies  whether  or  not the indicator should be
              drawn.  Must be a proper boolean value.  If  false,
              the  relief  option  is  ignored  and  the widget's
              relief is always sunken if the widget  is  selected
              and raised otherwise.

       Name:           offValue
       Class:          Value
       Command-Line Switch:-offvalue



Tk                             4.0                              1





checkbutton(n)         Tk Built-In Commands        checkbutton(n)


              Specifies value to store in the button's associated
              variable  whenever  this  button   is   deselected.
              Defaults to ``0''.

       Name:           onValue
       Class:          Value
       Command-Line Switch:-onvalue

              Specifies value to store in the button's associated
              variable  whenever   this   button   is   selected.
              Defaults to ``1''.

       Name:           selectColor
       Class:          Background
       Command-Line Switch:-selectcolor

              Specifies a background color to use when the button
              is selected.  If indicatorOn is true then the color
              applicies  to  the  indicator.   If  indicatorOn is
              false, this color is used as the background for the
              entire  widget,  in  place of background or active-
              Background, whenever the widget  is  selected.   If
              specified  as an empty string then no special color
              is used for displaying when the widget is selected.

       Name:           selectImage
       Class:          SelectImage
       Command-Line Switch:-selectimage

              Specifies  an  image  to  display  (in place of the
              image option) when  the  checkbutton  is  selected.
              This  option is ignored unless the image option has
              been specified.

       Name:           state
       Class:          State
       Command-Line Switch:-state

              Specifies one of three states for the  checkbutton:
              normal,  active,  or disabled.  In normal state the
              checkbutton is displayed using the  foreground  and
              background  options.  The active state is typically
              used when the pointer is over the checkbutton.   In
              active state the checkbutton is displayed using the
              activeForeground  and   activeBackground   options.
              Disabled state means that the checkbutton should be
              insensitive:  the default bindings will  refuse  to
              activate  the  widget  and will ignore mouse button
              presses.  In this state the disabledForeground  and
              background options determine how the checkbutton is
              displayed.

       Name:           variable
       Class:          Variable



Tk                             4.0                              2





checkbutton(n)         Tk Built-In Commands        checkbutton(n)


       Command-Line Switch:-variable

              Specifies name of global variable to set  to  indi-
              cate  whether  or  not  this  button  is  selected.
              Defaults to the name of the button within its  par-
              ent  (i.e.  the last element of the button window's
              path name).

       Name:           width
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:-width

              Specifies a desired width for the  button.   If  an
              image  or  bitmap  is being displayed in the button
              then the value is in screen units (i.e. any of  the
              forms  acceptable  to Tk_GetPixels); for text it is
              in characters.  If this option isn't specified, the
              button's desired width is computed from the size of
              the image or bitmap or text being displayed in  it.


DESCRIPTION
       The checkbutton command creates a new window (given by the
       pathName argument) and makes it into a checkbutton widget.
       Additional  options,  described above, may be specified on
       the command line or in the option  database  to  configure
       aspects of the checkbutton such as its colors, font, text,
       and initial relief.  The checkbutton command  returns  its
       pathName  argument.   At the time this command is invoked,
       there must not exist a window named  pathName,  but  path-
       Name's parent must exist.

       A  checkbutton is a widget that displays a textual string,
       bitmap or image and a square called an indicator.  If text
       is  displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it can
       occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it  contains  new-
       lines  or  if  wrapping  occurs  because of the wrapLength
       option) and one of the characters may optionally be under-
       lined  using  the underline option.  A checkbutton has all
       of the behavior of a simple button, including the  follow-
       ing:  it  can  display itself in either of three different
       ways, according to the state option; it  can  be  made  to
       appear  raised,  sunken, or flat; it can be made to flash;
       and it invokes a Tcl command whenever mouse  button  1  is
       clicked over the checkbutton.

       In addition, checkbuttons can be selected.  If a checkbut-
       ton is selected then the indicator is normally drawn  with
       a  sunken  relief  and a special color, and a Tcl variable
       associated with the checkbutton is  set  to  a  particular
       value  (normally  1).  If the checkbutton is not selected,
       then the indicator is drawn with a raised  relief  and  no
       special  color,  and  the  associated variable is set to a
       different value (typically 0).  By default,  the  name  of

checkbutton(n)         Tk Built-In Commands        checkbutton(n)


       the  variable associated with a checkbutton is the same as
       the name used to create  the  checkbutton.   The  variable
       name,  and the ``on'' and ``off'' values stored in it, may
       be modified with options on the command  line  or  in  the
       option  database.   Configuration options may also be used
       to modify the way the indicator is displayed  (or  whether
       it is displayed at all).  By default a checkbutton is con-
       figured to select and deselect itself on alternate  button
       clicks.   In addition, each checkbutton monitors its asso-
       ciated variable and automatically  selects  and  deselects
       itself  when  the  variables value changes to and from the
       button's ``on'' value.


WIDGET COMMAND
       The checkbutton command creates a new  Tcl  command  whose
       name is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke var-
       ious operations on the widget.  It has the following  gen-
       eral form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option  and  the  args determine the exact behavior of the
       command.  The following commands are possible  for  check-
       button widgets:

       pathName cget option
              Returns  the  current  value  of  the configuration
              option given by option.  Option may have any of the
              values accepted by the checkbutton command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query  or  modify  the configuration options of the
              widget.  If no option is specified, returns a  list
              describing  all  of the available options for path-
              Name (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information  on  the
              format  of this list).  If option is specified with
              no value, then the command returns a list  describ-
              ing the one named option (this list will be identi-
              cal to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the  value
              returned  if  no  option  is specified).  If one or
              more option-value pairs  are  specified,  then  the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the  command
              returns  an  empty  string.  Option may have any of
              the values accepted by the checkbutton command.

       pathName deselect
              Deselects the checkbutton and sets  the  associated
              variable to its ``off'' value.

       pathName flash
              Flashes  the  checkbutton.  This is accomplished by
              redisplaying   the   checkbutton   several   times,



Tk                             4.0                              4





checkbutton(n)         Tk Built-In Commands        checkbutton(n)


              alternating  between  active and normal colors.  At
              the end of the flash the checkbutton is left in the
              same  normal/active  state  as when the command was
              invoked.  This command is ignored if the  checkbut-
              ton's state is disabled.

       pathName invoke
              Does  just  what  would  have  happened if the user
              invoked the checkbutton with the mouse: toggle  the
              selection  state  of  the button and invoke the Tcl
              command associated with the checkbutton,  if  there
              is  one.  The return value is the return value from
              the Tcl command, or an empty string if there is  no
              command associated with the checkbutton.  This com-
              mand is ignored if the checkbutton's state is  dis-
              abled.

       pathName select
              Selects  the  checkbutton  and  sets the associated
              variable to its ``on'' value.

       pathName toggle
              Toggles the selection state of the  button,  redis-
              playing it and modifying its associated variable to
              reflect the new state.


BINDINGS
       Tk automatically creates class bindings  for  checkbuttons
       that give them the following default behavior:

       [1]    A  checkbutton  activates whenever the mouse passes
              over it and deactivates whenever the  mouse  leaves
              the checkbutton.

       [2]    When  mouse  button 1 is pressed over a checkbutton
              it is invoked (its selection state toggles and  the
              command  associated  with the button is invoked, if
              there is one).

       [3]    When a checkbutton has the input focus,  the  space
              key causes the checkbutton to be invoked.

       If  the  checkbutton's  state is disabled then none of the
       above actions occur:  the checkbutton is  completely  non-
       responsive.

       The  behavior  of  checkbuttons can be changed by defining
       new bindings for individual widgets or by  redefining  the
       class bindings.
