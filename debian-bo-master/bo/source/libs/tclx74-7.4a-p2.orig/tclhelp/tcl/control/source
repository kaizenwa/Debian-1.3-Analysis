NAME
       source - Evaluate a file as a Tcl script

SYNOPSIS
       source fileName


DESCRIPTION
       Read file fileName and pass the contents to the Tcl inter-
       preter as a script to evaluate in the normal fashion.  The
       return  value  from source is the return value of the last
       command executed from the file.  If  an  error  occurs  in
       evaluating  the  contents of the file then the source com-
       mand will return that  error.   If  a  return  command  is
       invoked  from  within  the  file then the remainder of the
       file will be skipped and the source  command  will  return
       normally  with  the  result  from  the return command.  If
       fileName starts with a tilde, then it is tilde-substituted
       as described in the Tcl_TildeSubst manual entry.
