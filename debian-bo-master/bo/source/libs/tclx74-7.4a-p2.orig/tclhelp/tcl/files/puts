NAME
       puts - Write to a file

SYNOPSIS
       puts ?-nonewline? ?fileId? string


DESCRIPTION
       Writes the characters given by string to the file given by
       fileId.  FileId must have been the  return  value  from  a
       previous  call  to  open, or it may be stdout or stderr to
       refer to one of the standard I/O channels; it  must  refer
       to  a  file  that was opened for writing.  If no fileId is
       specified then it defaults to stdout.  Puts normally  out-
       puts  a  newline  character after string, but this feature
       may be suppressed by  specifying  the  -nonewline  switch.
       Output  to  files is buffered internally by Tcl; the flush
       command may be used to force  buffered  characters  to  be
       output.


KEYWORDS
       file, newline, output, write
