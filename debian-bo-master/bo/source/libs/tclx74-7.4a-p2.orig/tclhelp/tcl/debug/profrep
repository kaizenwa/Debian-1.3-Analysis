       profrep profDataVar sortKey ?outFile? ?userTitle?
              This procedure generates a report from data collect
              from the profile command.  ProfDataVar is the  name
              of  the  array  containing the data returned by the
              profile command. SortKey indicates which data value
              to  sort by.  It should be one of "calls", "cpu" or
              "real".  OutFile is the name of file to  write  the
              report to.  If omitted, stdout is assumed.  UserTi-
              tle is an optional title line to add to output.
