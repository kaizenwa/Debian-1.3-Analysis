       server_send ?options? fileid string
              Send  the specified string to the TCP/IP connection
              corresponding to fileid.  Theserver_send command is
              provide  as  an  option  to  puts  for writing to a
              socket as it is better at  detecting  lost  connec-
              tions  and other IP-related error conditions.  File
              buffering is ignored for server_send. There  is  no
              need  to flush after a server_send.  The results of
              mixing server_send with puts without  flushing  the
              puts output is indeterminate.

              Options are:

              o -nonewline  - Don't append a newline character to
              the end of the message.  The default is to append a
              newline character.

              o -dontroute  -  Requests  that routing be bypassed
              and the direct interface used (usually used only by
              diagnostic or routing programs)

              o -outofband - Send out-of-band data on the socket.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
