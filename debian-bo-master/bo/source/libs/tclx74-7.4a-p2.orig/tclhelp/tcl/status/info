NAME
       info  -  Return  information  about  the  state of the Tcl
       interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       info option ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This command provides information about various  internals
       of  the Tcl interpreter.  The legal option's (which may be
       abbreviated) are:

       info args procname
              Returns a list containing the names  of  the  argu-
              ments  to  procedure  procname, in order.  Procname
              must be the name of a Tcl command procedure.

       info body procname
              Returns the body of procedure  procname.   Procname
              must be the name of a Tcl command procedure.

       info cmdcount
              Returns  a  count  of  the total number of commands
              that have been invoked in this interpreter.

       info commands ?pattern?
              If pattern isn't specified, returns a list of names
              of  all the Tcl commands, including both the built-
              in commands written in C and the command procedures
              defined  using  the  proc  command.   If pattern is
              specified, only those names  matching  pattern  are
              returned.   Matching  is  determined using the same
              rules as for string match.

       info complete command
              Returns 1 if command is a complete Tcl  command  in
              the  sense  of  having  no unclosed quotes, braces,
              brackets or array element  names,  If  the  command
              doesn't  appear  to be complete then 0 is returned.
              This command is  typically  used  in  line-oriented
              input  environments  to allow users to type in com-
              mands that span multiple  lines;   if  the  command
              isn't  complete, the script can delay evaluating it
              until additional lines have been typed to  complete
              the command.

       info default procname arg varname
              Procname  must  be the name of a Tcl command proce-
              dure and arg must be the name  of  an  argument  to
              that  procedure.   If  arg  doesn't  have a default
              value then the command  returns  0.   Otherwise  it
              returns  1 and places the default value of arg into
              variable varname.

info(n)               Tcl Built-In Commands               info(n)


       info exists varName
              Returns 1 if the variable named varName  exists  in
              the  current  context  (either as a global or local
              variable), returns 0 otherwise.

       info globals ?pattern?
              If pattern isn't specified, returns a list  of  all
              the  names  of  currently-defined global variables.
              If pattern is specified, only those names  matching
              pattern are returned.  Matching is determined using
              the same rules as for string match.

       info level ?number?
              If number is not specified, this command returns  a
              number  giving the stack level of the invoking pro-
              cedure, or 0 if the  command  is  invoked  at  top-
              level.   If number is specified, then the result is
              a list consisting of the name and arguments for the
              procedure  call  at  level number on the stack.  If
              number is positive then  it  selects  a  particular
              stack level (1 refers to the top-most active proce-
              dure, 2 to the procedure it  called,  and  so  on);
              otherwise  it gives a level relative to the current
              level (0 refers to the current procedure, -1 to its
              caller,  and  so  on).  See the uplevel command for
              more information on what stack levels mean.

       info library
              Returns the name of the library directory in  which
              standard  Tcl scripts are stored.  This is actually
              the value of the tcl_library variable  and  may  be
              changed  by  setting  tcl_library.  See the tclvars
              manual entry for more information.

       info locals ?pattern?
              If pattern isn't specified, returns a list  of  all
              the  names  of  currently-defined  local variables,
              including arguments to the  current  procedure,  if
              any.   Variables  defined with the global and upvar
              commands will not be returned.  If pattern is spec-
              ified,   only  those  names  matching  pattern  are
              returned.  Matching is determined  using  the  same
              rules as for string match.

       info patchlevel
              Returns   the   value   of   the   global  variable
              tcl_patchLevel; see the tclvars  manual  entry  for
              more information.

       info procs ?pattern?
              If  pattern  isn't specified, returns a list of all
              the names of Tcl command procedures.  If pattern is
              specified,  only  those  names matching pattern are
              returned.  Matching is determined  using  the  same

              rules as for string match.

       info script
              If  a  Tcl script file is currently being evaluated
              (i.e. there is a call  to  Tcl_EvalFile  active  or
              there  is  an  active invocation of the source com-
              mand), then this command returns the  name  of  the
              innermost file being processed.  Otherwise the com-
              mand returns an empty string.

       info tclversion
              Returns  the   value   of   the   global   variable
              tcl_version;  see the tclvars manual entry for more
              information.

       info vars ?pattern?
              If pattern isn't specified, returns a list  of  all
              the names of currently-visible variables, including
              both locals and currently-visible globals.  If pat-
              tern  is  specified, only those names matching pat-
              tern are returned.  Matching  is  determined  using
              the same rules as for string match.
