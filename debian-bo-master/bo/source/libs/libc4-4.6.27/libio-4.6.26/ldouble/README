The functions in this directory go under libc-linux/libio/ldouble.
They implement `L' for `long double' in *printf and *scanf.

iovfprintf.c, iovfscanf.c, outfloat.c are modified versions of the
files in libc-4.6.22, which in turn come from libg++.  ioldouble.c is
a new file that does binary <-> decimal conversion for long double
values; it uses the same method as gcc-2.4.x and later, which is
supposed to be compliant with the IEEE 754 and IEEE 854 standards.

The conversions have been checked by tfformat.c, which comes from the
libg++ distribution, by ieeetest.zoo which is at usc.edu, and on all
powers of ten from 10^-4931 to 10^+4931.
