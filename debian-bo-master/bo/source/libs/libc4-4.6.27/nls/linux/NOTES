English speakers need do nothing !! Do NOT install the catalog "libc.cat"
unless you want change the text to be more explanatory/informative. If you
just wanna see the libc cataloging in action just do a "make check" in this
directory and then a make install will install the catalog. From now on all
libc internal messages will be prepended with a X- (for example
"X-Permission denied")

If you are translating messages please read the README.editing and
README.translate files.

I wrote a small awk (well GNU's gawk actually) script to extract strings from
source files to make them message files. Try:
	./extract ../../sysdeps/linux/_errlist.c
Not very clever, but it works. Gawk-2.15.3 broke this awk script so you must
use the flex binary `xtract' instead. Just type "make xtract" and use this
instead of `extract' in the example above.

As of 24th Oct 1993 I only have German errlist messages.

If you find a bug or feel a libc message might have been forgotten to be
catalog'ed (very possible) then please don't hesitate to contact me.
