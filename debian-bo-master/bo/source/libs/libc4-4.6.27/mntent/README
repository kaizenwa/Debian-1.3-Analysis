H.J.,

Here is some new stuff for the next library release.  statfs.c and 
fstatfs.c contain stubs for the new system calls implemented with Linus' 
latest patch.  mntent.c contains BSD4.3 style mount entry routines.  I 
chose the BSD4.3 style because it could all be done in library code,
looked easy enough to do and the new system calls were also BSD4.3 style.
I'm not sure if everything is absolutely correct (especially addmntent), 
but it works well enough for GNU df and find.  mntent.h is the mount 
entry header file and goes in /usr/include.  mntent.1 is the SunOS manual
page for the mount entry stuff.
