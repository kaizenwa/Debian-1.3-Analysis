Fixed a security hole dealing with NIS and passwd entries of the form
+username and -username.  Thanks to Arno Schaefer for finding it and
to Kai Henningsen for passing it along.

Moved libdb.so.1.85.1 from /usr/i486-linuxaout/lib to
/usr/lib/i486-linuxaout.  You no longer need the /usr/i486-linuxaout
directory unless you install the libc4-dev package.

Fixed a bug in getpriority where the returned value was off by 5.

Added the beginnings of an FAQ in /usr/doc/libc4/FAQ.
