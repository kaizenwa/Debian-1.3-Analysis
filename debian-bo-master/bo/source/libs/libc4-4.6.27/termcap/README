This is the new termcap library for Linux. It consists of
two source files:

1. termcap.c   -  written form scratch by me
2. tparam.c    -  this is the the GNU emacs or glibc tparam.c

The new tgetent in termcap.c checks for overflow of the
termcap buffer, which most applications assume is 1024 characters.
Furthermore it eliminates duplicate entries and checks for
loops caused by the include capability "tc=".

The termcap.c code falls under the LGPL.
(Library version of GNU Public License).

If you create termcap files with many levels of indirection
(with the tc= variable) this code will work allright, but the
internal buffer of software that uses it's own tgetent() function
will probably overflow, if it even supports "tc". It is therefore
always a good idea to include a "eval `tset -s $TERM`" in your
/etc/profile (assuming that tset uses the new termcap library!),
because that initializes the TERMCAP variable. The whole, small
termcap entry will then be stored in TERMCAP. Most if not all
tgetent() implementations check for a TERMCAP environment variable
first before searching /etc/termcap.

The original README and NEWS files are included below.

========== Original README ===========

This is the GNU termcap library -- a library of C functions that
enable programs to send control strings to terminals in a way
independent of the terminal type.  Most of this package is also
distributed with GNU Emacs, but it is available in this separate
distribution to make it easier to install as -ltermcap.

The GNU termcap library does not place an arbitrary limit on the size
of termcap entries, unlike most other termcap libraries.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

Please report any bugs in this library to bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu.
You can check which version of the library you have by using the RCS
`ident' command on libtermcap.a.
