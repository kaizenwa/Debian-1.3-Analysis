You should do

configure

first to generate the "config.in."

make clean
make depend

Then you can do

make			# compile all the a.out libraries.

make LITE=true		# for light version shared library. no libm.a.
			# no stub libraries are built.

make ELF=true           # to build all the ELF libraries

You can add SHADOW_COMPAT=true to turn on the shadow password support,
which may slow down your applications. You also need to reenable the
shadow functions in jump/libc/jump.funcs.

make install.elf	# install the ELF libraries
make install		# install the a.out libraries
make install.lite	# install the light version of the shared a.out
			$ library.

Any other switches are used at your own risk :-).

Thanks.
