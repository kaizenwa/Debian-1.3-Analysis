Can you add this stuff to our libc for 4.4.5?  It wont break anything
and it will add compatibility with those people who use shadow passwords.
I don't use shadow passwords myself but they have created a lot of problems
in the Linux community which I want to resolve.  So I took just the key
pieces out of the shadow suite and added them to libc.  This way,
getpwnam works whether or not you have shadow passwords installed.

libc.diffs	diffs against libc-linux
shadow.c	goes into libc/pwd/shadow.c
gshadow.c	goes into libc/grp/shadow.c
shadow.h	new shadow.h goes into usr/include/shadow.h
pwd.h		new pwd.h goes into usr/include/pwd.h
