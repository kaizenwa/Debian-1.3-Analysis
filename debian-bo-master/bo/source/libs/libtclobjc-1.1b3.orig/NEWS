Noteworthy changes in 1.1b2

   * gcc 2.7.0 (or newer) and tcl 7.4 (or newer) are required.

Noteworthy changes in 1.0
=========================

   * The library has been ported to work under NEXTSTEP.  Thanks to
     Robert Stabl <stabl@informatik.uni-muenchen.de> for doing the port.

   * Tk is now optional.  Many minor bug fixes and cleanups.

Noteworthy changes in 0.2.
==========================

   * Installation should now be much easier.  Configuration is managed
     by a script created by autoconf.  Much nicer Makefile.  I removed
     the dependence on libcoll, readline, and GNU make.  Readline is now
     optional.

   * Some new features:  Classnames now available as arguments.  New tcl
     command `tclObjc_msg_send'.

   * Many cleanups and bug fixes: Catch messages in tcl proc `unknown'
     instead of filling up the command hashtable.  Cleaner argframe
     allocation.

   See the `ChangeLog' file for more detail.
