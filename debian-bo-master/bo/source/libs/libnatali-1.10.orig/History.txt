1.00, 10 January 1996

First public release

1.10, 17 January 1996--25 April 1996.

Fixed pap_look() so it fails if natali_pap_eventhandler() fails.  This bug
caused it to fail to recognize timeouts.

Fixed debugging code in natali_pap.c which expressed the time since the last
tickle packet with the wrong sign.

Fixed bug in paps_open().  Uninitialized members of the PAP structure could
cause incorrect return values from pap_look().  Patch submitted by Damian
Ivereigh <damian@cisco.com>.

Acting on a hint from Damian Ivereigh, added code to start_tickling to set
pap->pap_connexion_request to FALSE to prevent spurious connexion reports by
pap_look().

Added code to cause paps_get_next_job() to fail if there was not connexion
request.

Changed nbp_remove() so that it always calls nbp_unrgstr() with a zone of
"*".  This works around an appearent bug in Netatalk.  (Suggested by Damian
Ivereigh.)

Added code to publick *.h files so that NATALI can be called from C++.
