  TIX 4.0.1

    Released on Jan 10, 1996

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.0.1 is available

   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.0.1, the
   first patched version of Tix 4.0. Please see the "What's New" section
   below for changes since the last release.

  REQUIREMENT

   TK 4.0 + TCL 7.4, with or without patches. It doesn't work with Tk
   4.1a* and Tcl 7.5a* yet. Tix 4.0 does not work with previous versions
   of TK and TCL. Versions of Tix that work with previous versions of TK
   and TCL can be found in the FTP directories listed below.

  GETTING THE TIX PACKAGE

   You can obtain Tix from the following ftp site:
   ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.0.1.tar.gz

   I have also uploaded the file to the official Tcl site, so in a few
   days it will also be available at:
        ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.1.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.1.README

  WHAT'S NEW SINCE TIX 4.0 (THE LAST RELEASE)
    1. The HList widget now supports "indicators" (the plus and minus
       signs next to the entries), which can be used to collapse or
       expand entries.

    2. The HList widget now supports headers.

    3. New widget "TixTree" can be used to display general hierachical
       data structures.

    4. The et/ subdirectory is better organized. The file etixAppInit.c
       is much simplified and most the ugly stuff moved to etixInit.c. It
       should be easy to use to create new applications that uses both
       Tix and ET.

    5. New display item type: image. It is basically a stripped-down
       imagetext item.

    6. Miscellaneous bugs fixed.

    7. The Tix Home Page has been moved to a new site:
       http://www.xpi.com/tix.
