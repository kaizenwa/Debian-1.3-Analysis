<h3>What's New Since Tix 4.0.3 (the last release)</h3>

<h4>2/12/96</h4>

  <b>Bug fix:</b> The balloon was not keeping the button states
  correctly and not appear again after the user clicks the mouse
  several times, especially during grab transitions. <p>

<h4>2/15/96</h4>

  <b>Bug fix:</b> ComboBox didn't react to paste events properly. <p>

  <b>Bug fix:</b> XPM reader wasn't parsing the header properly and
  couldn't read any XPM files that heas the header "/* XPM2 */". <p>

<h4>2/16/96</h4>

  <b>Bug fix:</b> NoteBook no longer complains when all of the pages
  have been deleted. <p>

  <b>New feature:</b> New command refresh for DirTree. <p>

<h4>2/17/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> New option -ignoreinvoke added to TixVTree: if
  set to false, the branch of the tree is not opened/closed if the
  user invokes an entry in the tree <p>.

  used to be exported by Tk. <p>

  <b>New feature:</b> New color scheme "Bisque" that looks similar (bu
  not identical) to the color scheme of Tk 3.6.<p>

  <b>Changes:</b> New command "flash" for ComboBox. ComboBox doesn't
  automatically flash anymore when the user selects an entry. You have
  to call "flash" explicitly. <p>

  <b>Changes:</b> Major changes in Schemes:
  <ul>

    <li> Menu font is changed to an upright bold font, instead
	 of the old italic bold font.

    <li> Menu buttons and NoteBook tabs now have more padding.

  </ul>
  
<h4>2/27/96</h4>

  <b>Incompatible Changes:</b> All %E substitutions have been changed
  to %V substitutions. The HList widgets supported an undocumented
  feature: Any string %E in the -command or -browsecmd option will be
  substituted by the current highlighted entry. This has been changed
  to %V to advoid name conflict with TK.<p>

<h4>2/28/96</h4>

  <b>Bug fix:</b> The XPM reader didn't handle properly the color
  names that contain space characters.<p>

  file.<p>

  specifies a command to be executed when the user presses the "file"
  button. Can be used to customize the file dialog before it pops up. <p>

  <b>New feature:</b> New option -dynamicgeometry for
  tixOptionMenu. When set to false (the default), the size of the
  menubutton subwidget will be wide enough to display every menu entry
  fully and does not change when the user selects different entries. <p>
