                                 INTRODUCTION

   This version of Tix supports only the Unix platforms.
     _________________________________________________________________

                              UNIX INSTALLATION

  REQUIREMENTS

   This version of Tix can be compiled to run under several
   configurations on Unix platforms.
     * Tcl 7.4/Tk4.0: Requires the final release of Tcl 7.4 and Tk 4.0
       (with or without the p1, p2 and p3 patches).
     * Tcl 7.5/Tk4.1: Requires the final release of Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1
       (released on April 21, 1996). Does not work with the alpha or beta
       versions of Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1.
     * ITcl 2.0: Requires the final release of Tcl 7.4 and Tk 4.0 and
       ITcl 2.0.

  INSTALLING TIXWISH

   This release of Tix supports the GNU autoconf utility. It should
   compile and run with little or no effort on any UNIX-like system that
   approximates POSIX, BSD, or System V and runs the X Window System. I
   know that it runs on Sun (Solaris and SunOS) and SGI workstations and
   also works on Linux boxes.

   Please follow steps when compiling and installing Tix:
    1. Make sure that this directory and the corresponding release of Tcl
       and Tk are both subdirectories of the same directory. In short, if
       you store the source distributions in the directory
       /home/blah/src/, then it should directory structure should look
       like this,:

       /home/blah/src/tcl7.4/
       /home/blah/src/tk4.0/
       /home/blah/src/Tix4.0.5/

   If you want to compile Tix with Tcl7.5/Tk 4.0, you should have these
       additional directories in your source tree:

       /home/blah/src/tcl7.5/
       /home/blah/src/tk4.1/

   If you want to compile Tix with ITcl 2.0, you should have the
       following directory in your source tree:

       /home/blah/src/itcl2.0/

    2. Run the Tix setup program to configure the Tix library. This
       program will allow you to choose various options such as which
       version(s) of Tcl/Tk you want to compile with, the location of the
       Tcl/Tk libraries, etc. To run the setup program, type "./setup" in
       the toplevel directory. This program is a GUI front-end for the
       GNU "configure" script. The set of available options are described
       in the the program.

       Before running setup, make sure that you have the program wish4.0
       installed on your system (usually in /usr/local/bin/wish4.0). If
       not, you can start the setup program by typing

       wish setup

       Alternatively, you can use the GNU configure script to configure
       the Tix package. The set of available options can be found by
       doing the following:

       cd Tix4.0.5/
       ./configure --help

    3. After running setup or configure, you should get a set of
       Makefile's. Now type "make" in the toplevel directory of Tix.
       This will create several executables, library archives and/or
       dynamic libraries for you, depending on the options you have
       chosen in while running setup:

          + unix-tk4.0/libtix.a: library archive with Tcl 7.4/Tk 4.0.
          + unix-tk4.0/tixwish: executable with Tcl 7.4/Tk 4.0.
          + unix-tk4.1/libtix.a: library archive with Tcl 7.5/Tk 4.1.
          + unix-tk4.1/tixwish: executable with Tcl 7.5/Tk 4.1.
          + unix-tk4.1/libtix.so: (or some other name) dynamic library
            with Tcl 7.5/Tk 4.1.
          + unix-itcl2.0/libtix.a: library archive with ITcl 2.0/Tcl
            7.4/Tk 4.0.
          + unix-itcl2.0/itixwish: executable with ITcl 2.0/Tcl 7.4/Tk
            4.0.

    4. If make fails then you'll have to personalize the Makefile's for
       your site or possibly modify the distribution in other ways. First
       check the files docs/FAQ.html and docs/Porting.html to see if
       there are hints for compiling on your system. If you need to
       modify Makefile's, there are comments at the beginning of it that
       describe the things you might want to change and how to change
       them.

    5. If you are paranoid, these is a small set of test scripts that
       tests the behavior of Tix under various configurations. You can
       type "make test" to run these tests. Hopefully it will report "0
       error(s) found".

    6. Type "make install" to install Tix's binaries and script files in
       standard places. In the default configuration information will be
       installed in /usr/local so you'll need write permission on this
       directory. If you'd like to use a default installation directory,
       you can change the "exec_prefix" and "prefix" definitions in the
       Makefile's.

    7. At this point you can play with Tcl by invoking the "tixwish"
       program and typing Tcl commands. However, if you haven't installed
       Tix then you'll first need to set your TIX_LIBRARY environment
       variable to hold the full path name of the "Tix4.0.5/library"
       subdirectory. You could try doing the following in the Unix C
       Shell or Bourne Shell

     env TIX_LIBRARY=/PATH/TO/TIX/SOURCES/library ./tixwish
   If you haven't installed Tcl and/or Tk then you'll need to set your
       TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY environment variable as well (see the
       Tcl and Tk README files for information on this).

   If you have trouble compiling Tix, I'd suggest looking at the files
   docs/FAQ.html and docs/Porting.html. It contains information that
   people have sent me about changes they had to make to compile Tix in
   various environments.

   I make no guarantees that this information is accurate, complete, or
   up-to-date, but you may find it useful. If you get Tix running on a
   new configuration and had to make non-trivial changes to do it, I'd be
   happy to receive new information to add to docs/Porting.html. I'm also
   interested in hearing how to change the configuration setup so that
   Tix compiles on additional platforms "out of the box". If you have
   compiled and/or installed multiple versions of Tk and Tix on your
   machine, make sure you are compile tix with the correct version of the
   Tk header files. If you get a core dump as soon as you start tixwish,
   please refer to the FAQ .
