  WHAT'S NEW SINCE TIX 4.0.3 (THE LAST RELEASE)

    2/12/96

   Bug fix: The balloon was not keeping the button states correctly and
   not appear again after the user clicks the mouse several times,
   especially during grab transitions.

    2/15/96

   Bug fix: ComboBox didn't react to paste events properly.

   Bug fix: XPM reader wasn't parsing the header properly and couldn't
   read any XPM files that heas the header "/* XPM2 */".

    2/16/96

   Bug fix: NoteBook no longer complains when all of the pages have been
   deleted.

   New feature: New command refresh for DirTree.

    2/17/96

   New feature: New option -ignoreinvoke added to TixVTree: if set to
   false, the branch of the tree is not opened/closed if the user invokes
   an entry in the tree

   . Bug fix: Tix no longer uses the tkNormalUid variable that used to be
   exported by Tk.

    2/18/96

   New feature: New class tixListNoteBook.

    2/22/96

   New feature: New color scheme "Bisque" that looks similar (bu not
   identical) to the color scheme of Tk 3.6.

   Changes: New command "flash" for ComboBox. ComboBox doesn't
   automatically flash anymore when the user selects an entry. You have
   to call "flash" explicitly.

   Changes: Major changes in Schemes:
     * Menu font is changed to an upright bold font, instead of the old
       italic bold font.
     * Menu buttons and NoteBook tabs now have more padding.

    2/27/96

   Incompatible Changes: All %E substitutions have been changed to %V
   substitutions. The HList widgets supported an undocumented feature:
   Any string %E in the -command or -browsecmd option will be substituted
   by the current highlighted entry. This has been changed to %V to
   advoid name conflict with TK.

    2/28/96

   Bug fix: The XPM reader didn't handle properly the color names that
   contain space characters.

   Bug fix: The ScrolledWindow widget didn't resize the scrollbars
   accordingly when the client window changed its size.

    2/29/96

   Bug fix: The XPM reader didn't handle quotation properly. Also, now it
   can handle comments anywhere in the XPM image file.

    3/1/96

   New feature: New command -activatecmd for FileEnt widget: it specifies
   a command to be executed when the user presses the "file" button. Can
   be used to customize the file dialog before it pops up.

   New feature: New option -dynamicgeometry for tixOptionMenu. When set
   to false (the default), the size of the menubutton subwidget will be
   wide enough to display every menu entry fully and does not change when
   the user selects different entries.

   New Doc: NBFrame documentation is available.
