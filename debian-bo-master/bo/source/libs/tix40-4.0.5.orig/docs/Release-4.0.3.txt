  TIX 4.0.3

    Released on Feb 8, 1996

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.0.3 is available

   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.0.3, the
   second patched version of Tix 4.0. Please see the "What's New" section
   below for changes since the last release.

  REQUIREMENT

   Tix 4.0.3 works with the following combinations of Tcl/Tk/ITcl/ET:
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ITcl 2.0
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ET
     * Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 (a2 or b1), supports dynamic loading.

  GETTING THE TIX PACKAGE

   You can obtain Tix from the following ftp site:
   ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.0.3.tar.gz

   I have also uploaded the file to the official Tcl site, so in a few
   days it will also be available at:
        ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.3.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.3.README

  WHAT'S NEW SINCE TIX 4.0.2 (THE LAST RELEASE)

    Highlight

   This release is essentially Tix 4.0.2 code with a much improved
   configure script. Many users experienced errors and confusions with
   the 4.0.2 configure/installation process. In 4.0.3, all options to the
   configure script can be set in the command line. This makes it
   possible to run configure directly without using the graphical "setup"
   program.

   The following is taken from the Changes.html file

    2/8/96

   Bug fix: Many setup/config/installation bugs have been fixed.

   Change: Now all options taken by the configure script can be specified
   in the command line to configure. This way setup and configure and be
   used inter-changeably.

   Change: Direct use of the configure script is no longer "strongly
   discouraged".

   Improvement: New resource *tixSchemePriority. You can add this into
   the .Xdefaults files to adjust the priority level of the options set
   by the Tix schemes. Please refer to the Tix.n man page.

  WHAT'S NEW SINCE TIX 4.0.1

    Highlights
    1. Works with Tk 4.1, Tcl 7.5 and ITcl 2.0
    2. Improved setup script
    3. New XPM image reader (no longer requires libXpm.a)

   The following is taken from the Changes.html file

    1/10/96

   Improvement: New methods forget and manage for PanedWindow.

    1/13/96

   Improvement: Now HList draws the background for its indicators. This
   makes it possible to use 1-bit bitmaps as indicators. Howeverm, now it
   is necessary to explicitly set the padding of the indicators to be
   zero by using Display Styles.

    1/15/96

   Bug fix: The scrolled widgets did not immediately honor requests like
   "$sw subwidget hsb config -height 10".

   Improvement: New XPM reader that does not require the libXpm.a
   library.

    1/16/96

   Bug fix: Now the tixMwm command does not require a patch to
   tkXEvent.c. The patched version of tkXEvent.c is removed from the src/
   directory.

    1/17/96

   Improvement: Major rearrangement of the configure script. Now it
   handles compilations with both tk 4.0 and 4.1. A description of the
   current configuration method and directory arrangement is in
   Install.html.

    1/18/96

   Bug fix: The "Foo" bindtag in Primitiv.tcl was changed to
   "TixDestroyHandler" to advoid namespace pollution.

    1/24/96

   New feature: New option -dynamicgeometry for NoteBook widget.

   New feature: Now the -scrollbar options for all the scrolled widgets
   can have the following extended format for "auto" :

    auto [+x] [-x] [+y] [-y]

   The +x, -x, etc are optional switches that specifies that the x (or y)
   scrollbar should always be shown (or hidden).

    1/26/96

   New feature: Now Init.tcl checks whether the version of the script
   library matches with the binary. Prints out error message if they
   don't match. Hopefully this will make it easier to detect bad
   installations.

    1/29/96

   New feature: Now Tix automatically configures itself to compile with
   Tk 4.0, 4.1, ITcl 2.0 and ET. Also, you can compile libtix.so for
   dynamic loading under Tcl 7.5/Tk4.0.

    1/30/96

   Improvement: Some changes to make Tix work with ITcl 2.0:
     * Tix widgets can now be put in ITcl mega-widgets.
     * A patched version of itcl_namesp.c can be found in the unix-itcl20
       directory.

   New feature: Now Tix comes with a small automatic test suite. You can
   type make test to test various features of Tix. More test programs
   will be added in the future.

    2/4/96

   Improvement: With ITCL, all Tix widget commands are evaluated in the
   global scope by default. This seems to be the only way for the Tix
   widgets to work within ITCL classes. See the test file
   test/itcl/scope1.tcl.

   Change: Now the installation of the main part of Tix (TCL script
   library and man pages) are handled by the toplevel Makefile.in. The
   installation of specific binaries are handled by
   unix-tk4.0/Makefile.in, unix-tk4.1/Makefile.in, etc.
