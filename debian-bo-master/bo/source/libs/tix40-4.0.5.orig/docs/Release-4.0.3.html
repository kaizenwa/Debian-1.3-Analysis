   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.0.3, the

   section below for changes since the last release.

     <li> Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ITcl 2.0

<h3>Getting The Tix Package</h3>

   You can obtain Tix from the following ftp site:

<pre>   ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.0.3.tar.gz </pre>

   I have also uploaded the file to the official Tcl site, so in a few
   days it will also be available at:

<h3>What's New Since Tix 4.0.2 (the last release)</h3>

<h4>Highlight</h4>

   
   This release is essentially Tix 4.0.2 code with a much improved
   configure script. Many users experienced errors and confusions with
   the 4.0.2 configure/installation process. In 4.0.3, all options to
   the configure script can be set in the command line. This makes it
   possible to run configure directly without using the graphical
   "setup" program. <p>

   The following is taken from the Changes.html file
   
<h4>2/8/96</h4>

  <b>Bug fix:</b> Many setup/config/installation bugs have been fixed.<p>

  <b>Change:</b> Now all options taken by the configure script can be
  specified in the command line to configure. This way setup and
  configure and be used inter-changeably. <p>

  <b>Change:</b> Direct use of the configure script is no longer
  "strongly discouraged". <p>
  
  <b>Improvement:</b> New resource *tixSchemePriority. You can add
  this into the .Xdefaults files to adjust the priority level of the
  options set by the Tix schemes. Please refer to the Tix.n man
  page.<p>

<h3>What's New Since Tix 4.0.1</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
   <ol>
     <li> Works with Tk 4.1, Tcl 7.5 and ITcl 2.0
     <li> Improved setup script
     <li> New XPM image reader (no longer requires libXpm.a)
   </ol>
   
   The following is taken from the Changes.html file
   
<h4>1/10/96</h4>

  <b>Improvement:</b> New methods <code>forget</code> and
  <code>manage</code> for PanedWindow. <p>

<h4>1/13/96</h4>

  <b>Improvement:</b> Now HList draws the background for its
  indicators. This makes it possible to use 1-bit bitmaps as
  indicators. Howeverm, now it is necessary to explicitly set the
  padding of the indicators to be zero by using Display Styles. <p>


<h4>1/15/96</h4>

  <b>Bug fix:</b> The scrolled widgets did not immediately honor
  requests like "<code>$sw subwidget hsb config -height 10</code>".<p>

  <b>Improvement:</b> New XPM reader that does not require the
  libXpm.a library. <p>

<h4>1/16/96</h4>

  <b>Bug fix:</b> Now the <code>tixMwm</code> command does not require
  a patch to <code>tkXEvent.c</code>. The patched version of
  <code>tkXEvent.c</code> is removed from the <code>src/</code>
  directory. <p>

<h4>1/17/96</h4>

  <b>Improvement:</b> Major rearrangement of the configure script. Now
  it handles compilations with both tk 4.0 and 4.1. A description of
  the current configuration method and directory arrangement is in
  Install.html.<p>

<h4>1/18/96</h4>

  <b>Bug fix:</b> The "Foo" bindtag in Primitiv.tcl was changed to
  "TixDestroyHandler" to advoid namespace pollution. <p>

<h4>1/24/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> New option <code>-dynamicgeometry</code> for
  NoteBook widget.<p>

  <b>New feature:</b> Now the -scrollbar options for all the scrolled
  widgets can have the following extended format for "auto" :

<pre>
    auto [+x] [-x] [+y] [-y]
</pre>

  The +x, -x, etc are optional switches that specifies that the x (or
  y) scrollbar should always be shown (or hidden). <p>

<h4>1/26/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> Now Init.tcl checks whether the version of the
  script library matches with the binary. Prints out error message if
  they don't match. Hopefully this will make it easier to detect bad
  installations.<p>

<h4>1/29/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> Now Tix automatically configures itself to
  compile with Tk 4.0, 4.1, ITcl 2.0 and ET. Also, you can compile
  libtix.so for dynamic loading under Tcl 7.5/Tk4.0. <p>

<h4>1/30/96</h4>

  <b>Improvement:</b> Some changes to make Tix work with ITcl 2.0:
  <ul>
    <li> Tix widgets can now be put in ITcl mega-widgets.
    <li> A patched version of <code>itcl_namesp.c</code> can be found
	 in the <code>unix-itcl20</code> directory.
  </ul> <p>

  <b>New feature:</b> Now Tix comes with a small automatic test
  suite. You can type make test to test various features of Tix. More
  test programs will be added in the future. <p>
  
<h4>2/4/96</h4>

  <b>Improvement:</b> With ITCL, all Tix widget commands are evaluated
  in the global scope by default. This seems to be the only way for
  the Tix widgets to work within ITCL classes. See the test file
  <code>test/itcl/scope1.tcl</code>.  <p>

  <b>Change:</b> Now the installation of the main part of Tix (TCL
  script library and man pages) are handled by the toplevel
  Makefile.in. The installation of specific binaries are handled by
  unix-tk4.0/Makefile.in, unix-tk4.1/Makefile.in, etc.<p>
