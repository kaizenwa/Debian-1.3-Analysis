  TIX 4.0

    Released on Nov 16, 1995

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.0 is available

   After almost a year of vigorous beta testing, I am pleased to announce
   the availability of Tix version 4.0. This is the final, official
   release version.

  REQUIREMENT

   TK 4.0 + TCL 7.4, with or without patches. It doesn't work with Tk
   4.1a* and Tcl 7.5a* yet. Tix 4.0 does not work with previous versions
   of TK and TCL. Versions of Tix that work with previous versions of TK
   and TCL can be found in the FTP directories listed below.

  GETTING THE TIX PACKAGE

   You can obtain Tix from my ftp site:
        ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/ioi/Tix4.0.tar.gz

   I have also uploaded the file to the official Tcl site, so in a few
   days it will also be available at:
        ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.README

  WHAT'S NEW

    What's New Since Tix 4.0b8 (the last beta release)
    1. Now the XPM library source code is bundled in Tix. The configure
       script has been changed to detect the existance of the XPM library
       on the target system. If XPM is not installed on the target
       system, the bundled XPM library will be used.
    2. The setup program now allows you to choose options.
    3. The Balloon widget is completely rewritten and now it should work
       under all circumstances.

    What's New Since Tix 3.6 (the last major release)
    1. Tix 4.0 works with TK 4.0 and TCL 7.4.
    2. Many new widgets have been added. Highlights are the Hierarchical
       Listbox widget and the NoteBook widget.
    3. It comes with a set of fully-indexed HTML documentation, including
       release notes, FAQ and man pages.
    4. XPM image types allows you to use the most popular color icon
       format in X Window.
    5. A compound image type allows you to display both text and images
       together in Tk buttons (and other widgets)
    6. An integrated demo program that shows all the useful features of
       Tix.
    7. A graphical setup program that makes Tix probably the most easily
       set-up programming library for X.
    8. The Tix Core is completely rewritten in C with enhanced
       efficiency.
    9. Many more .. please read the file docs/Changes.html in the Tix
       distribution.
