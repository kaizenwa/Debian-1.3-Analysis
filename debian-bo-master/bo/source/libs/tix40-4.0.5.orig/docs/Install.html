<h3><a name="requirements"></a>Requirements</h3>

  This <a href="../Version">version</a> of Tix can be compiled to run
  under several configurations on Unix platforms.

  <ul>

    <li> <b>Tcl 7.4/Tk4.0</b>: Requires the final release of Tcl 7.4
    and Tk 4.0 (with or without the p1, p2 and p3 patches).

    <li> <b>Tcl 7.5/Tk4.1</b>: Requires the final release of Tcl 7.5
    and Tk 4.1 (released on April 21, 1996). Does not work with the
    alpha or beta versions of Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1.

    <li> <b>ITcl 2.0</b>: Requires the final release of Tcl 7.4
    and Tk 4.0 and ITcl 2.0.
  </ul>

<h3>Installing <code>tixwish</code></h3>

    This release of Tix supports the GNU <b><code>autoconf</code></b>
    utility. It should compile and run with little or no effort on any
    UNIX-like system that approximates POSIX, BSD, or System V and
    runs the X Window System. I know that it runs on Sun (Solaris and
    SunOS) and SGI workstations and also works on Linux boxes. <p>

    Please follow steps when compiling and installing Tix:

<OL>
  <li>

       Make sure that this directory and the corresponding release of
       Tcl and Tk are both subdirectories of the same directory. In
       short, if you store the source distributions in the directory
       <code>/home/blah/src/</code>, then it should directory
       structure should look like this,:

       <blockquote><pre>
       /home/blah/src/tcl7.4/
       /home/blah/src/tk4.0/
       /home/blah/src/Tix4.0.5/
       </pre></blockquote>

       If you want to compile Tix with Tcl7.5/Tk 4.0, you should have
       these additional directories in your source tree:

       <blockquote><pre>
       /home/blah/src/tcl7.5/
       /home/blah/src/tk4.1/
       </pre></blockquote>

       If you want to compile Tix with ITcl 2.0, you should have
       the following directory in your source tree:

       <blockquote><pre>
       /home/blah/src/itcl2.0/
       </pre></blockquote>       

  <li>
       Run the Tix <code><b>setup</b></code> program to configure the
       Tix library. This program will allow you to choose various
       options such as which version(s) of Tcl/Tk you want to compile
       with, the location of the Tcl/Tk libraries, etc. To run the
       <code><b>setup</b></code> program, type
       "<code><b>./setup</b></code>" in the toplevel directory. This
       program is a GUI front-end for the GNU
       "<code><b>configure</b></code>" script. The set of available
       options are described in the the program. <p>

       Before running <b><code>setup</code></b>, make sure that you
       have the program <code><b>wish4.0</b></code> installed on your
       system (usually in
       <code><b>/usr/local/bin/wish4.0</b></code>). If not, you can
       start the <b><code>setup</code></b> program by typing

       <blockquote><pre>
       wish setup
       </pre></blockquote> 

       <p>

       Alternatively, you can use the GNU
       <code><b>configure</b></code> script to configure the Tix
       package. The set of available options can be found by doing the
       following:
       
       <blockquote><pre>
       cd Tix4.0.5/
       ./configure --help
       </pre></blockquote>       
  
  <li>

       After running <b><code>setup</code></b> or
       <code><b>configure</b></code>, you should get a set of
       <code><b>Makefile</b></code>'s. Now type
       "<code><b>make</b></code>" in the toplevel directory of Tix.

       This will create several executables, library archives and/or
       dynamic libraries for you, depending on the options you have
       chosen in while running <b><code>setup</code></b>:<p>

       <ul>
	 <li> <code><b>unix-tk4.0/libtix.a</b></code>:
	      library archive with Tcl 7.4/Tk 4.0.
	 <li> <code><b>unix-tk4.0/tixwish</b></code>:
	      executable with Tcl 7.4/Tk 4.0.
	 <li> <code><b>unix-tk4.1/libtix.a</b></code>:
	      library archive with Tcl 7.5/Tk 4.1.
	 <li> <code><b>unix-tk4.1/tixwish</b></code>:
	      executable with Tcl 7.5/Tk 4.1.
	 <li> <code><b>unix-tk4.1/libtix.so</b></code>:
	      (or some other name) dynamic library with Tcl 7.5/Tk 4.1.
	 <li> <code><b>unix-itcl2.0/libtix.a</b></code>:
	      library archive with ITcl 2.0/Tcl 7.4/Tk 4.0.
	 <li> <code><b>unix-itcl2.0/itixwish</b></code>:
	      executable with ITcl 2.0/Tcl 7.4/Tk 4.0.
       </ul>
       <p>

  <li>

       If <code><b>make</b></code> fails then you'll have to
       personalize the <code><b>Makefile</b></code>'s for your site or
       possibly modify the distribution in other ways.  First check
       the files <a href="FAQ.html">docs/FAQ.html</a> and <a
       href="Porting.html">docs/Porting.html</a> to see if there are
       hints for compiling on your system. If you need to modify
       <code><b>Makefile</b></code>'s, there are comments at the beginning of
       it that describe the things you might want to change and how to
       change them.<p>

  <li>
       If you are paranoid, these is a small set of test scripts that tests
       the behavior of Tix under various configurations. You can type
       "<b><code>make test</code></b>" to run these tests. Hopefully it will
       report "<code>0 error(s) found</code>". <p>

  <li>
       
       Type "<b><code>make install</code></b>" to install Tix's
       binaries and script files in standard places. In the default
       configuration information will be installed in
       <code><b>/usr/local</b></code> so you'll need write permission
       on this directory. If you'd like to use a default installation
       directory, you can change the "<code><b>exec_prefix</b></code>"
       and "<code><b>prefix</b></code>" definitions in the
       <code><b>Makefile</b></code>'s.<p>

  <li>

       At this point you can play with Tcl by invoking the
       "<code><b>tixwish</b></code>" program and typing Tcl commands.
       However, if you haven't installed Tix then you'll first need to
       set your <code><b>TIX_LIBRARY</b></code> environment variable
       to hold the full path name of the
       "<b><code>Tix4.0.5/library</code></b>" subdirectory. You could
       try doing the following in the Unix C Shell or Bourne Shell
       <blockquote>

       <code>env TIX_LIBRARY=/PATH/TO/TIX/SOURCES/library ./tixwish</code>

       </blockquote> If you haven't installed Tcl and/or Tk then
       you'll need to set your <code><b>TCL_LIBRARY</b></code> and
       <code><b>TK_LIBRARY</b></code> environment variable as well
       (see the Tcl and Tk README files for information on this). <p>
       </ul> </ol>

  If you have trouble compiling Tix, I'd suggest looking at the files
  <a href="FAQ.html">docs/FAQ.html</a> and <a
  href="Porting.html">docs/Porting.html</a>. It contains information
  that people have sent me about changes they had to make to compile
  Tix in various environments.<p>

  I make no guarantees that this information is accurate, complete, or
  up-to-date, but you may find it useful. If you get Tix running on a
  new configuration and had to make non-trivial changes to do it, I'd
  be happy to receive new information to add to <a
  href="Porting.html">docs/Porting.html</a>. I'm also interested in
  hearing how to change the configuration setup so that Tix compiles
  on additional platforms "out of the box".

  If you have compiled and/or installed multiple versions of Tk and
  Tix on your machine, make sure you are compile tix with the correct
  version of the Tk header files. If you get a core dump as soon as
  you start tixwish, please refer to the <a href="FAQ.html#coredump1">
  FAQ </a>.
