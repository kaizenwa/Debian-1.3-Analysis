<h3>Tix 4.0.1</h3>
<i> Released on Jan 10, 1996</i> <p>

<pre>

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.0.1 is available

</pre>

   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.0.1, the
   first patched version of Tix 4.0. Please see the "<b>What's New</b>"
   section below for changes since the last release.

<h3>Requirement</h3>

   TK 4.0 + TCL 7.4, with or without patches. It doesn't work with Tk
   4.1a* and Tcl 7.5a* yet. Tix 4.0 does not work with previous
   versions of TK and TCL. Versions of Tix that work with previous
   versions of TK and TCL can be found in the FTP directories listed
   below.

<h3>Getting The Tix Package</h3>

   You can obtain Tix from the following ftp site:

<pre>   ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.0.1.tar.gz </pre>

   I have also uploaded the file to the official Tcl site, so in a few
   days it will also be available at:

<pre>	ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.1.README   </pre>

<h3>What's New Since Tix 4.0 (the last release)</h3>

<ol>
   <li>
	The HList widget now supports "indicators" (the plus and minus
	signs next to the entries), which can be used to collapse or
	expand entries.<p>

   <li>
	The HList widget now supports headers.<p>

   <li>
	New widget "TixTree" can be used to display general
	hierachical data structures.<p>

   <li>

	The <code>et/</code> subdirectory is better organized. The
	file <code>etixAppInit.c</code> is much simplified and most
	the ugly stuff moved to <code>etixInit.c</code>.  It should be
	easy to use to create new applications that uses both Tix and
	ET.<p>

   <li>
	New display item type: <code>image</code>. It is basically a
	stripped-down imagetext item.<p>

	
   <li>
	Miscellaneous bugs fixed.<p>

   <li> The Tix Home Page has been moved to a new site:
	<a href="http://www.xpi.com/tix">http://www.xpi.com/tix</a>.<p>
	
</ol>
