<h3>Tix 4.0</h3>
<i> Released on Nov 16, 1995</i> <p>

<pre>

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.0 is available

</pre>

   After almost a year of vigorous beta testing, I am pleased to
   announce the availability of Tix version 4.0. This is the final,
   official release version.

<h3>Requirement</h3>

   TK 4.0 + TCL 7.4, with or without patches. It doesn't work with Tk
   4.1a* and Tcl 7.5a* yet. Tix 4.0 does not work with previous
   versions of TK and TCL. Versions of Tix that work with previous
   versions of TK and TCL can be found in the FTP directories listed
   below.

<h3>Getting The Tix Package</h3>

   You can obtain Tix from my ftp site:

<pre>	ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/ioi/Tix4.0.tar.gz   </pre>

   I have also uploaded the file to the official Tcl site, so in a few
   days it will also be available at:

<pre>	ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions/Tix4.0.README   </pre>

<h3>What's New</h3>

<h4>What's New Since Tix 4.0b8 (the last beta release)</h3>

<ol>
   <li>

	Now the XPM library source code is bundled in Tix.  The
	configure script has been changed to detect the existance of
	the XPM library on the target system. If XPM is not installed
	on the target system, the bundled XPM library will be used.

   <li>

	The setup program now allows you to choose options.
	
   <li>
	The Balloon widget is completely rewritten and now it should
	work under all circumstances.
</ol>

<h4>What's New Since Tix 3.6 (the last major release)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
       Tix 4.0 works with TK 4.0 and TCL 7.4.

  <li>

       Many new widgets have been added. Highlights are the
       Hierarchical Listbox widget and the NoteBook widget.
	
  <li>

       It comes with a set of fully-indexed HTML documentation,
       including release notes, FAQ and man pages.

  <li>
       XPM image types allows you to use the most popular color icon
       format in X Window.

  <li>
       A compound image type allows you to display both text and
       images together in Tk buttons (and other widgets)

  <li>

       An integrated demo program that shows all the useful features of Tix.

  <li>
       A graphical setup program that makes Tix probably the most
       easily set-up programming library for X.	

  <li>
       The Tix Core is completely rewritten in C with enhanced efficiency.

  <li>
       Many more .. please read the file <a
       href="Changes.html">docs/Changes.html</a> in the Tix
       distribution.
