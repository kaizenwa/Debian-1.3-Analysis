    Released on May 20, 1996

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.0.5 is available

   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.0.5, the
   fourth patched version of Tix 4.0. Please see the "What's New" section
   below for changes since the last release.

  REQUIREMENT

   Tix 4.0.5 works with the following combinations of Tcl/Tk/ITcl/ET:
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ITcl 2.0
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ET
     * Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 (a2, b1 or b2), supports dynamic loading.

  GETTING THE TIX PACKAGE

   You can obtain Tix from the following ftp site:
   ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.0.5.tar.gz

   I have also uploaded the file to the official Tcl site, so in a few
   days it will also be available at:

  WHAT'S NEW SINCE TIX 4.0.4 (THE LAST RELEASE)

    5/5/96

   New feature: New tool unix-et-tk4.0/makescript.tcl. It includes the
   Tix script library into a ET application in the correct order. If
   A.tcl depends on B.tcl, then B.tcl is loaded first.

    5/6/96

   New feature: Now the -default option of the Tix mega widget classes
   are inherited from their superclasses.

   New feature: New option -expand for the panes in PanedWindow

   Bug Fixed: ScrolledHList didn't calculate the size of the hlist
   subwidget correctly, resulting in scrollbars not appearing even if the
   hlist widget is not big enough to display all of its contents.

    5/8/96

   New feature: New method setsize for PanedWindow.

    5/10/96

   Bug Fixed: HList multiple and extended selectMode now work with
   TixTree.

    5/11/96

   Bug Fixed: HList "see" method sometimes doesn't display the specified
   element correctly.

   New feature: New option -postcmd for PopupMenu widget.
