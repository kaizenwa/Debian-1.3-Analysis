\section{Introduction}

This manual is a collection of the Tix manual pages. It describes in
detail all the widgets and procedures in version 4.0 of the Tix library.

\section{Note to Alpha Testers}

This is only an ``alpha version'' of the reference manual. Some of the
manual pages are not up-to-date. If you see a ``Tix 3.6'' heading in a
manula page, it is very likely this manual page is already outdated.
The pages with a ``Tix 4.0'' should be fairly up-to-date. If a feature
is mentioned in these newer manual pages but not present in the alpha
version of Tix you currently, it is probably because these features
have not be implemented.
