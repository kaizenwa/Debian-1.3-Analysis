LAPACK is a transportable library of Fortran 77 subroutines for
solving the most common problems in numerical linear algebra: systems
of linear equations, linear least squares problems, eigenvalue problems,
and singular value problems. It has been designed to be efficient
on a wide range of modern high-performance computers.

LAPACK is intended to be the successor to LINPACK and EISPACK.
It extends the functionality of these packages by including driver 
routines, iterative refinement and error bounds for linear systems, the 
capability for finding selected eigenvalues and invariant subspaces, and 
condition estimation for the eigenproblem.  LAPACK improves on the accuracy 
of standard algorithms for linear systems, for finding singular values and 
singular vectors of bidiagonal matrices, and for finding eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors of tridiagonal matrices.  The algorithms and software in the 
package have been restructured to achieve high efficiency on vector processors, 
high-performance ``superscalar'' workstations, and shared memory 
multiprocessors. In addition to the LAPACK routines, comprehensive 
testing and timing suite is provided along with the LAPACK software.

Version 2.0 of LAPACK introduces new routines and extends the functionality
of existing routines.  Prominent among the new routines are driver and
computational routines for the generalized nonsymmetric eigenproblem,
generalized linear least squares problems, the generalized singular value
decomposition, a generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, and
divide-and-conquer methods for symmetric eigenproblems.  Additional
computational routines include the generalized QR and RQ factorization
and reduction of a band matrix to bidiagonal form.

It is highly recommended that you obtain a copy of the Second Edition of the
LAPACK Users' Guide published by SIAM.  The Users' Guide gives an informal
introduction to the design of the algorithms and software, summarizes
the contents of the package, describes conventions used in the software
and documentation, and includes complete specifications for calling the
routines. 

The Second Edition of the LAPACK Users' Guide can be purchased from:
SIAM; 3600 University City Science Center; Philadelphia, PA 19104-2688;
215-382-9800, FAX 215-386-7999.  It will also be available from
booksellers.  The Guide costs $22.80 for SIAM members, and $28.50 for
non-members.  Please specify order code OT46 when ordering.  To order
by email, send email to service@siam.org, or via the World Wide Web
at http://www.siam.org.

The LAPACK routines are available from netlib for users who require only 
selected pieces of the package.
For a description of the contents of LAPACK, send email to
netlib@ornl.gov, and in the mail message type: send index from lapack.
A set of working notes are available from netlib as well and details
can be found in the index to LAPACK.

The complete LAPACK package can be obtained on magnetic media from NAG for a
nominal handling charge. For further details, contact NAG at one of these

developmental support from NAG Ltd., Cray Research, and many friends
and colleagues around the world.
