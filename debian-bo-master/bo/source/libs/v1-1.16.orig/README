******************* LATEST NEWS ABOUT V ***********************
-----------------
January 20, 1997

Release V 1.16 has a few bug fixes, mostly minor. The main
difference is a completely new set of Makefiles used to build
V. There are also several bug fixes, including one that is
very important for using Microsoft VC++.

-----------------
November 14, 1996

Release of V Version 1.15 has some non-backward compatible
changes. In previous versions of V, there were inconsistencies in
the order of width and height parameters. These have all been now
changed to consistently use a width/height order. (Except for
vIcon, which still use height/width.) The decision to fix this
order came from a general consensus of the V mail list.


You will need to change your code to reflect the new changes.
The following things must be changed:

1. Any calls to the constructor of a base or derived vCmdWindow
will need the width and height order swapped.

2. Calls or overrides of vApp::NewAppWin need the
order of width and height swapped.

3. Calls to vCanvasPane::SetHeightWidth(h,w) need to be
changed to vCanvasPane::SetWidthHeight(w,h).

4. Calls or overrides of all versions of Redraw(x,y,h,w)
need to be changed to Redraw(x,y,w,h).

5. Calls or overrides of all versions of Resize(h,w)
need to be changed to Resize(w,h). (The vTextCanvas
row/column versions retain their row/column order.)

Also, the makefiles have been revised for more flexible
building on different *nix platforms. Specific support
for Linux and Linux ELF shared files has been added.

A new method, vDialog::DialogDisplayed has been added to
allow dynamic setting of dialog control values.

-----------------
October 6, 1996

Release of V Version 1.14. This release has a significant new
feature, the long awaited text editor canvas. This is a very
complete text editor. There are also several bug fixes,
and OpenGL support for X.

-----------------
September 9, 1996

Release of V Version 1.13. This release has some significant new
features, as well as two bug fixes that can affect how previous
versions of V applications behave. The most significant new
feature is the inclusion of VGEN, the automatic V application
generator. The new program is described in the reference manual.
Scroll bars on the X version did not generate the proper values
for the top position, and have been changed to work as described
in the manual. vCanvasPane::DrawText on the Windows version has
been fixed to work the same as X and as described in the manual -
the position is the lower left corner.

There were other backward compatible changes. New functions for
supporting canvas scroll bars were added. You can specify exact
width of TextIn controls. CopyFromMemoryDC now allows subregions
to be copied. V now supports menuless/canvasless applications. A
new convention for specifying control IDs has been introduced.

You can now draw transparent text to a canvas, which draws the
text in the foreground color while preserving the existing
background.

This version also has an almost complete Motif version. IT DOES
NOT WORK!!! There are significant problems in the canvas
implementation, and redraw messages are not processed, so
this version is essentially useless. The Motif version should
be available for V 1.15.

Please see the Release Notes section of the user manual for
more details on the changes.

-----------------
July 12, 1996

Release of V Version 1.12. A bug in the Windows version was
discovered that was serious enough to warrant a bug release.
Version 1.10 broke lists and combos on command panes (but
not dialogs). Version 1.12 fixes this. I renumbered the X
version for consistency. Sorry about that!

-----------------
July 4, 1996

Release of V Version 1.11. This version has some bug fixes over
Version 1.10. It adds vApp::WorkSlice to allow continuous
computations to occur.

-----------------
May 29, 1996

The V Version 1.10 release includes the new V Icon Editor
application. It adds accelerator key support for menus.
It allows completely dynamic lists. Behavior of scrollbars
was changed in X to work like the Windows version.


-----------------
May 2, 1996

Release of V Version 1.09. This version adds C_ToggleButtons and
C_ToggleFrames (that allow Windows-like Tab controls).
There are also over 35 vIcons included for building tool bars.
The Windows version now has SDI as well as MDI support.

-----------------
April 18, 1996

Release of V Version 1.08. This version adds C_ToggleIconButtons
and ability to set the size of a canvas. It also is the first
release of the WIN32 version, and brings Windows and X versions
into sync.

-----------------
March 31, 1996

This release of V adds a memory drawing canvas, and new methods
for handling colors that make it possible to better use the
default color map.

-----------------
March 6, 1996

This is a major new release of the X version of V. V now has
a very nice 3D look. You can also use X resources to customize
the control color scheme used by V. This new 3D look still
used the Athena widget set that has been extended by customized
versions of several Xaw3d widgets. This new version is really
worth a look.

The Windows version remains at 1.05.

-----------------
February 28, 1996

Release V Version 1.05. Added some information files. This version
prepared for upload to sunsite.

-----------------
February 27, 1996

Release of V Version 1.04. The naming convention on the
distribution files changed to make it easier to tell versions
apart.

-----------------
February 22, 1996

Updated to X version 1.03. Cleans up some g++ incompatibilities.
Added Linux binary VDraw demo program to ftp directory.

-----------------
February 21, 1996

The Windows version has been updated to use static libraries.
The printer support is also now working.

-----------------
February 17, 1996

The v.tar and v.tar.gz files are updated to fix the compile
bugs in vfilesel.cxx and vstatusp.cxx. However, g++ 2.7.0 still
seems to generate a few warnings (in vpsdc.cxx) that can be
ignored. Support for an OS/2 version has been overwhelming,
and the OS/2 port has been moved to high priority -- but it
will still be summer at best.

-----------------
February 16, 1996

For the X version, the file "vfilesel.cxx" will not make with
g++ 2.7.0 or later due to a change in C++ semantics. To fix,
move the declaration of ix on line 339 to outside the for loop.
This is also true for "vstatusp.cxx",  line 47  (int limit).
Sorry about that. These changes have NOT been made yet to
the tar distribution files.

Also, the vdraw.exe example for the Windows distribution needs
the Borland runtime .dll. I'll also try to fix that asap.

-----------------
February 14, 1996

Version 1.02 -

The X Windows version seems to be stable at this point.

I expect to update the Windows 3.1 version in a few
days. It currently does not have full printer support.

----------------
February 6, 1996

Version 1.01 -
New versions of v.tar.gz and v.tar were installed this date.
The versions for windows will be updated soon.

----------------
January 10, 1996

Version 1.0 posted.
