This is the release 0.01 of the X Windows version
of vBaseGLCanvasPane, a V canvas pane class to support
OpenGL.

It is simple to use, but has not been tested on any
non Silicon Graphics machines.

To use it, compile the V/OpenGL code, your code, and link it
all with the V library.

There are a couple of samples, the intersection geometric
planes, and the OpenGL dinosaur drawing taken from
sample code of Mark Kilgard. These are in the file
demos.tar. Untar this file to create appropriate
subdirectories here.

Probably the easiest way to generate your own OpenGL
app is to copy one of those canvases, and add your
own code.

I hope to have a Windows NT version of this code before
too long.

I'd appreciate any comments:

   if it works, or doesn't work
   what features it needs to make it more functional
   does it work with Mesa?
   does it work on Non-SGI machines?

Thanks,
