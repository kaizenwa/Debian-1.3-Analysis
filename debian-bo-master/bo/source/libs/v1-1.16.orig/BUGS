This file contains patches to V source code. This
BUG file was started with V version 1.06.

Updated August 14, 1996

--------------------------------------------------------
Problems with g++ 2.7.x compilers: some versions don't have the
include hierarchy set properly, and some V code doesn't compile.
Removing the [extern "C"] statements surrounding the X11 includes
in [v/includex/v/v_defs.h] seems to fix this. Some compiler
dependent #ifdefs that may solve this problem have been
added.

--------------------------------------------------------

The Postscript printer canvas treats DrawAttrText and DrawText
the same, and always draws the text with a vTransparent pen. It
also does not draw in the various fill patterns when drawing
shapes. These are not fatal problems, and result in output that
doesn't quite match the screen, but that is usually ok. You can
also easily program around these problems if they are important.
They existed for over 6 months before anyone noticed, so they
don't seem to be a real problem. Nevertheless, help from anyone
who knows PostScript well enough to fix these problems would be
welcome.
