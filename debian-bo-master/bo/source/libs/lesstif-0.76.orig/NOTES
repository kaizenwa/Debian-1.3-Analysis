</ul>
<h2>Release 0.76</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>  The clipboard has mostly been implemented, but it does still have
	a few problems.
  <li>  The implementation of XmScrolledWindow has been completely reworked.
	Results should be visible in
	<A HREF="http://www.in-berlin.de/User/bitrot">plan</A>
	and xdiff.
  <li>  There is a new #define, NONSTANDARD_EXTENSIONS.  This is not enabled
        by default.  If enabled, it will allow lesstif to transparently
        convert a string to a pixmap for resource converters (which many
        people feel Motif should have done a long time ago).  Thanks to
        Paul Williams for this patch.
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Release 0.75</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Public release.
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Release 0.71</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>XmRegion code is getting there. -- Chris
  <li>New List widget.  Thanks Blake and Jon!
  <li>The clients/uil directory is being reworked completely. You'll notice
     that all the C++ stuff is gone. Thanks Geoff.
  <li>Configure was extended so you can choose not to compile the testXm
     and/or testMrm directory trees. Use configure -help to find out more.
     Configure also recovers if testXm or testMrm are not there.  -- Danny
  <li>Default for the new options --with-testXm and --with-testMrm
     changed to *No* meaning tests only get compiled if you want them to.
     -- Danny
  <li>Traversal/Focus/Navigation has been completely reworked; They should
     function much better these days.  This change was fairly massive, so some
     things are surely broken.  Feedback requested. -- Mitch
  <li>XmFontList and XmString have new implementations; they should be more
     faithful to their Motif equivalents.
  <li>LessTif should also work on OS/2 now. Thanks Michael Solling and
	Christoph Jaeschke.
  <li>Rewrite of mwm.  It's much better behaved now, with most appearance
     resources and a good bit of the behavior resources supported.  Transients,
     when they go away, now give the focus back to their parents (which might
     help with the locking focus problem sometimes seen in fvwm). SYSTEM_MODAL
     dialog support is more or less in, but cascading system modals will not be
     well behaved.  The parser is much more friendly, and shouldn't have any
     problems with multiple menus.  Multiscreen support is in (although you
     can't specify resources for each screen, but global resources work fine).
     Most of the Motif oddities with window properties are supported, including
     run-time update of the properties, application defined window menus,
     f.send_msg, etc.  Dialogs for quitting, restarting, and toggling custom
     behavior are in (with some drawing problems, but they do work).  As always,
     feedback on what works and what doesn't is desired.  See the files
     clients/mwm/README and clients/mwm/Mwm for details. -- Mitch
  <li>Pulldown menus work a bit better. -- Peter
  <li>Many geometry management fixes (esp. in RowColumn). -- Danny
  <li>The debugSources resource was removed;
     only the environment variable is left in the code.
     <PRE>setenv DEBUGSOURCES Command.c:SelectionBox.c </PRE>
     should do the trick.
  <li> Dialog modality is partially implemented.  Thanks Harald.
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Release 0.50</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Option menus are now in (somewhat). -- Chris
  <li>Menu Gadget support is almost up to the
      level of Widgets.  Use it with caution,
      as it may lock your server.  Mosaic 2.7b2
      menu items are selectable now. -- Chris
  <li>Debugging info from LessTif can be enabled
      by setting environment variable DEBUGSOURCES
      or the equivalent resource to a list of
      the source files that you want to see info
      from. test2 -xrm "*debugSources: Command.c:SelectionBox.c"
	-- Danny
  <li>Quick and Dirty implementation of internationalisation
	(i18n) for TextField. Works on XFree86 3.1.2 on
	FreeBSD, and on HPUX with X11R5.  -- Danny
  <li>First cut at FastSubclassing.  Starting rework of
	GadgetCache objects to be more in line with Motif.
	SyntheticResources and Resolution Independence are
	in, but a bit shaky (maybe).  Many more import/export
	procs need to be written.  Both Chris and I are working
	on the BaseClass stuff -- quite a lot to do there.  More
	mwm improvements (should be more stable on more platforms
	now).  Need to work on "shields up" for modality and
	multiscreen support for it.  If you experience core dumps
	with mwm, check and see if you compiled the library -- on
	some platforms, modifying the library a running executable
	uses can cause this (Solaris, Linux), as they think it's
	pure code, and don't swap it.  The alternative is to link
	mwm statically.  Oh, and I got rid of those pesky warnings
	in LTEditres.c. -- Mitch
  <li>GeoUtils have (somewhat) been implemented.  They still need
	work, though. -- Mitch
  <li>Pulldown menu grabbing is in the works. It kinda works for
	Cascade button WIDGETS, not at all for gadgets yet.
	In the gadget case, it's #ifdef-fed out. In the widget
	case it is not.
	If your menus appear to freeze, pressing Escape usually
	helps. If it does not, please send me detailed info.
	-- Danny (u27113@kb.be)
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.36</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Initial version of Mwm is in.  It's a bit rough, so don't expect to
      much.
  <li>Menu dragging is sort of working better.  This only applies for widget,
      so menus that use gadgets (such as those in Mosaic) will not work.  This
      will change quickly, so be patient.
  <li>Initial TearOffButton stuff
  <li>Fixed bug in configure.in for NetBSD/FreeBSD using GNU make
  <li>Added support for linux-aout shared libaries.  Thanks JanJaap!
  <li>New Gadget Cache and ExtObj stuff.
  <li>Better (more in line) geometry management in the RowColumn
      widget, the PanedWindow, and the Frame.
  <li>Lots o changes in Form, MessageBox, BulletinBoard.
  <li>Rob McMullen's TextField widget has been folded into lesstif.
      Thanks Rob!
  <li>RepTypes are actually working now. How come nobody told me :)?
  <li>Drag and Drop is beginning to take shape.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.33</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Harald Albrecht has contributed implementations of the VirtKeys stuff,
      XmDisplay widget, and the first "official" Lesstif client - <code>xmbind</code>
  <li>The configuration management stuff should be working much better
      and more portably across all the supported architectures.
      For those of you with Free/Net BSD, you can now use BSD make to 
      build lesstif for your machine.  Check out the <code>INSTALL</code>
      file for more information on configuration.
  <li>Gadgets and Manager widgets now communicate in a much more
      Motif-like fashion (with the _XmDispatchGadgetInput function).
      Gadgets specify an event mask to tell their parent what events
      they're interested in.  Also, more gadget events are handled,
      like the enter/leave events.
  <li>The beginning of the default button handling in dialogs is in --
      in the <code>ParentProcess</code> stuff.
  <li>The list widget should be a little less problematic now.
  <li>Included John Richardson's patch for XmLabelWidget/Gadget.  Now
      label behavior is much better.
  <li>_XmDrawArrow (Mitch's baby :) is behaving itself better lately.
  <li>We're starting to go after some of the more underlying things,
      like the GeoUtils and Traversal stuff.  Don't expect miracles
      though.
  <li>Fixed some problems with the Fontlist stuff returning NULL.
  <li>Lot's more stuff that I've forgotten.  If I missed something you
      sent in, please resend it (after seeing if it wasn't fixed another
      way :)
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.3</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>The list widget is currently undergoing a reworking.  Please don't
      expect much, but I'm working on it.
  <li>ScrolledWindows are working better. Thanks
      Mitch.
  <li>Applied countless million patches :)  Some didn't make it in.  I'll try
      to get to those soon.
  <li><code>memcpy</code> and <code>memmove</code> are not
      used anymore.  We now include <code>Xfuncs.h</code> and
      use <code>bcopy</code>.  If your system has a better
      way of doing it, it's probably set in there.
  <li>Configuration system should be working better.
  <li><code>makedepend</code> is now used for generating
      dependencies.  If you don't have it, comment out the lines
      in libXm and libMrm that use it.  Lesstif will eventually
      be packaged with makedepend so that it'll build it if it
      can't find yours.
  <li>Scales and Scrollbars are basically done (we think)
      barring minor cosmetic changes. Thanks Mitch and Peter.
  <li>Default buttons are now drawn differently in
      bulletin boards (and subclasses).  They're not
      <em>correct</em>, but they're drawn differently.
  <li>Code for handling unspecified width/heights has been
      changed to check the request widget's width and height,
      and now it checks for 0, instead of XmUNSPECIFIED.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.2</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Updates for MessageBox/BulletinBoard
  <li>Fixed primitive widgets unhighlighting themselves.
  <li>Better scale/scrollbar widgets -- patches from Mitch.
  <li>Added _XmClearBorders.  This function should be used to erase shadows
      and highlights.  Primitives now call it to erase their highlights when
      their parent is not a manager.
  <li>Added default button shadows to PushButtonWidgets
  <li>Added shared library support for HPUX 9, IRIX, Linux (ELF only), 
      FreeBSD, NetBSD, DEC OSF/1, SunOS 4, Solaris 2, AIX3, DG/UX 5.  
      I want your input on the current scheme.  Does everybody like it?
      Thanks to Xiaokun Zhu for his help.
  <li>Fixed problems with missing \n\'s in Transltns.c
  <li>Fixed x_includes and x_libraries not being set on IRIX after 
      configuration
  <li>Moved to include'ing a template makefile for the tests.  Made their
      Makefiles much smaller.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.1</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Changed lesstif to use autoconf instead of imake
       This will hopefully make it easier to configure stuff
       for different platforms so that the globbing stuff
       works correctly.  Along with this change, however, is
       the new job of getting shared libraries built for each
       platform.  If you have an idea on how we should go about
       doing this, please let me (<a href="mailto:toshok@hungry.com">toshok@hungry.com</a>)
       know.
  <li>The glob stuff has changed to be in the same directory
       as the other libXm stuff, and the function names have
       changed to _Lesstif_glob, etc.  The filenames have also changed,
       to LTglob{.c,.h} and LTfnmatch{.c,.h}
  <li>From this release on, libXmu need not be linked in with
       lesstif.  This is because we now include the _XEditresCheckMessages
       function, calling it _LesstifEditresCheckMessages.  The relevant
       file is LTEditresCom.c.
  <li>This release contains lots of fixes to the form widget from Danny et al.,
       and a new AtomManager from Harald Albrecht, which is doubtlessly more
       efficient than the previous incarnation. Excellent work Harald!
  <li>Vendor shell now responsed to the XmNmwmDecorations and XmNmwmFunctions
       resources.  If you have mwm running, you can now specify programmatically
       the decorations and functions that toplevel shells have.  Neato.
  <li>From this release on, I'm now going to start using numeric release numbers,
       (0.1, 0.2, etc.) so that when shared libraries start working, we can
       have a direct correspondence between the distribution and the shared libraries.
  <li>The Label widget's insensitive GC is now properly created.
  <li>CascadeButtonGadgets now draw themselves in the proper color, and are properly
       highlighted by XmCascadeButtonHighlight.
  <li>The menu system doesn't grab you server anymore, so you can run programs that
       have menus without fear of locking you server.  Xt grabs are used, however, which
       is the way things should work (in part.  Server grabs are necessary, but I'll get
       to that once the toolkit grabs are functioning properly.)
  <li>Most of the correct Motif translations have been integrated into lesstif.  You'll probably 
       see lots of warning messages about lesstif not being able to find an action.  These
       will go away soon.
  <li>I hear we're going to be written up again in next month's Linux Journal.
       Great work guys!
</ul>

<h2>Release Sep12-1524</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Most widgets now have their correct motif translations.
      Not all the specified actions are present, but those
      will come along.
  <li>Pixmap top and bottom shadows are supported now, both
      for manager and primitive widgets.
  <li>The primitive widget in general is almost complete.  One gaping lack
      of functionality is the resolution independence offered by synthetic
      resources.
  <li>Better <code>set_values</code> methods for some widgets.
      They now don't do silly things, like checking the request
      against new...
  <li>More complete interaction between mwm and XmVendorShell, 
      including client decorations and functions (see the testXm/vendor 
      testcases)
  <li>Better <code>XmTranslateKey</code> (actually, it's still rather broken..)
  <li>Buttons now draw themselves better in menus (i.e., no highlight rectangles) -- <i>I think</i>...
  <li>Blinking cursors for XmTextField (<i>yay!</i>)
  <li>Updates and fixes to many, many things...
  <li>I'm holding off on putting in the autoconf stuff until I get it functioning
      properly, or at least better...
</ul>

<h2>Release Sep01-1407</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>PushButton now correctly catches the ButtonUp event
      when the pointer is moved out and back into the
      widget, as do the other button widgets, withough the
      in_window field.  Gadgets also handle this correctly
      now, through their parent's manager translations.
  <li>PushButtons now fill in their interior when fillOnArm
      is set to true.
  <li>ArrowButton gadgets now draw themselves correctly,
      not at (0,0).
  <li>Many more fixes to widget code to use the #define'd 
      access macros.
  <li>Pixmaps are drawn more correctly in label subclasses
      -- i.e., they're centered properly (well, one or two pixels
      off, but who's counting) when the widget is smaller than 
      the pixmap.
  <li>Form and MessageBox updates from Danny
  <li>Scale updates from Mitch
  <li>Fixed <b><i>NASTY</i></b> bug with some default procedures.
      The offending functions used XtDisplay() instead of XtDisplayOfObject() 
      -- they're supposed to work with both widgets and gadgets -- and these would
      cause SIGSEGV's on my box, except they would happen in between the call to 
      <code>class_part_initialize</code> and <code>initialize</code>.  Ugh..
      <i>Actually, I've fixed various places where XtDisplay() is used for
      gadgets, like in the SeparatorGadget and ToggleButtonGadget expose 
      routines...</i>
  <li>We're now using the translations supplied in the mot.trans file 
      (testXm/misc/mot.trans), generated by Mitch Miers, for most widgets.  I'll add
      the rest for the next release.  <i>Please nobody send me them as a patch,
      I'll enter them myself.</i>
  <li>Fixed bug in SeparatorG that was using the XmUNSPECIFIED for the direction that
      its oriented in (e.g., width = XmUNSPECIFIED when orientation = XmHORIZONTAL).
  <li>Gadget seem to be working with MessageBoxes now... Dialogs!  Yay!
  <li>The menu system is in need of some overhaul and much pencil and paper work.  The
      next release may not affect too much more than that (well, I won't be working on 
      much more than the menu system and traversal)
  <li>I have not yet had a chance to try out lesstif on DEC's public alpha machine.
      There were some problems with out of scope function prototypes causing memory
      alignment problems.  These are not fixed (to my knowledge) in this release.  I'll
      look into it for the next release.
  <li>I've cooked together a <code>configure</code> scheme for lesstif, which I'll be 
      patching into the source tree something this next week.  It will handle most of
      the system dependent things much better than the imake system we're using now.
  <li><em> Wow... A lot has changed :)</em>
</ul>





<h2>Release Aug23-2257</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Converted the primitive widgets to use the "correct" 
      preprocessor symbols (e.g., Prim_ShadowThickness(w), XtWidth(w), etc.)
      Actually, I got most of the way through this... Too much work for
      one night.  I'll finish up the rest for the next release.
  <li>Pervasive change from using <code>strdup</code>() to <code>XtNewString</code>(),
      and <code>Xt</code>{<code>Malloc,Calloc,Free,Realloc</code>}, instead
      of their C library counterparts.
  <li>Re-engineered the event handling of the PushButton widget.
      This removed the funky and unnecessary "in_window" instance
      variable.  The only problem appears when the select button is
      pressed inside the pushbutton, and then the pointer is moved
      outside the window and then back in -- the ButtonRelease event
      is not passed to the widget.  Moving the pointer outside the
      window and releasing, as well as clicking inside the window work,
      though.  This should be an easy, boneheaded fix, somewhere in
      the Arm action (I think).
  <li>Preliminary ImageCache and Pixmap cache, which (as far as I 
      can tell) works like Motif's.  The label pixmap code now uses 
      XCopyArea again, so you can get into problems with pixmaps of 
      different depths than the widget's window.  This behavior exists 
      in Motif as well, so it's not a Lesstif bug.  
  <li>Atom Manager now does client side caching of atoms.
  <li>New testcases for Xmos (contributed by Mitch Miers) and 
      for the ImageCache routines.  Hey, on my Indy, testXm/imagecache/test1
      looks <i>exactly</i> the same under Motif and lesstif.  There
      still some problems with traversal (like, it isn't there) and
      redrawing on expose events, but initially it looks <i>identical</i> :)
  <li>A new resource converter for XmFontList's is in, so you can specify
      fontlists in resource files.  <b>Note</b>:  I've only tried this for
      single entry fontlists, without tags.  More testing is necessary here..
</ul>

<h2>Release Aug14-1709</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Sheesh.  I was in a hurry this morning to get the new release out
      and got bit by RCS again.  I've modified my distribution script so
      that it now checks everything in before tarring it up.
  <li>Also, I've included the latest Shadow.c patch from Jeremy Allison.
      Thanks Jeremy!
</ul>

<h2>Release Aug14-1051</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>First off, I've moved back to school for the semester -- starts in two
      weeks.  Much of the work I did this summer on a linux box, displaying
      to an HP X terminal doesn't work now -- going from an HP735 to an Indy :(
      It seems to be focused mainly in the RowColumn widget.  I'll fix this
      for the next release, but for now, it seems to be pretty broken.
  <li>Included all the patches (I hope) sent to me since the last release,
      including those from the Pixel Police (tm) :)
  <li>TextFields and Text widgets should be working better thanks to Danny,
      Mitch, myself and others.  For one thing, nasty unterminated strings
      should not be present anymore.  Also, the handling of the initial size
      of text fields has been fixed.
  <li>The "input" resource on VendorShells is fixed so that LessTif programs
      will by default accept the keyboard focus.  Now you can actually type :)
  <li>Traversal is beginning to work.  For now, the behavior is limitted to
      that of EXCLUSIVE tab groups (meaning that the keys move you around in
      the order of child insertion, not by screen layout.  This should be
      easy to add, but it'll be dependant on the manager widget type (I think).
      For an example, check out testXm/textf/test2.c.  Run the program, hit
      the down arrow in the window, and hit return.  This should activate the
      XmNactivateCallback for the pushbutton widget. -- <i>(Actually, this
      seems to be another piece of code that broke with the move... Your
      mileage may vary.)</i>
  <li>ToggleButtons seem to be very nearly complete -- nice work guys!
</ul>

<h2>Release Aug07-1618</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>This release is nothing more than the Aug07-1158 release with
      all the gadget header files included.  I forgot to check them
      in to RCS, so they weren't included in the last distribution. -- <i>Chris</i>
</ul>

<h2>Release Aug07-1158</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Selection box, Message box, and File Selection Box
      updates from Danny Backx and Mitch Miers
  <li>The rest of the gadgets are in, thanks to Mitch Miers.
  <li>Event passing from XmManager to XmGadget is in now.
      The individual gadgets do not all take advantage of it,
      though.  Take a look at the initialize() and input_dispatch
      methods of the pushbuttongadget for an example how it 
      might work.
  <li>Integrated the scrollbar fixes contributed by
      Peter van Helden.
  <li>The virtual key bindings are working now.  To get
      keyboard input for some window managers (like fvwm,
      mwm seems to be ok), just set the resource "*.input"
      to True.  For example:  'test1 -xrm "*.input: True"'
      will work.  There is an example .motifbind file in 
      this distribution in "example.motifbind".  Just move
      that to ~/.motifbind, and those bindings should work,
      given that you're not running mwm, or you haven't 
      set the defaultVirtualBindings resource. 
  <li>The beginnings of keyboard traversal within manager
      widgets.  Actually, the code properly calls 
      XmProcessTraversal in most cases, but this function
      only prints out the argument at the moment.
  <li>Beginnings of synthetic resources for resolution
      independence.  Check out the syn_resources in Label.c
      for an example.
  <li>The whole menu/cascadebutton scheme should be a little
      more bug-free now.  
  <li>New XmCreateSimple* routines contributed by Mitch Miers.
  <li>The RowColumn layout for XmWORK_AREA (at least) is 
      broken for the moment.  I'll get to this next week.
  <li>I've taken the liberty of once again reorganizing the 
      test trees.  Now, each directory has in it files named
      "test1", "test2", etc.  When contributing test cases,
      which are desparately needed right now, focus on a 
      particular feature of the widget, and write a concise 
      test of that feature.
  <li>Hopefully I haven't missed anything.  Enjoy this new
      release -- The <i>LessTif</i> developers.
</ul>

<h2>Release Jul16-2340</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Many, many updates from Danny Backx (who seems to be the only one of
      us with much time this summer :)
  <li>Made ArrowButton descendant of Primitive, instead of Label.
  <li>Compilation should work now on SunOS 5.4 (no testing done though).
      I've built LessTif on a sparc 5 I've got access to at work, without
      a hitch.
  <li>Scale widget is in (<i>Finally<i>).  Actually, this should have been
      in for some time now, except I lost Paul's email that contained it.
      Thanks Paul.
  <li>FYI - LessTif was featured in the August issue of <i>Unix Review</i>
      Guess some people actually like the idea of a free Motif (nah... can't
      be :)
  <li><b>Administrativia</b> - Releases will now be made weekly, either
      sometime Sunday night or early Monday morning (depending on how much
      is going on at the time.)  I'll try to follow this religiously, but
      I may slip up every now and then (I'll have a really good excuse, 
      though.)
</ul>

<h2>Release Jul09-2314</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Too much to really speak of... sorry for the delay in the release.  I did not
      (and still don't) have reliable access to an X display for testing purposes.  This
      will change in the following week, but testing for this release is extremely 
      important.  Please email all bug reports to toshok@cs.uidaho.edu.  Thanks.
</ul>

<h2>Release May25-0249</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li><b>New</b> <code>_XmOS</code> functions, and stubs for the 
      internal <code>_XmString</code> functions, although there
      is no "internal" representation yet.
  <li>Updated instance variables for primitive widgets
  <li>Cleaned up the shadow drawing routines.
  <li>Making better use of ActionProcs.
  <li>Got Label Gadgets working finally -- others should move along soon.
  <li>Fixed default procs so they work with gadgets as well as widgets.
  <li>Menu stuff is working a little better now..
      still no traversal, but the MegaButton widget now works :)
  <li>Bernd Wiserner wins the award for most contributions in a single
      day.  He contributed a new suite of Imakefiles, which allow 
      shared libraries, as well as the XmUpdateDisplay function and
  <li>Fixed incorrect default size for separators.  Now menus look
      quite a bit better.
  <li>Did a lot of work with the label.  Now uses the TextRect 
      correctly (I hope).
  <li>Shouldn't see any more SIGSEGV's with pulldown menus.
  <li>The scrollbar, my bad habit, is now drawing better, but is
      still broken.
  <li>Fixed <b>many</b> problems.
  <li><i>Not all the bug reports for the last ROTD have been fixed
         yet, but I'm working on it :)</i>
<ul>
<h2>Release May10-0051</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Changed the test <code>Imakefile</code>s so that
      they don't build the Motif executables by default. 
  <li>Added Paul's shared library snippet to the Imakefiles
  <li>Restructure directories.  Hopefully, when the source
      starts getting really big, it'll be easier to find
      stuff this way.
  <li>Label and RowColumn <code>query_qeometry</code> method
      is working better.
  <li>Form widget is coming along (thanks Danny Backx!)
  <li>New version of the List widget (Thanks Jim!)
  <li>Basic <code>expose</code> method for TextFields.  When
      I get time, I'll probably hack up Matt's Text Widget to
      make the TextField, unless he beats me to it :)
</ul>

Release Apr25-0550
-----------------
<ul>
  <li><i>From Jim Hunt - </i> List Widget draws correctly, methods 95% written, actions started
  <li>Added most of the <code>XmColorProc</code> stuff.
  <li>New <code>XmAll.h</code> header <i> -- thanks Paul. </i>
  <li>New Text Widget, from Matt Crosby.
  <li>Moved functions around, and added new files, more in keeping
      with the OSF's source layout (from information gleened from
      <code>Xm/XmP.h</code>)
  <li>Public and Private Stubs for
    <ul>
        <li>The Pixmap stuff
        <li>Gadgets utilities
        <li>Traversal
        <li><code>XmCreateVaSimple</code>* calls
    </ul>
  <li>Big bug fix in <code>FontList.c</code> -- <code>XmFontListAppendEntry</code>
      thanks to all that reported it.
  <li>Currently XmScrolledWindowWidgets are broken.  They'll be fixed in the next
      ROTD (I hope :)
  <li>Most widget subclasses and programs compile now.  They are still in the
      hopelessly broken phase, but they <i>compile</i> :)
</ul>



Release Apr23-1256
-----------------
<ul>
  <li>Multiline and multifont labels now work.
  <li>Gadgets are there (well, they just <code>#include</code>
      the widget headers and <code>#define</code> some things).
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.uidaho.edu:8000/hungry/dist/phaser_chess_0.01.tar.gz">PhaserChess</a> 
      <b>actually</b> works now.  I actually made some
      small changes to the PhaserChess source to get it to work, but
      I started with an unadulterated tree a few days ago, and it 
      worked.
  <li>ScrolledWindows work now -- at least with the scrolling policy set to
      <code>XmAPPLICATION_DEFINED</code> and the scroll bar placement set to
      <code>XmBOTTOM_RIGHT</code>.
  <li>Harald Albrecht's ComboBox widget, which XWord makes use of, compiles now.
      It has problems running, since the list widget and text field widgets don't
      quite work yet, but this is a pretty big step, since it's a subclass of Motif 
      widgets.
  <li>XWord compiles now.  Don't take this news as more than it really is.  It 
      doesn't even come close to running.  But it will :)
</ul>

Release Apr20-0325
-----------------
<ul>
  <li>C++ safe header files (<code>extern "C" { .. }</code>).
  <li>Initial XmFormWidget work.  Should work if you only use XmATTACH_FORM or
      XmATTACH_WIDGET.  It uses an interative layout algorithm, so I
      assume it's much the same as OSF's (since I've seen errors about
      bailing out after 10000 iterations in some of my broken Motif code.) 
  <li>Labels are very nearly complete.  Paul Hoad contributed pixmap support for them,
      and I've just completed (I hope) the <code>set_values</code> method.  The actions
      need to be done, but that's about it.
  <li>Jim Hunt contributed a new version of the List widget.
  <li>VendorShells are actually working now, so the Virtual Binding and Traversal stuff 
      can now move forward, and some of the default resource procedures can be written
      now.
  <li>XmStrings (via <code>XmStringCreateLtoR</code> can now be used with multiple
      lines.
  <li>Menu fixes -- they're working better, but still not quite right (i.e. no pointer
      or keyboard grabs or traversal).
  <li>PhaserChess is actually playable now -- try it out.
</ul>
Release Apr10-1917
-----------------
<ul>
  <li>MenuBars are <i>very</i> close to working.  This includes the 
      CascadeButton stuff, MenuShell stuff, and the RowColumn stuff.
  <li>RowColumns in general work a lot better than before.  They actually make use
      of the RepType facilities now, so you can specify packing resources (for example)
      in resource files.
  <li>PhaserChess (another hungry product) compiles and links with LessTif
      now, but it still doesn't work properly yet -- there are problems in some
      of the <code>set_values</code> code and the Text widget isn't functioning
      properly yet.
  <li>Mosaic 2.5b4 very nearly compiles -- problems with gadgets not being there yet.
  <li>If you noticed from above, I've removed the line about not looking at
      the Motif headers.  This is do to the fact that, while trying to get Mosaic
      and moxftp to compile, I discovered that some people make frequent use of 
      private instance variables and undocumented Motif functions.  I've therefore
      changed most of the widgets (managers mostly) to use the Motif 1.2 naming 
      conventions.  The primitives will come along eventually.
</ul>
