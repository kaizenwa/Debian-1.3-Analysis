Why did I do this?  Mostly because I was suprised that lesstif didn't
compile with g++.  At this point, the library compiles but the results
aren't too useful. To be useful the header files need to be wrapped
with extern "C" {}.

To compile, I used gcc 2.7.2 and compiled with gcc -x c++.  It seems
to compile on both Digital UNIX V4.0 and Linux 2.0.x.  There are,
however, lots of warnings.

interesting C++ problems:

	o in various places we can see this:

		highlight ? (int)XmSHADOW_OUT : (int)XmNO_LINE)
          and
		PB_Armed(w) ? (int)XmSHADOW_OUT : (int)XmNO_LINE)

           Here we are comparing two enums from different enum definitions.
 	   I stuck (int) before them so the compiler will compare them.
	   Not exactly rocket science, but gets the job done.  I didn't
	   think it would be a good idea to modify the headers... :)

	o K+R-style function delarations aren't valid

	o C++ keywords like class and new aren't valid

	o function declarations should match their prototypes

	o type checking is stronger

	o header files should be wrapped in extern "C" {}
          (not quite finished yet)
