1.1:

Fri Jan 28 14:02:22 CST 1994 JLC

Added XmNdialogType resource so it will be almost drop in
replacement for xmMessageBoxWidget.

Started to add XPM support for icons. Works, but there is
not standard place for xpm's (that I know of).  Plus I should
clean up where it actually looks for them.  Because of this,
I don't install any of the icons, but it will look in
/usr/lib/X11/bitmaps and /usr/lib/X11/xpm.  Finally I'm still
looking for (or hoping to make) some good icons for the defaults.
Right now they are just the generic XPM plaid.xpm icon.

Fixed SmartMBT.c so that n is initialized when used.

1.2: fixed SmartMB.c checking pixmaps against null to pixmaps
checked against XmUNSPECIFIED_PIXMAP

	(fix provided by Jan Anderson, janne@torpa.se)


Turned <Xwri/SmartMBP.h>  into "SmartMBP.h".



Wed Sep 28 17:14:36 CDT 1994

Added XmNdialogPositioning resource to handle where dialog pops up at.

XmDIALOG_POSITIONING_LEAVE_ALONE: let the window manager do whatever
XmDIALOG_POSITIONING_INITIAL_CENTER: first time it pops up in the center
	of the screen, afterwards it pops up wherever it was left at
XmDIALOG_POSITIONING_ALWAYS_CENTER: always pops up in the center of
	the screen
XmDIALOG_POSITIONING_DEFAULT_AT_POINTER: positions the dialog up so that the
	default button is centered on the pointer
XmDIALOG_POSITIONING_CENTER_AT_POINTER: positions the dialog up so that the
	dialog is centered on the pointer

Sat Dec  3 16:55:09 CST 1994
