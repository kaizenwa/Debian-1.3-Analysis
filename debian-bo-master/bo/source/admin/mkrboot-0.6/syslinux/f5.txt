Ethernet Devices

If you have problems with your ethernet card not beeing detected or
the system hangs during the boot procedure you can help linux to correctly
detect your card. The generic form for the LILO prompt looks like:

        ether=irq,iobase[,param_1[,param_2,...param_8]]],name

The param_n parameters are optional. Some drivers use them to pass
things like DMA channel or shared memory address to the ethernet card.
There is normally no need to specify these parameters. The first
non-numeric argument is taken as the interface name (you can specify a
second ethernet card this way).

Example: If you want to force the system to detect an ethernet card
at IRQ 11 and I/O port 0x340 use

        ether=11,0x340,eth0

at the "boot: " prompt. If you want to autoprobe one of the values just
set it to zero.
