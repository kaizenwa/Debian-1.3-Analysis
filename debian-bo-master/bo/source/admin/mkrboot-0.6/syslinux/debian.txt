            Welcome to Debian Linux!

This is the Debian Linux Boot Disk. On most systems, you can go ahead
and press <ENTER> to begin installation. You will probably want to try doing
that before you try anything else. If you run into trouble, or if you already
have questions, press the function key <F1> for quick installation help.

WARNING: You should completely back up all of your hard disks before
     proceeding. The installation procedure can completely and
     irreversibly erase them! If you haven't made backups yet, remove the
     floppy from the disk drive and press <RESET> or <Control-Alt-Del>
     to get back to your old system.

Debian Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law. For copyright information, press <F5>.

Press <F1> for help, or <ENTER> to boot!
