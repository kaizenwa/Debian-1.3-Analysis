GETTING HELP

If you can't install the system, don't despair! The Debian team is ready to help
you! We are especially interested in hearing about installation problems,
because in general they don't happen to only _one_ person. We've either already
heard about your particular problem and can dispense a quick fix, or we would
like to hear about it and work through it with you, and the next user who
comes up with the same problem will profit from your experience!

If you have WWW access, you might want to first look at our Web page
http://www.debian.org

You can contact the Debian team via Internet, by joining the debian-users
e-mail list. To join, send an e-mail message to debian-user-REQUEST@pixar.com 
containing the word "subscribe". Then, send a message to debian-user@pixar.com
with a detailed explanation of your problem, including the text of any system
error messages that you think might be relevant to your problem. Your message
will be read by hundreds of Debian users, and someone will be sure to help.
