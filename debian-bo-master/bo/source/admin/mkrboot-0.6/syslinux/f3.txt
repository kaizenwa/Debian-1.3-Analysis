SPECIAL BOOT PARAMETERS

   On a few systems, you may need to specify a parameter at the `boot:'
prompt in order to boot the system. For example, Linux may not be able
to "autodetect" your hardware, and you will need to explicitly specify
its location or type for it to be recognized. The table below indicates
whether you need a parameter. If you do, enter `linux' followed by the
parameter from the table. For example, if your 3.5 inch floppy drive is
your second drive, and your first drive is a 5.25 inch one, you would type
"linux root=/dev/fd1" at the \`boot:' prompt.

HARDWARE                               PARAMETER TO SPECIFY
System with less than 4MB memory       load_ramdisk=0
3.5 inch floppy is second drive        root=/dev/fd1
IBM PS/1 or ValuePoint (IDE disk)      hd=<cylinders>,<heads>,<sectors>
IBM ThinkPad                           floppy=thinkpad
