Watchdog is a daemon that checks if your system is still working. If
programs in user space are not longer executed it will reboot the system.
However, it will not always work.

From the kernel:

This tool proved very useful for me, because I always run the latest kernel
and the latest libc release, but rely on the machine to be up and running
for email.

Note, that you have to enable the software watchdog driver in your kernel
for the program to be able to reboot the system. In particular you have to
use a fairly recent kernel, because the driver is pretty new (about 1.3.51+).
Also make sure you don't compile watchdog with a differemt timer margin than
the driver.
