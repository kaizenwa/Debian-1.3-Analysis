If you're on a Debian system, make -f debian/rules binary creates the
watchdog package. It's even easier if you use debmake, just call build.

In case you do not use Debian, consider switching to Debian :-)

Okay, if you want to install it manually:

1) Edit the Makefile, if you have to.

2) Run make install as root.

3) If you don't have the device execute 'mknod /dev/watchdog c 10 130' as
   root. This is done automatically by the post-installation script for
   Debian users. 

4) Edit your boot procedure to start /usr/sbin/watchdog at boot time. The
   Debian bootfile is included in rc.watchdog.

That's it.

Enjoy
