termcap-compat (1.1.0) frozen; urgency=low

  * Made package architecture-independent. (3721)
  * Converted to new packaging standards.
  * Upgraded /etc/termcap to version 9.13.15
  * Changed version numbering scheme slightly (no "-[1-9]" anymore)
    to make the source package work better with the new dpkg source format.
  * Closes all outstanding termcap bugs (836, 1803)
  * Modified description to make it clear that termcap-compat isn't meant
    to be used to compile program. Says to use ncurses' termcap emulation
    routines for programs that need termcap. (Using them is as simple as
    replacing -ltermcap by -lncurses in the makefile.)
