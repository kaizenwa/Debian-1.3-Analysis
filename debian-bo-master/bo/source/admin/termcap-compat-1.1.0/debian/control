Description: Compatibility package for termcap-based programs.
 The termcap-compat package provides the libtermcap.so.2 and /etc/termcap
 files which are required to run non-Debian, binary-only termcap-based
 programs. 
 .
 You do not need to install this package to run Debian-packaged programs
 since Debian GNU/Linux uses terminfo and not termcap. You need this
 package if a program fails to run with the following error message
  "...: can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'"
 or complains about a missing /etc/termcap file.
 .
 The termcap-compat package isn't meant to be used to compile programs
 therefore it doesn't provide all the necesary files for compilation. If you 
 want to compile a program that claims to need termcap, why not try 
 ncurses's termcap emulation instead? It's as simple as linking with ncurses 
 instead of libtermcap (i.e. replace the '-ltermcap' with '-lncurses' in 
 the makefile). Ncurses' termcap emulation routines translate terminfo entries 
 to termcap entries on the fly, so you don't even need an /etc/termcap file.
 .
 This package provides:
  libtermcap.so shared library, version 2.0.8
  termcap database, version 9.13.15
