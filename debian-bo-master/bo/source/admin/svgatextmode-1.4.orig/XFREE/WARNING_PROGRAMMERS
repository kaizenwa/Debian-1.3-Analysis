Just a nice warning:

	All code on and below this level  uses the XFREE ordering for the
	port commands. This means e.g. outb() now uses the syntax
	
			outb(port,data);
	
	instead of the Linux method, used in all code _above_ this level,
	which uses just the opposite of that.
	
	You have been warned. This has fooled me several times already, and
	many others with me.
	
	If you experience unexplained segmentation violations, that's where
	they'll come from.
