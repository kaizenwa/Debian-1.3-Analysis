This directory contains parts of the code from the XFREE3.1.2 sources.

The code is Copyrighted by their respective authors.



These parts will be used by SVGATextMode, in an attempt to suppport more
hardware in a quicker and more reliable way.

The pieces of code are put in directories as they are in the original XFREE
distribution, but with most of the path stripped away. 
If the original XFREE path would be

	xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/common_hw/I2061Aalt.c

Then I shortened it to just

	common_hw/I2061Aalt.c

Some files were deleted from the "common_hw" directory (they are of no use
to SVGATextMode):
   - ATTDac.c
   - BUSmemcpy.s
   - SlowBcopy.s
   - xf86_ClkPr.c
   - Imakefile
   
Finally, the file common_hw/IODelay.s has been renamed to
common_hw/IODelay.S (otherwise the compiler gets an indigestion)

The "include" directory contains a few include files needed by the XFREE
sources. They are just dummies to keep the compiler happy. They are by no
means valid replacements for the real X-header files!

The "patches" directory contains some patches against the standard XFREE 3.1.2 code:
ALL these patches have already been applied to the XFree code used here.

  1. "XFREE_ALPHA.patch" contains a few patches against the "clean" XFREE
     sources used by SVGATextMode to get them to work on the Alpa. The
     patches have already been run, the patch file is just here for your
     (and my) reference.

  2. ET4000_GenDAC.patch is a patch to make the S3 GenDAC code also work for
     the ICS5341 used on some ET4000W32p cards.

  3. ET4000W32p.patch : solves a problem with ET4000W32p PCI cards in
     XWindows, where the mouse cursor leaves garbage trailing until you
     switch to a text console and back to X. This patch can be used
     against either the XFREE-3.1.1-1 source tree, or, optionally,
     against the XFREE LinkKit.

  4. Cirrus_ClockChip.patch solves a problem with the original Cirrus
     Logic clock chip code, which gave unstable clocks at e.g. 58 MHz.
     
  5. ICD2061_et4000.patch adds support for the ET4000 cards with ICD2061
     clock chip. The Diamond Stealth 32 is such a card.

  6. ET6000pll.patch adds code needed for the new ET6000 chip.
  
  All these patches will be included in the next public release of the
  standard XFREE server (3.2, when it ever hits the streets).
