  or ...              
  
  If you already have a working Linux configuration, copy the 
  TextConfig file to X:\textconf, and just uncomment the path-
  related lines in there (FontPath, etc).
  
- copy stm.exe to any place you like, as long as you (or the PATH variable)
  can find it back.



  Warning: stm.exe must be executed while the current working directory
  is X:. E.g. if textconf is on d:\etc\textconf, then you must run
  stm.exe while on drive d:
  This is stupid, but I don't feel like spending time solving that
  little problem.


Don't forget to read the documentation in the "doc" directory.
