spawn_login:

       A small utility by Andries Brouwer (aeb@cwi.nl) (the author of the
       VT_RESIZE kernel routine!), that can spawn login consoles by pressing
       "ALT-<up_arrow>". Putting
       
               spawn_login &
       
       in your /etc/rc.local enabled it when linux boots. This allows you to
       have only 2 VT's active at boot-up time (just an example), and create
       new ones on the fly. They are automatically removed when logging out
       from that console.

       The real advantage of this is that VT_RESIZE will not get an "out of
       memory" so soon, since there will not be that many ACTIVE VT's (all
       non-spawned VT's are not active, and do not need resizing, and thus
       don't require memory when resizing the screen).

setcolor:

	is a simple test/demo I wrote, to be adapted later into a
        replacement for my current color-setting program. It speaks for
        itself.

        Note:
        It needs at least an 1.3.x kernel for the PIO_CMAP call. It will not
        compile, nor run on 1.2.13 or older kernels!
