This file describes the meaning and use of the files contained in
the source-distribution of this package.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[Source files are obviously _not_ available in the binary-only distribution]
[Also, some hacking tools have been left out of the binary distribution]


First, the "user servicable" files: the ones you need to use (change,
execute, read,...) when trying to get SVGATextMode running.

  In the main directory:

    * SVGATextMode     Of course. This is it. This program uses a config
                       file (/etc/TextConfig) to get some required
                       information, and starts changing your text modes. The
                       main program of the package.
                       
    * TextConfig       A sample config file for SVGATextMode. It must be in
                       the /etc directory, so SVGATextMode can find it. This
                       file contains information about the hardware you are
                       using (VGA card, monitor, ...), and about the text
                       modes you will be able to select. If this file does
                       not reflect YOUR hardware setup, don't expect
                       ANYTHING to work properly.
                       
    * HISTORY          Contains the changes from one version to another.
                       When upgrading from an older version of SVGATextMode,
                       READ THIS FIRST. Some things might have changed in a
                       way that would suddenly cause SVGATextMode to fail.
                       
    * README.FIRST     A word of warning: SVGATextMode is "dangerous" to use.
                       
    * INSTALL          How to install SVGATextMode. And how to recompile it.
                       Amongst other things, it tells you what must be
                       changed to the config file for your setup.
                       
                     
  In the doc directory: (which you should REALLY consult BEFORE trying this) 

    * SVGATextMode.man
      TextConfig.man
      grabmode.man     The manual files. Please read them. Using SVGATextMode
                       can be very frustrating if you don't know what you're
                       doing.

    * PROBLEMS         A VERY IMPORTANT FILE. Read this when you run into
                       trouble. It provides some valuable troubleshooting
                       hints.

    * README.ET4000    If you own an ET4000, read this.

    * README.ET4000.AltClockSelect    If you have one of those special
                                      ET4000's, that has a problem with the
                                      "normal" clock selection for ET4000's,
                                      this is for you.

    * SVGATextMode.lsm   Linux Software Map entry for SVGATextMode. 

    * monitor-timings.howto   An attempt at demystifying the monitor-timing
                              black magic. If you don't feel very
                              comfortable with all those numbers, if you
                              don't know what "kHz", "Mhz", Hz", "Horizontal
                              Sync", "vertical Refresh", and many more of
                              those cryptic secret passwords to a succesfull
                              monitor setup mean, this is for you!

    * setVGAreg.doc    docs for the hacher's tools "setVGAreg" and
                       "getVGAreg". Not very useful, and in fact rather
                       dangerous, if the blood in your head starts avoiding
                       your brain when somebody mentions "VGA registers".

    * setpalette.doc   Gues what...

    * vgaset.note      A note about strange behaviour of some versions of
                       vgaset.
                       
    * README.Alpha     is a small note for Linux/Alpha users who want to use
                       SVGATextMode (they can!)

    * screen-resizing.note    Some remarks on screen resizing, and the
                              problems you could run into.

    * set80.doc        Right.
    
    * creating_textmodes_from_scratch.HOWTO
                       Despite the cumbersome name (I happen to like long
                       filenames, Mr. Rubini ;-), this document could be
                       _very_ interesting for people with specific textmode
                       needs. The title says it all.


                   
                   
  Utility programs:

    * clockprobe       A neat little pixel clock probing program. It is
                       REALLY useful when trying to find out what's going
                       wrong. It measures the currently used pixel- or
                       dot-clock for the currently visible screen.
                       
    * grabmode         An extension to clockprobe: even MORE useful. It
                       grabs the complete text- or graphics mode you are
                       using, and outputs a TextConfig-compatible (or
                       XF86Config compatible) mode line. Also an EXTREMELY
                       useful tool to debug a failing text mode.
                       
    * setpalette       
      getpalette       Two little tools to change/get the 256 color palette entries.
      
    * set80            Re-programs the VGA card into 80x25 text mode.
                     

  in the "contrib" directory: see the "README" there for more information.
  It contains programs from other sources, which could, or could not, be
  used together with SVGATextMode.



Other files. Not needed for "using" SVGATextMode.   

  The sources, of course: *.c and *.h, and Makefile

  in the XFREE directory: some code from the XFREE sources, which is used by
  SVGATextMode, and some interface code between theirs and mine...


  
  
Some misc. files. No vitally important information in here.
Behind-the-scenes information, talkshow gossip, and more.
               
  * COPYING          Tells you what the conditions are for copying and/or
                     changing SVGATextMode. This is the standard GNU General
                     Public License file.
                     
  * CREDITS          All those who have contributed to the mess you have in
                     front of you.
                     
  * TODO             Don't try to read this. Compare it to a pile of Post-It
                     notes reminding me what to do when I run out of
                     ideas...
