/***
 *** probe.c
 ***
 *** Try to measure CURRENT pixel clock.
 *** Should work on ANY VGA card, since it only uses standard VGA registers
 ***
 *** - No need to disable interrupts to be able to measure!
 *** - Can give slightly inaccurate results on heavily loaded machines (but normally not VERY wrong)
 *** - Due to wraparound in the usec counter (wraps at 1000000 usec), heavily loaded machines could show
 ***   measurement "bins" at values _below_ one time the actual vertical sync interval.
 ***   Bins at a multiple are normal, since a task-switch could make the clock probe miss 
 ***   some (or many) V-interval events. If the probe is switched away for > 1 sec, the usec counter
 ***   has wrapped around, and so an actual value of 1013425 usec between two measurements
 ***   shows up at 13425 usec instead. This is the reason for the "glitches" in the measurements.
 ***
 *** There should even be a possibility to measure H-frequencies using input status 1 bit 0 (0x3DA, bit 0).

/*
 * The Clock probe. Given the hor. and vert. REAL TOTAL screen size, it returns the pixel clock in MHz
 * 
 * 'REAL' means you have to input the total screen width (which is read from VGA regs in CHARS)
 * multiplied by the font size (8 or 9).
 *
 * NOTE: this function ASSUMES it has the rights to read VGA register STATUS1 !
 *
 * Should work on ANY VGA card, since it only uses standard VGA registers
 *
 * - No need to disable interrupts to be able to measure! (the probe in the X-server does, because it doesn't use timers). 
 * - Can give slightly inaccurate results on heavily loaded machines (but normally not VERY wrong)
 * - Due to unexplained "glitches" in the vertical sync register, some timing attempts go wrong.
 *   this is detected in the program, and it tries again.
 *   Does anyone know WHY those glitches are there, and how to circumvent them?
 * - has the tendency to over-estimate the clock rate by about 0.1 MHz. No real clue why... (or is it just on MY machine?)
 *
 * There should even be a possibility to measure H-frequencies using input status 1 bit 0 (STATUS1, bit 0).
