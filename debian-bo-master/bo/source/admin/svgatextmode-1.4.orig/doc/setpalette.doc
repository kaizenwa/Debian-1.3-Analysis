         setpalette: palette set/get program
         ===================================
         
Another quick hack.

This allows you to set or get the current color palettes used in all
RAMDAC's. That should allow you to change all 16 colors normally used for
text mode display. A real necessity if you have a grayscale monitor.

The program allows you to change all 256 palette entries, although text mode
only uses 16. Just in case someone has a use for it.

There are other similar utilities around (like the ones in svgalib), so this
will be of little real use. But is was lying around somewhere picking up
dust...

The commands are used as follows:

  getpalette: version 1.4. (c) 1995,1996 Koen Gadeyne.
   Usage: ../getpalette [options] <color_index>

       Options: -n  Don't program VGA hardware
                -d  print debugging information
                -x  output palette values in hex instead of decimal
                -8  use 8-bit color definition (0..255) instead of 6-bit (0..63)
                -s  print the built-in standard VGA textmode palette.
                     this is the palette that will be programmed when running `setpalette -s'
                -h  print usage information

       color_index: index number in the palette look-up table (0..255).
                      or 'all' to show all 256 entries

  setpalette: version 1.4. (c) 1995,1996 Koen Gadeyne.
   Usage: ../setpalette [options]  color_index  <R> <G> <B>

       Options: -n  Don't program VGA hardware
                -d  print debugging information
                -x  input palette values in hex instead of decimal
                -8  use 8-bit color definition (0..255) instead of 6-bit (0..63)
                -s  load a standard VGA textmode palette.
                     this is not necessarily the default system startup palette.
                     (use `getpalette -s' to find out what palette this is
                -h  print usage information

       color_index: index number in the palette look-up table (0..255).
                    or '-' to use standard input
                      (Input format = '<index>: <R-value> <G-value> <B-value>')
       R, G, B : color intensity for Red, Green or Blue (0..63).


This should be clear enough. 


SPECIAL FEATURE:
----------------

A special feature (if you can call that a feature) is the possibility to use
the output of getpalette DIRECTLY as input of setpalette (with '-' as color
index, using standard input).

This opens new possibilities for power-users who want to use a script to
dynamically and selectively change text colors. 

It also allows you to redirect the output from getpalette to a file, and
then manually edit it, using it as new input for setpalette, e.g. for
setting custom colors when booting Linux. 

Examples: 

a simple "no-op" would be:

> getpalette all | setpalette -

This should change absolutely nothing (note the "should" ;-)

You could insert any sort of fancy processing into that pipeline, if you
like.
