         set80: a 80x25 mode setter
         ==========================
         
Set80 is a short resque program that attempts to reset your screen to a
80x25 mode, without the need for a TextConfig file.

It is very useful when you are setting up SVGATextMode, and something goes
wrong. If you can get set80 to run, there's a fair chance that you will get
your display back.


../set80: version 0.9. (c) 1995 Koen Gadeyne.

     Resets and resizes the console to 80x25 mode, with a 9x16 font.
     It is completely stand-alone (does not call other programs, no config file).

     Options: -d  print debugging messages
              -h  prints usage information
              -a  use alternate method: restore ALL standard VGA registers.



WARNING:
  This does not work on ALL VGA cards. Notably the ATI cards and maybe
  ET4000 as well will not restore the correct clock (the rest will be OK).
  In fact, any card that has EXTENDED the standard set of 2 clock selection
  bits with some more, instead of REPLACING them with a completely new set
  will suffer from the same problem.

Another note:

  the "-a" option restores ALL standard VGA registers. This is a far better
  and reliable way of restoring the text mode to 80x25 mode, BUT it's not
  perfect at all. Since it wants to be chipset-independent, it doesn't know
  how to get an SVGA card from SVGA back to VGA.
