Most problems with SVGATextMode are related to clock selection. If your
screen goes nuts, it means that SVGATextMode (or you!) made a mistake when
selecting a clock.

95% of SVGATextMode problems reported to me get the reply "TRY GRABMODE!"

Grabmode allows you to measure the pixel clock that is ACTUALLY used, not
the one SVGATextMode _thinks_ it uses.


Most problems like that are caused by two possible things:

1) SVGATextMode doesn't know how to program the clock on your VGA chip,
   because it is not (yet) supported.
   
2) You entered the wrong "clocks" line, or, worse even, you just used the
   example clocks line in the example TextConfig file, despite the numerous
   warnings allover the documentation not to do so.


Use it before you start complaining. It'll save you (and me) a lot of
trouble.
