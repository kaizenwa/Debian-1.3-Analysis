ClockProg
---------

This is an attempt to get ALL known chipsets in one program for use as a
"ClockProg" program (either in X or SVGATextMode).

This is useful for XFREE86, where some built-in clock chips (ICD2061a and
ICS9161) don't support text clock restoration. If you use a ClockProg, you
can make X restore the correct text mode clock again, so you CAN use
SVGATextMode together with X.

It also enables the low clocks needed for 320x200 modes in X, which X seems
to deny, despite the "divide-by-2" mode that all VGA's have. So now any
"normal" VGA card can always access e.g. the 12.5 MHz clock needed for
320x200 (DOOM!).

Also, because of the "divide by two" feature that X doesn't have, you
actually get access to twice as many pixel clocks as you get from X!
