The following people have influenced SVGATextMode in some way or another, or
have contributed to it in a major way. Don't be offended if you're not in,
just let me know if you think you've been wrongly omitted.


The entire Linux Developers' community:
    Without them, this program would be useless, since there would be no
    Linux...      Hip! Hip! ... Hop

Original idea: Wouter Gadeyne (Wouter.Gadeyne@p24.f1906.n291.z2.fidonet.org
    or gadeynew@sebb.bel.alcatel.be), who wrote the first program for the
    Cirrus Logic card, and it made me so jealous that I changed it to
    support S3 as well. He is also responsible for many tips on how to make
    the code more "C-like". And for constantly nagging about me not going to
    finish it up into something distributable. So I REALLY wanted to prove
    him wrong.

First Beta testers: (for ET4000 support and general features): Kris Coryn
    (kcoryn@texas.knooppunt.be) and Lieven Gesquiere
    (gesquiel@sebb.bel.alcatel.be). Seeing it run on my S3 made THEM so
    jealous that they wanted it for their ET4000 as well. They also allowed
    me to test it on their machines, with all the accompanying system
    shutdowns, reboots, filesystem checks, etc.).

Hardware: Kris 'McCore' Coryn provided an amazing amount of video cards for
    me to test. His continuous feedback has a big impact on the performance
    of SVGATextMode. 


Authors of programs used directly or indirectly in this package:

Greg Lehey, author of vgaset. He sent me a corrected version
    of vgaset, and allowed me to include it here.
    
Eugene Crosser & Andries Brouwer, authors of "setfont".

Andreas Beck, author of GGI, the "generic Graphics Interface", which should
    ultimately replace all the chipset code and converge X, svgalib and
    SVGATextMode, so they all use the SAME graphics drivers, with less
    cooperation problems.

Kenneth Albanowski, author of Ultra2Linux.  Also author of TONS of good
    suggestions, and many, many others. First Author of the DOS port of the
    mode grabbers "grabmode" and "scanmode" and the
    contrib/scripts/grepmodes script. And LONG, LONG mail conversations
    about, amongst other things: ET4000 Wizardry and The Ultimate Text Mode
    Chip.

Stephen Lee, who provided most of the knowledge (and code) to make the DOS
    port of SVGATextMode possible, and several other small topics. Not to
    mention he finally made my S3-805 work properly in svgalib :-) He also
    convinced me to use lex and yacc to parse the config file (he sent me
    the code upon which this parser is based). I'll never forgive him ;-)

The XFREE86 development team, from whom I used a lot of code and ideas for
    pixel clock selection. The clockchip code was copied verbatim from their
    sources.

David Mosberger-Tang, Linux/Alpha version (I never even thought about this
    possibility until he came up with patches...!). see doc/README.Alpha.

Finn Thoegersen, Author of vgadoc4b (and previous versions): a must-have VGA
    documentation library for all us VGA hackers.



And lots more good and useful suggestions from (in no significant order):

- most of the above

- Daniel Sills, patient and extensive Beta tester, beta site provider
  (ansc.une.edu.au:/pub/SVGATextMode), IBM RGB RAMDAC testing, some other
  VGA card testings,...)

- Peter Chang, Diamond Stealth 32 ICD2061 clock code, testing, debugging,
  WWW-based beta site provider at
  http://www.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk/~etzpc/stm.html

- Bob McCracken, extensive interrogation on correct blanking programming,
  and a lot of kernel and misc. information, and some of the programs in
  contrib, lots of Linux kernel info

- David M. Meyer

- Kenneth J. Hendrickson

- Piercarlo Grandi

- Roland Meier, ET4000W32 wizardry, and valuable help with
  doc/README.ET4000.AltClockSelect
  
- Warwick Allison, motivation!

- Alessandro Rubini, lots of help on console/terminal stuff (VT_RESIZE!),
  lots of good ideas, STM's first (surprise) public appearance in LJ, and
  what more...
  
- Reuben Sumner, obscure ATI problem fix, automatic resizing of active VT's,
  SUID terminal protection fix
  
- Jason Yanowitz, help in fixing the ICD2061 problem.
  
- Michael Chew

- Jean-Louis DEBERT, very thorough problem reporting on ICD2061 problem, and
  several other "features" (=bugs))
  
- Stefan Dalibor, W32p/ICS5341 testing
  
- Shawn McHorse, ATIMACH32 test/debug

- Michael Shields, the make_ram_free() function, which should reduce "out of
  memory" errors. Some more bug fixes)
  
- Ton Hospel, C-styling tips

- Keith Owens, small patch to sync-range check

- Ron Sommeling, many small improvements

- Klaus Weber (CIP 92), Headland/Video7 help

- Harm Hanemaaijer, Cirrus Logic clockchip problem

- Brian Springstead, S3 911 high-speed text mode problem - should now work
  from version 1.1

- cshamis@erinet.com, pointed me to the "noblink" package

- Diego Roversi, ALI (avance Logic) help

- Paul David Walker, made me include my silly font editor ;-)

- R.E. Wolff, more on STM memory problem

- Marco Mariani, extensive OAK087 beta testing

- Tom Verbeure, I borrowed his O'Reilly lex/yacc book, without which 
  the transition to the new parser would probably not have been possible.
  He also bought a 17" monitor because STM looked bad on a 12" ;-)

- Jan Doornaert, for making me look for a solution for the ICD2061a clock
  restoral problem, resulting in option "clockchip_x", and for testing it.

- Harald Koenig, serious grabmode suggestions (especially about alternative
  clock probing mechanisms for architectures without microsecond counters,
  which is a conditio sine qua non for using grabmode on non-Linux machines)
  This needs to be followed up some day.
  MSWindows Grabmode executable.

- Noel Cragg

- Joachim Groh, patch to enable the setting of the consoletranslation with
  setfont -u.

- Yung Hsu (MACH bugbix in 1.2)

- Marcus Crafter, IBM RGB RAMDAC testing and docs suggestions.

- Al Simcoe

- Joe Waters, S3 Trio problems.

- Kris Coryn
- Jean-Louis Debert

- Ulrich Dessauer
- John Bashaw
- Delman Lee
- Nicola Bernardelli


Also thanks to all those who sent me a birthday mail :-)

S3 Inc. sent me an S3-805 data book, and that really got me going. Thanks.

Infomagic deserves a big thank you for distributing their "Linux developers'
Resource" CDROM-set at a ridiculously affordable price. It is the best
alternative for those poor bastards who don't have direct Internet-access
(like me). They allow the "un-wired" part of the world to get their hands on
Linux, too! The Infomagic CD's are like a pocket-size FTP site.

And of course: BARCO, for providing me with an invaluable E-mail account.
It's been a rather busy one lately...
