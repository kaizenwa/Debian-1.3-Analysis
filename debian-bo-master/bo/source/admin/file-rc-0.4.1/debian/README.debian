The Debian Package file-rc
--------------------------

This was packaged from the original new-rc posted on debian-devel and
debian-admintool. I have modified it to work in a real system, and set
up the postinst scripts, to automate conversion to the file system. I have
also written a script to convert back from the file system to symlinks.
