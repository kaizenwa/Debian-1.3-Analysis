.TH DUNC 8 "Version 1.5" "Debian GNU/Linux"
.SH NAME
dunc \- configure a dial up networking client connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dunc
[no options yet]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dunc
is a 
.B dialog
based interactive, menu driven utility to help automate
setting up a dial up network connection.  It currently only handles
vanilla ppp connections with some hooks for manual configuration.  It
creates (by default) the directory
.IR $HOME/.dunc 
where it stores its options and chatfiles as well as
the actual script(s) to make the connection.  It keeps a control file in
.I $HOME/.duncrc
which is created the first time you run the program.  This stores the values
selected for the various prompts during program execution.

.B dunc
actually does a few things:  it creates a 
.B chat 
file (see chat(8)) to be used when calling
pppd, it creates an options file to be used on the pppd command line as well,
and it creates a script to be run any time, using these two previous files,
to make a ppp connection.

These files are designed to be used without this utlity.  The idea is to
use this utility to create a profile for connecting to an ISP, for example,
and then just use the 
.IR dialup_connect
script created in 
.IR $DUNC_DIR 
(
.I $HOME/.dunc
by default) to make a dial up network connection anytime after that.  During
program execution,
.B dunc
will prompt the user to set up the tty device.  This normally happens at
boot time, but if the user is on a minimal installation (i.e. only base), 
then he/she may not have a device configured.  This is the only time when
.B dunc
needs to be run by root.  It is up the the sysadmin of each system to decide
on whether or not users can establish dialup connections on their own and
that decision has nothing to do with this utility.  The script created does
not try to configure the tty device, so that must be done already if executing
it outside of a program run (which should be the usual case).

.SH BUILT IN DOCUMENTATION

There is a comprehensive tutorial on the utility and its components installed
in
.IR /usr/doc/dunc/*.tut
that is accessable from the menu system.  There is no context sensitive help
yet however.  These tutorial files are in plain text format, readable by the 
text widget in 
.B dialog.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables may be set to augment
.B dunc's
default behavior:
.TP
.B DACU_DIR
This is the base dirctory where the script, temporary files, and other related
files get written to.  The default is
.I $HOME/.dunc
.TP
.B DACU_RC
This is the control file that contains the state information between program
runs.  It defaults to
.I $HOME/.duncrc
.TP
.B EDITOR
This defines the editor called by
.B dunc
if manual editing is selected from a menu option.  The default is 
.B ae 
(see ae(1)).
Please note that if 
.B ae
is not installed, and this variable is not set, you will not
be able to manually edit files from within this utility
\-\- even if you have an editor installed!

.SH FILES
.TP
.B $DUNC_DIR/dialup_script
This is the script created that uses the options and chat files to establish
the dial up network connection.  It is a bourne shell style script \-\- ash 
compatable.
.TP
.B $DUNC_DIR/chatfile
This is the chatfile to be parsed for usage by the connect script.
.TP
.B /tmp/wchatfile
This is the parsed chat file actually used on the pppd command line.
.TP
.B $DUNC_DIR/options
This is the ppp options file fed to the pppd command line in the script.

.SH NOTES
.B dunc
creates temporary files in
.B $DUNC_DIR
during program execution and one in /tmp when the script gets executed.
It cleans up after all of these.  If you need error logging, redirect STD_ERR
on the command line to a file (a la 2>filename in bourne compatable shells).

.SH CAVEATS
.B dunc
does not take the files in 
.I /etc/ppp
into consideration.  This is not known to be a bad thing, its just the case.

.SH "TO DO"
This utility needs to be able to do PAP/CHAP style authentication out of the
box so that MS DUN servers can be connected to.  It should also perhaps be
fitted for such things as
.B diald
and
.B slip
at some point.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.B "built in documentation."
