This is a matter currently under review.  For now it is released under
the GPL as suggested by the debian project.  There is no warrenty of
any kind with this software.  My intention is to release this for free
use and redistribution.  I would like to find a copyright that lets
anybody do anything they want with it, provided they don't try to 
restrict others (including me) from doing the same.  Until that time,
the GPL distributed with the debian software is being used.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License with
your Debian GNU/Linux system, in /usr/doc/copyright/GPL, or with the
Debian GNU/Linux texinfo source package as the file COPYING.  If not,
