# The script passes an extended device address to 'ftl.opts' in the 
# ADDRESS variable, to retrieve device-specific configuration options.
# The address format is "scheme,socket,instance" where "scheme" is the
# current PCMCIA configuration scheme, "socket" is the socket number,
# and "instance" is used to number multiple partitions on a single
# card.
