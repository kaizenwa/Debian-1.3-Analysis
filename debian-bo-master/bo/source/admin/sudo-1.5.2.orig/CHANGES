CHANGES from sudo 1.2 (unofficial version)

01) sudo now works under hpux, aix, sunos, bsd43, ultrix, linux, osf and irix.

02) Files w/o the executable bit will be ignored if they are in your PATH.

03) If execv() fails, perror is called (which prints out an error based on
	errno) and sudo exits with -1.

04) Included in this shar should also be a version of getpass() derived from
	the bsd net-2 source which works on bsd, ultrix, hpux, aix, and irix
	at least.  The latter three unixes have what i consider to be a broken
	getpass() in that if /dev/tty can't be opened it doesn't just use stdin
	like bsd getpass().  This means you cannot do: rsh host "sudo command"
	and have it work if your ticket has expired.

05) The Makefile has changed significantly.  It now has defines for all
	supported architectures.

06) Changed MAXCOMMANDLENGTH from 48 bytes to MAXPATHLEN and included
	sys/param.h where appropriate.

07) Rewrote the code that expands links & paths.  It now works correctly.
	(rewrote find_path.c)

08) Added a define NEED_STRDUP so we don't conflict with the system's strdup(3)

09) Now does *not* pass LD_* environmental vars on to programs that get
	exec'd.  Also removes SHLIB_PATH for hpux and _RLD_* for dec osf.

10) Now searches current dir last if '.' or '' are in PATH.  Misses braindeath
    like './' but if that's in your path you deserve all the trojans you get.

11) Added in linux patches from drew + flex support.

12) Added insults back in from original sudo(8) (define USE_INSULTS).

13) visudo now uses EDITOR envar (from John_Rouillard@dl5000.bc.edu)

14) you can now specify a dir containing commands that a sudoer can do.
    (from John_Rouillard@dl5000.bc.edu)

15) Ported to Solaris 2.x (based on a port of sudo 1.1 done by UnixOps).

16) Took out setuid(0); setruid(uid); pairs that bracketed calls to
    update_timestamp() since they are unnecesary and setruid() is
    broken on systems without a setreuid(2) or setresuid(2) system call.
    (Ie: AIX and Solaris 2.x).

17) The bulk of sudo now runs with the caller's real uid.  Grep for
    be_root() to find the exceptions.

CHANGES from sudo 1.3

18) Added SECURE_PATH as suggested by russells@ccu1.auckland.ac.nz.

19) Reworked clean_envp() to modify environ (not envp) so we can use
    execvp() safely.

20) Now use execvp() instead of execve() so sudo /bin/kill works under
    broken solaris.  This also fixed sudo /etc/fastboot under stock
    4.3 BSD.  Basically, this means that any executable shell script that
    lacks a '#!/bin/sh' magic number will now work with sudo.  Personally
    I think that the broken scripts should be fixed rather than changing
    sudo, but vendors will be broken.  Sigh.

21) Added USE_EXECV define so you can make sudo use execv() if you
    want.  Using execvp() shouldn't be a problem since it is always
    handed a non-relative path that begins with '/' but some people
    may not trust execvp().

22) Log file lines will no longer get truncated.  Syslog entries that
    would overrun the syslog(3) line limit are continued on another entry.

23) When logging to a log file, long entries are indented to improve
    readability.

24) Whenever the umask is changed, it is changed back to what it was
    before.

25) Log file is written as mode 600 instead of 644

26) Umask that sudo runs with may now be specified.

27) There is now a "configure" script.

28) Sudo will use ultra fast crypt (ufc) if it finds it for systems w/o
    a real crypt(3) (non-US ConvexOs/Secure for instance).

29) _BSD_COMPAT is now defined for Irix.

30) The global variable uid is now initialized to -2 because I'm paranoid.

31) Native Solaris 2 port from Matthew.Stier@aisg.com

32) Now use sysconf(2) instead of getdtablesize(2) if it is available
    (see change #31).  Because of the the getdtablesize() emulation for
    hpux is no longer necesary.

33) Now only do a getcwd(3) or getwd(3) once and do it as the real user.
    Sudo should no longer complain that it can't get the cwd unless
    there is a real problem.

34) Changed some malloc'd globals of fixed length to be allocated from
    the stack instead as there was no win in allocating them from the
    heap.

35) Fixed AIX STATIC_FLAGS as per the AIX faq.

36) Added -V flag to sudo and visudo (for version)

37) Now treat EACCESS like EPERM when doing stat(2) in find_path.c

38) Added prototypes for sudo functions (via __P macro)

39) configure now uses uname(1) if it exists

40) gethostbyname(3) is now only called if you define FQDN.  There's really
    no reason to not trust gethostname(2) and this way if name service is
    hosed sudo isn't...

41) added -v (validate) flag to sudo to update a timestamp w/o running
    a command

42) now use tgetpass() (getpass with a timeout)

43) find_path() now uses realpath(3)

44) wrote versions of realpath(3) and getcwd(3) for those without

45) wrote tgetpass()--a getpass() that times out via select(2)

46) sudo now uses posix signals if available

47) Finally added ConvexOS C2 security support from
    "Peter A. Nikitser, Systems Software Support, QUT" <P.NIKITSER@qut.edu.au>

48) You can now #undef MAILER if you don't run sendmail or the equivalent.

49) AFS support from adamh@austin.ibm.com

50) If you define BOTH_LOGS in sudo.h you can log both via syslog(3) *ans*
    to a log file.

51) Added ultrix /etc/auth (enhanced security) support.

52) Sudo now will work with a 4.2BSD syslog (SunOS < 4 && ultrix).
    Personally, I'd say you are better off logging to a file if
    your syslog is this ancient.

53) Changed realpath(3) to sudo_realpath() since we need to do the
    chdir(2) with the invoking uid.  sudo_realpath() should be
    faster than vendor-supplied realpath(3)'s anyway...

54) No longer create a static binary on AIX since it reportedly
    causes problem on newer versions on AIX 3.x.

55) If sudo_realpath cannot chdir() back to cwd sudo will print
    and error and exit.  Previously it would either fail silently
    or print an incorrect error message.

56) Moved code to send error mail to be after the log message.
    From rouilj@cs.umb.edu.

57) Added SUDO_USER and SUDO_UID envars.  Suggested by John P. Rouillard
   (<rouilj@cs.umb.edu).

58) Added -k and -h options and rearranged some of the code to be
    more modular and less braindamaged.  This introduces the concept
    of "run modes" to sudo.

59) Fixed visudo and flex.  visudo now calls yyrestart() if you are using
    flex instead of lex.  From bostley@cs.colorado.edu.

60) Added a "cat page" for systems w/o nroff.

61) Fixed a bug whereby only the last directory specified in a Cmnd_Alias
    was checked.  Reported by "James R. Hendrick" <hendrick@ctron.com>.

62) All .{c,lex,yacc} files now include both sys/types.h and unistd.h so
    we are sure to get the typedef of uid_t.

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.1

63) Added preliminary support for DEC OSF/1 protected passwords
    (shadow passwords).

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.1pl1

64) More support for DEC OSF/1 protected passwords (shadow passwords).

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.1pl2

65) Fixed mail logging to include the username as it should have.

66) Added hostname to log message in error mail.

67) Added -l flag to sudo to list the allowed/forbidden commands.
    Suggested by matthew@gateway.bsis.com (Matthew Stier)

68) Fixed bison warnings for parse.yacc and visudo.yacc.
    Pointed out by alfie@dcs.warwick.ac.uk (Nick Holloway).

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.1pl3

69) Sudo will now exit with an error if the command to be run is > MAXPATHLEN.

70) Test in configure for termios support was insufficient.  It thought
    Nextstep 3.2 had termios just because it as termios.h (need to link
    with -posix for termios on NeXT's)

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.1pl4

71) First stab at Skey support.

72) Sudo now sets IFS to be SPACE, TAB, NEWLINE.

73) Sudo now sets the real and effective gid to root's group
    (based on passwd file).

74) Sudo now checks that the sudoers file is owned by a certain user
    and not readable or writable by anyone else.
    (based on a suggestion by Joerg Schumacher <schuma@ips.cs.tu-bs.de>)

75) Visudo now sets the owner on the new sudoers file based on #74

76) Sudo and visudo will now compile with byacc (Berkeley yacc).

77) If the rename(2) of stmp -> sudoers fails /bin/mv is executed before
    bailing.  Based on code from Case Larsen <clarsen@mh1.lbl.gov>.

78) User-level configuration is now done in options.h.

79) Moved all compatibility #defines to compat.h

80) Incorporated new parsing code from Chris Jepeway <jepeway@cs.utk.edu>.
    This is much better than the previous parser.

81) Rewrote visudo.c and tickled parse.yacc to work with it.  Visudo
    now gives you options if a parse error occurs rather than blindly
    dumping you back in the editor.

82) Took out all references to realpath since we are now checking based
    in inode and device (with Chris' new parser).  The upshot of this
    is that path matches are done safely and the symlink problem has
    gone away.

83) Fixed bison warnings from new parse.yacc.

84) Added a default case to parse.lex to error on unmatched tokens as Chris
    sugggested.

85) Converted configure.in and acsite.m4 to autoconf 2.1.

86) Added lsearch.c and search.h for os's w/o lsearch()/lfind().

87) Sudo now checks to see that the file it is executing is a regular file
    (was just checking the execute bit so dirs slipped through).
    Pointed out by Barb Dijker <barb@labyrinth.com>.

88) Fixed a problem on HP-UX trusted systems with getpwuid() returning "*"
    unless the real uid is 0.  Reported by Brian Cunnie (cunnie@nyc.hp.com).

89) configure now checks for size_t and ssize_t in unistd.h as well
    as sys/types.h.

90) configure now checks for egrep before actually using it.

91) configure now checks for a working void implementation (ie: void * as
    a generic pointer) and sets VOID to void or char accordingly.

92) Added support for SunOS 4.x C2 security (shadow passwords) from
    Kendall Libby (fubar@shore.net)

93) Changed all occurences of bzero() to memset() and bcopy() to
    memmove().

94) Fixed a bug in sudo.c.  If a user has no passwd entry sudo would
    dump core (writing to a garbage pointer).  Pointed out by
    Stephen Schaefer <sps@gateway.bsis.com>.

95) Worked around a bug in AIX's lex in parse.c.  AIX lex doesn't seem
    to handle {x,y} range notation correctly.  Bleah.

96) Sudo would not report a failed attempt if the user entered <return>
    at the 2nd password: prompt so someone trying to guess a password
    could just invoked sudo multiple times and try one passwd at a time.
    Reported by Jonathan Adams <jonathan@smada.com>.

97) Added User_Alias facility.

98) Rewrote most of the ip address / network support.  Now works on all
    systems sudo has currently been tested on.

99) Sudo now sets SUDO_COMMAND and SUDO_GID envariables in addition to
    SUDO_USER and SUDO_UID.

100) Added changes to configure.in for UnixWare.
     (from John Warburton <jwarb@SACBH.com.au>)

101) Merged in changes for Interactive Unix and RISCos.
     (from Andy Smith <abs@maunsell.co.uk>)

102) Added testsudoers (from Chris Jepeway <jepeway@cs.utk.edu>).

103) Added fix for parse.yacc to avoid the kludge I was doing.
     (from Chris Jepeway <jepeway@cs.utk.edu>)

104) Now remove the IFS envar if set instead of setting it to a "safe"
     value to avoid problems with make and others.

105) Added FAST_MATCH option to check basenames of sudo command and
     paths listed in sudoers file.  If the basename doesn't match
     then it is not a match.  If the basename matches, then do
     a stat to make sure it is a valid match.

106) Now only stat(2) cmnd once in path_matches() (in parse.c).  Sudo
     was stating cmnd for *every* attempted match.  Now the stat struct
     is cached (ie: the var is a static).

107) Signal handlers in visudo are now only installed after the stmp
     file is opened.  Previously, it was possible to erase an open
     stmp file by sending visudo a signal within a small window.

108) Added Goon Show insults from  Russell Street <r.street@auckland.ac.nz>.

109) Broke out the insults into separate include files (insults.h
     is the master and includes the appropriate one).

110) Now use getwd() instead of getcwd() and provide emulation for
     OS's w/o it.  This was done since some OS's with getwd()
     implement getcwd() via a pipe to pwd(1).  By emulating getwd()
     by calling getcwd() on OS's w/o getwd() we lose nothing since
     the compiler should optimize away the extra function call.

111) Added crypt() for DEC OSF/1 3.x enhanced security.
     From "Richard L Jackson Jr" <rjackson@osf1.gmu.edu>.

112) Added an option to run the command in the background (-b) as
     suggested by Jonathan Adams <jonathan@smada.com>

113) First stab at kerberos support.  I'm not really sure it is
     possible to do this in a sane manor.  Sigh.

114) Better kerberos support.  Had to use setreuid(2) but falls
     back on a kludge if that does not exist or is broken.

115) Added -p (password prompt) support.
     Suggested by "David W. Cooley" <dwcooley@COLBY.EDU>

116) Added partial implementation of -l (list) flag.
     This is probably as good as it will get until sudo:tng.

117) Added anti-spoofing code to tighten up a race condition
     where a user could run sudo some_link and then change
     where the link pointed after the old link had been
     validated but before the exec().

118) Now update timestamp file via utime() (and emulate via utimes()
     if necesary) to eliminate a small race.  Works with
     both POSIX utime() as well as old utime() in BSD <= 4.3.

119) Kerberos ticket file now lives in same dirs as sudo timestamp
     files (to avoid trouncing on normal ticket file) and is removed
     after validation.

120) Now log tty user is on as well as pwd in sudo logs.

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.2 BETA

121) Fixed a bug in the anti-spoofing check.

122) Fixed up ISC support so that it works and looks like non-streams
     stuff in interfaces.c.

123) Now deal correctly with ip implementations that has an sa_len
     field in struct sockaddr.

124) Check ownership and permissions on timestamp dir and ignore if
     not owned by root and mode 0700.  Problem pointed out by Larry Auton
     <lda@research.AT&T.com> and Navjot Singh <singh@research.AT&T.com>.

125) Ignore timestamp files with preposterous dates to keep people from
     faking out sudo on OS's that allow you to give away files to root.
     Problem pointed out by Larry Auton <lda@research.AT&T.com> and
     Navjot Singh <singh@research.AT&T.com>.

126) A timeout of 0 will now cause a password to be entered every
     time.  Based on a suggestion by Larry Auton <lda@research.AT&T.com>
     and Navjot Singh <singh@research.AT&T.com>.

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.3 BETA

127) Cleaned up interfaces.c so that it is more readable.

128) Added support for syslog()'s that don't guarantee delivery
     of a message.  HP-UX is the only known offender.

129) No longer use memmove() since memcpy() does what we need and
     configure doesn't always catch memmove() even when it is
     there (may be a library problem).

130) Updated man page to reflect two more security issues.

131) Cleaned up shadow password support in check.c.  It should now
     be readable.

132) Added SCO support.

133) Added check to configure to find the max length of a uid_t
     in characters.

134) Removed uid2str() since we now know how big a uid_t/gid_t
     can be.  This elminates a few malloc()'s.

135) Added support for multiple insult types.  Based on code and
     a suggestion from Dieter Dworkin Muller <dworkin@village.org>.

136) Replaced clean_env() and rmenv() with a rewritten clean_env()
     that should be a little faster.  This also makes it easier to
     add to the list of "dangerous" envariables.

137) Added netgroup support.  Netgroups must start with a leading
     "+" to that sudo knows it is a netgroup.

138) Split out sudoers file format into its own man page.
     As suggested by Andy Smith <abs@maunsell.co.uk>.

139) Updated testsudoers.c to grok netgroups.

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.4 BETA

140) Added SecurID support from Giles Todd <giles@gt.demon.co.uk>.

141) Added -s flag to start a root shell and -- to signify end of args.

142) Sped up logging routines by replacing strncpy()'s with strcat()'s.
     This is safe because we dyanically allocate logline to be big enough.

143) Now support command line arguments in the sudoers file.

144) Sped up the loading on command line arguments.  This fixes the
     "commands with large argc's take forever to run" bug.

145) Expanded MAXCOMMANDLEN to 8K since we now have to deal with
     command line arguments.  Added bounds checking in fill() and
     append() so we don't drop core.
     XXX - 8k makes sudo *SLOW*

146) Added support in the lexer for "termination characters" to be
     escaped.  Ie: you can now use [\,:=] in command line args
     as long as you escape with a \.

147) Testsudoers can now deal with commands that have arguments.

148) If a file is not executable or not a regular file sudo will
     now give the appropriate error message instead of just
     "command not found" which is misleading.

149) Fixed a bug where if FQDN is set, load_interfaces() was never
     called.

150) tty is now a global so it can be used in the ticket file
     at a later date.

151) Strings in the parser are now allocated dynamically.  This results
     in a large speedup as compared to a 1K array on the stack. I
     have freed the strings in the parser where appropriate but that
     may not catch all instances.  Even so, the average sudo now
     takes up less memory than the 1K array version.

152) Fixed a bug in tgetpass() and configure that broke termio/termios
     support for some OS's.

153) Added cheapo implementation of tty-based timestamps.  The correct
     way is to have username be a directory with the tty tickets
     inside.  However, the current code does not take to that very
     well, and it does not allow the two systems to coexist. Therefore,
     instead of timestampdir/user/tty it is timestampdir/user.tty.

154) Added support for building in other than the source directory.
     Based on changes from "Simon J. Gerraty" <sjg@frodo.dn.itg.telecom.com.au>

155) options.h and pathnames.h are now included via angle brackets
     (<>) so as to use the -I include path.  This way, those using
     a shadow build tree may have local copies of these headers
     w/o clobbering the distribution ones.

156) EXEMPTGROUP is now a string (group name) and user_is_exempt()
     is now less of a hack.  It uses getgrnam(EXEMPTGROUP) to
     get a list of users in the exempted group.

157) --prefix and --exe_prefix are now honored in the Makefile.

158) Sudo will now behave reasonably in the case where the sudoers
     file location is mounted via NFS and the client does not
     have "root" NFS privs.

159) _PATH_SUDO_SUDOERS, _PATH_SUDO_STMP, and SUDOERS_OWNER are
     now set via the Makefile since that appears to be what
     most people expect...

160) Now include a pre-generated version of parse.lex since so many
     versions of lex are brain damaged.  If parse.lex is changed
     a new lex.yy.c will be generated.  The distribution copy is
     sudo-lex.yy.c.

161) Upgraded to GNU autoconf version 1.5.  There are now even
     *more* options.

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.5 BETA

162) Fixed S/Key support.

163) Cleaned up shadow password support further by moving much of
     it to getspwuid.c.

164) First cut at DCE support. [needs work to be functional]

165) New Digital UNIX C2 support based on code from
     "Randy M. Hayman" <haymanr@icefog.sois.alaska.edu>

166) S/key support now works with the generic bellcore s/key
     as well as the s/key from Wietse Venema's logdaemon.
     (Previously only worked with the logdaemon s/key).
     As an added bonus the s/key challenge is now embedded
     in the password prompt for a cleaner look.

167) lsearch.c will now compile on a strict ANSI C compiler.
     ANSI doesn't allow pointer arithmetic on a "void *"
     but gcc does.

168) Bought back latest HP-UX DCE support from Jeff Earickson
     <jaearick@colby.edu>.

169) configure now comletely groks $SUDO_LIBS and $VISUDO_LIBS.
     Plain old $LIBS is no longer used.  LDFLAGS has also been
     split up into $SUDO_LDFLAGS and $VISUDO_LDFLAGS.
     The reason for this is that sudo often needs extra libs
     for alternate authentication schemes but visudo rarely does.

170) The code to copy command arguments flaied for large values of
     argc due to realloc() lossage.  We now cheat and treat argv[]
     as a flat string (since that's what it is) and use pointer
     arithmetic to compute the length.  Kind of sneaky but it
     works (and is relatively fast).

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.6 BETA

171) Added support for UN*X groups in sudoers based on code from
     Dougal Scott <dwagon@aaii.oz.au>.

172) interfaces.c should work on ISC UN*X again.

173) All source files are <= 14 characters for old SYSV filesystems.

CHANGES from sudo 1.3.7 GAMMA

174) Minor configure[.in] fixes.

175) tgetpass.c now compiles on OS's that put the definition of
     fd_set in <sys/bsdtypes.h>

CHANGES from sudo 1.4

176) Command args in sudoers are now stored in an argument vector
     instead of a flat string to make wildcard matching simpler.

177) Added NewArgv and NewArgc that describe the command to be
     executed.  The copy of args in cmnd_args is no longer necesary
     and has been removed.

178) Using strcmp(3) for argument matching in command_matches()
     (was path_matches()) is no longer sufficient since we don't
     have a flat string.  compare_args() is used instead which
     calls either strcmp(3) or wildmat(3l) depending on whether
     there are shell-style meta chars (wildcards) present.

179) Shell-style wildcard matches are now available in the sudoers
     file.  Matches are done via Rich $alz's wildmat(3).
     This required the tweaks described in #176-178 as well as
     other, more minor, changes.

180) Commented out rule to build lex.yy.c from parse.lex since
     we ship with a pre-flex'd parser and can't rely on file
     dates being set correctly.

181) Fixed visudo and testsudoers to deal with new argument
     vector handling.

182) A null string ("") as shell in passwd file (or $SHELL) is
     now treated as the bourne shell.

183) Converted *.man to pod format for easy conversion to man,
     html, latex, and just plain text.  Tried to make the
     sudoers manual easier to read in the process.

184) Updated sample.sudoers and sudoers.pod to include info
     on wildcards.

CHANGES from sudo 1.4.1

185) compat.h now defines _PASSWD_LEN based on PASS_MAX if it
     is defined (from limits.h on SYSV).

186) Both short and long hostnames may now be used in the sudoers
     file if FQDN is defined.  From patches submitted by
     Michael Meskes <meskes@Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE>.

187) Now use skeylookup() instead of skeychallenge().  Hopefully
     this will work around a problem some people have reported
     on Solaris 2.5 with sudo and logdaemon 5.0's skey.

188) Now uses /var/run to hold timestamp files if it exists.  This
     is more secure.

189) configure now puts the timestamp dir in /var/run if it exists.
     Sugestion by Michael Meskes <meskes@Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE>.

190) Both short and long hostnames now exist even if FQDN is not set.
     This allows machines with fully qualified hostnames set via
     hostname(1) to use them in the sudoers file.

191) sudo was not honoring "." in $PATH due to a bug in find_path().

192) Added IGNORE_DOT_PATH option to ignore "." in $PATH.

193) tgetpass() now uses raw read(2) and write(2) instead of stdio.
     This should make it work on more OS's.  Previously, it used
     stdio (buffered) fgets(3) and fputs(3) with select(2) which
     may not be legal.  Also got rid of the nasty goto's and
     generally simplified the code.

194) Parser now supports hostnames like UPPERCASE.foo.com.  Previously,
     `UPPERCASE' was interpreted as an Alias.  This means that
     the `fqdn' stuff has been moved to the lexer (FQHOST is used
     to avoid collision with FQDN option).

195) Reworked --with-FOO in configure.in to support --without-FOO.
     Made shadow passwords the default for appropriate OS's.  They
     can be turned off with --without-C2.

196) Added NO_PASSWD option for those who don't want to be bothered
     by a password prompt from sudo.  This is really just a hack.

197) Added support for double quotes to mean "treat these words as one
     argument".  This is similar to what most shells do.

198) Added mkinstalldirs to make install destination dirs if
     they do not already exist.

CHANGES from sudo 1.4.2

199) Added support for --with-CC (which C compiler to use).

200) Added support for NOPASSWD token and running commands a
     specified users (sudo -u) from Keith Garry Boyce
     <garp@opustel.com>

201) Only link with -lshadow for Linux if libc lacks getspnam().  Problem
     pointed out by Michael Meskes <meskes@Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE>.

202) Replaced SUDOERS_OWNER with SUDOERS_UID and SUDOERS_GID.  Added
     SUDOERS_MODE and changed the default to 0440 (from 0400).
     It is now possible to NFS-mount sudoers without doing anything fancy.

202) If a runas list is specified, a user may only run commands as
     "root" if "root" is a member of the runas list.  The old behavior
     was to always allow commands to be run as root, even if a runas
     list was specified.  Now you can give someone "sudo -u operator"
     and not have the equivalent of "sudo -u root" as well.

203) Added "USER=%s" to logging functions.

204) configure will now add -lPW to (VI)?SUDO_LIBS if using bison
     or DCE and alloca(3) is not in libc (or provided by gcc) but
     is in libPW.a.

205) sudo would give an incorrect error message if the sudoers file
     didn't exist due to close() stomping errno if the open() failed.

206) Fixed "shell" mode (sudo -s).  When building NewArgv sudo was
     not allocating space for the NULL.

207) Added support for wildcards in the pathname.  Ie: /bin/*.

208) 'command ""' in sudoers now means no args allowed.

209) Added command line args to SUDO_COMMAND envariable.

210) HP-UX 10.x with C2 now uses bigcrypt().
     Changes from david_dill@Merck.Com (David Dill).

211) lsearch.c will now compile w/o compiler warnings.
     (Updated from NetBSD lsearch.c)

212) Now uses POSIX fnmatch(3) (which uses ! instead of ^ in ranges)

CHANGES from sudo 1.4.3

213) Now allows network/netmask in sudoers to override per-interface
     netmask.

214) Fixed -u support with multiple user lists on a line.

215) Fixed a core dump problem when built with -DSHELL_IF_NO_ARGS.

216) Fixed 2 typos in parse.yacc and removed some unnecesary if's.

217) Now always use install-sh since SunOS install can't do uid/gid's.
     Other BSD installs are probably similarly afflicted.

218) Fixed NFS-mounted sudoers file under solaris both uid *and* gid
     were being set to -2.  Now set uid to 1 to avoid group being
     remapped.

219) Now includes alloca.c (from gcc) for those w/o it.  Linking
     against -lPW breaks visudo on HP-UX and probably others.

220) Added --with-libpath, --with-libraries, --with-incpath options
     to configure.

221) configure now uses shicc instead of gcc on BSD/OS >= 2.0 to
     generate binaries linked with shared libs.

222) The parser was setting no_passwd even if there wasn't a
     runas match.  I reordered some things in parse.yacc
     to fix this.

223) `sudo -v' (validate) wasn't paying attention to NOPASSWD.
     Now it does.

224) testsudoers now groks "-u user".

225) Updated AFS support based on what tcsh 6.06 does.

226) Fixed a typo/thinko that broke BSD > 4.3reno wrt interfaces.c.

227) Hpux10 shadow password stuff now uses SecureWare routines.

228) SecureWare passwd checking now uses bigcrypt() if available.
     Now uses AUTH_MAX_PASSWD_LENGTH if defined.

229) configure now makes sure you don't have a config.cache file
     from another OS.

230) Added better shadow password detection.
     BSD >= 4.3reno -> /etc/master.passwd
     hpux9: getspwnam() -> /.secure/etc/passwd
     hpux10: getspnam() or getprpwnam() -> /tcb/files/auth/*/* (link with -lsec)
     SVR4: getspnam() -> /etc/shadow
     solaris: getspnam() -> /etc/shadow
     irix[56].x: getspnam() -> /etc/shadow
     sunos 4.x: getpwanam() -> /etc/security/passwd.adjunct
     DUNIX: getprpwnam() -> /tcb/files/auth/*/* (link with -lsecurity)
     SecureWare: getprpwnam() -> /tcb/files/auth/*/*
     ultrix 4.x: getauthuid() -> /etc/auth.{pag,dir}

231) '(' in command args no longer are a syntax error.

232) '!command' now works in the presence of a runas or NOPASSWD token.
     Simplified parse rules wrt runas and NOPASSWD (more consistent).

233) Command args and now compared as a flat string again.  This makes
     wildcard matches more consistent.

234) DUNIX C2 support now groks AUTH_CRYPT_OLDCRYPT and AUTH_CRYPT_C1CRYPT.

235) configure now uses config.{sub,guess} to guess OS type.
     Sudo should work out of the box on more OS's now.

236) Got rid of HAVE_C2_SECURITY, now just use SHADOW_TYPE.

237) Fixed race in tgetpass() where echo can be turned off and
     left off if sudo is used in a pipeline and a password is
     required.

CHANGES from sudo 1.4.4

238) `sudo -l' output now includes runas and NOPASSWD info and
     asks for a password unless NOPASSWD for ALL is set.

239) Sudo can now deal with all-caps user and host names.

240) Sudo will now remove the "ENV" and "BASH_ENV" envariables.
     From Michael Meskes <meskes@Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE>.

241) `sudo -l' will now expand Cmnd_Alias's (could be prettier).

242) `sudo -s' will now set $HOME to root's homedir (or that of
     the user specified -u) so dot files get sourced.

CHANGES from sudo 1.4.5

243) $HOME was always being set, not just with `-s'.

244) In visudo, the owner and group of the sudoers file were
     being set too early; an editor could change them and change
     the owner/group of the resulting sudoers file.

CHANGES from sudo 1.5

245) Added SHELL_SETS_HOME option.

246) Added NO_MESSAGE option.

247) Added %u and %h escapes in PASSPROMPT to expand to user's name
     and host.

248) Added "SUDO_PROMPT" envariable.

249) Usernames may now begin with a digit.  Gross, but people do it.

Sudo 1.5.1 released.

250) Added `opie' support.

251) Added check to make sure fnmatch() really works.

252) Now use the prompt S/Key gives us instead of rolling our own.

253) Added -H flag from Danny Barron <dcbarro@nppd.com>.

254) Add SUDO_PS1 envariable support.

255) Attempt at sequent support.

Sudo 1.5.2 released.
