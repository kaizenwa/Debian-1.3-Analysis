INSTALLATION
------------

To compile this program you simply change to this directory  and type:

configure
make

The usual GNU rules apply for compilation from a different directory,
namely

configure --prefix=/local/gnu
make
make install

will configure the installation so that bin and lib directories
are placed relative to /local/gnu instead of the default /usr/local.
If you want to build from a different directory than the one
in which this file resides, you use:

/path/configure --srcdir=/path/to/the/directory/you/are/reading/now
make -f /path/to/the/directory/you/are/reading/now/Makefile

If you have a reasonably complete installation of one of the
supported operating systems, you should not have any problem
compiling the software.

I reply to all messages that are sent to me, but occasionally I get
messages which I cannot reply to because of errors in the
return address. If you don't receive a reply within a couple of
weeks, then you should assume that I was unable to do so.

INSTALLING A NEW VERSION / UPGRADING
------------------------------------

Cfengine does not compile any names based on your choice of
prefix into its code, so when you collect a new version, you
don't *have* to compile with the correct prefix and run
make install. It should be sufficient to do:

configure
make
cp src/cfengine DESTINATION
