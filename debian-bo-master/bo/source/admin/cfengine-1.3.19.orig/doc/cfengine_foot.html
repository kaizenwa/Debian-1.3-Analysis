<P>If anyone knows anything about windows NT I would like
to know if it is feasible to port cfengine to this platform.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="cfengine.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>This unique naming scheme was suggested to me originally by
Knut Borge at USIT of the University of Oslo.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="cfengine.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>Note:
if the filesystem was in the fstab but not actually mounted a warning is
issued telling you that the filesystem was probably not exported
correctly on host1.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="cfengine.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>One
possibility is that an NFS filesystem cannot be mounted because the host
serving the filesystem is out of service.  If this is the case then a
subsequent re-run when the server resumes normal service will succeed.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="cfengine.html#DOCF5">(5)</A></H3>
<P>On
some systems, core dumps cannot be switched off!
<H3><A NAME="FOOT6" HREF="cfengine.html#DOCF6">(6)</A></H3>
<P>The Apollo DOMAIN OS does not seem to respect the NFS `nobody' protocol
for NFS mounted filesystems and all mounted filesystems have root access.
The usual tests for device boundaries do not therefore work on systems
which mount DOMAIN filesystems.
