In this directory, I'll put some examples for the /etc/menu-methods scripts.
Sorry, but at the moment I've only got fvwm and fvwm2 working, and
I'm hoping the maintianers of the window managers like to convert
their own menu-methods. If you need any help, write to me and I'll 
convert your menu-method for you (I've been working too long on
menu-1.0 now, I want to release it!).


For more info on the menu-methods themseves, read /usr/doc/menu/README.


***************************
The 9wm window manager:
   If you want to get the debian menus, you should type
   
     /etc/X11/9wm/system.9wmrc --start /Debian
   
   and the menu's will appear in the 9wm menu (mouse 3).
   
   Also, if you, for example, select Apps/Games/Puzzles/xtriangles,
   then, appart from MainMenu, you'll also have an entry for
   Apps, Games and Puzzles in your 9wm menu. I don't know 
   how to fix this (or if it should be "fixed").
