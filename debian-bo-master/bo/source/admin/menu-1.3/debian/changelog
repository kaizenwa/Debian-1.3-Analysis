menu (1.3-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low	
  * couple of simple bug-fixes. All not very serious, but would
    like this to go into frozen anyway.
  * fixed menuentry(5) manual page (was simply wrong)
  * made the default install messages somewhat nicer (in order not
    to scare away newbies)
  * Redirected stderr of the killall command in postinst to /dev/null
  * fixed typos in extended description (in control file).

menu (1.3-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Only change: added ifeq(), ifneq(), ifeqelse(), ifroot() to install-menu
    (and the README).
  * Added a "killall update-menus" to postinst (to prevent problems if
    update-menus is upgraded along with other packages that use it).

menu (1.2-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Another two-line-fix to update-menus, fixing the compat mode code.
    (if no icon was defined, that resulted in errors for the compat mode).
  * I would like this release to go into frozen, as it does
    fix a long-standing bug (still present in frozen), and will
    improve many people's experience with the menu's after isntalling
    some "unstable" packages (some of which may need the new menu
    functionality).

menu (1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks, Andy Mortimer, for noticing I don't close the fd's. 
    doing that now.

 -- joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>  Sat, 3 May 1997 15:43:46 +0200

menu (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes to README (documents parent(), basename()).
  * Slichtly changed the dpkg-lockfile detection in update-menus,
    after a report from Andy Mortimer

 -- joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>  Sat, 3 May 1997 14:52:45 +0200

menu (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes to example dwww script (though Jim Pick has a much
    better one)
  * Fixes to install-menu, for submenu entries.
  * Fixes to update-menus, no core dup on malformed "?package(..)" in
    menuentry files.
  * extra functions replacewith(), prefix() (install-menu)
  * make hotkeys case-insensitive.
  * the genmenu=, prerun=, postrun= assignments can now contain
    substitutions just like the startmenu etc ones.
  * Added a "|| errno==EACCES" after the attempt to lock the dpkg lockfile
    to hopefully check for all possible errno valus fcntl creates.
  * changed the "your system is messed up badly" message to 
    something nicer (now it is "please help me track down 
    this problem I have")
  * update-menus only gives the "forking to backround" text when
    it didn't kill any other update-menus (so you'll only see it
    once in a multy-package install session).

menu (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a few more example-menumenthods (afterstep, ctwm, twm, fvwm,
    fvwm95, dwww). With dwww you now have descriptions of the packages
    in the http://rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl/dwww/menu.html page.
    (make that http://localhost/dwww/menu.html, after you've instaled it).
  * These new menu-methods are now better than the old ones, as they
    properly quote the title.
  * fixed a few bugs in install-menu that caused it to interpret
    ifnempty() and ifempty() the wrong way around (also ifelse,...).
  * fixed permissions in /usr/doc/examples/*
  * fixed a few "default" menuentries.

menu (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * complete remake, added a lot of functionality.
  * New features
     - support for long titles and descriptions,
     - much more flexible /etc/menu-methods files,
     - if dpkg is running, forks into background, to get rid of that
       "need to run update-menus twice" syndrome.
     - support for hotkeys
  * see /usr/doc/menu/BUGS for known limitations of this release.

menu (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * fix "#" bug (a # is only a comment if it follows a space or newline)
  * add an example to create a www page for packages providing
    "dwww" documentation
  
 -- joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>  Thu, 23 Jan 1997 22:27:30 +0100

menu (0.10) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Manpages by Joey Hess (now it's a real package!)
  * if user runs, and ~/.menu-methods exists, read the
    config files from there (and don't process /etc/menu-methods).
  * Add support for olvwm ("treewalk" attribute /etc/menumethods)
  * -f -stdio is now standard (options are ignored, and always passed on
    to /etc/menu-methods/*)
  * files in /etc/menu-methods with anything other than letters/figures/_-
    are silently ignored by update-menus
  * some speedup in install-fvwmgenmenu (not as much as I'd hoped).
  * added $d{var}, $s{var}, $b{var} variable substitutions
    (request from Joey Hess).
  * if getuid()!=0, also parse /etc/menus, /usr/lib/menus.
  * Moved Lockscreen and Savescreen to Screen/ in default menus

menu (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * "popup" bugfix
  * Don't read /etc/menu-methods/*.* files (with a dot in it, usually
    backup files from dpkg).
 -- joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>  Fri, 3 Jan 1997 14:31:15 +0100

menu (0.8) unstable; urgency=low
  * Fixing longstanding bug (one Joey reported loads of times)
    when update-menus is run from a postinst (from a previously
    uninstalled package), update-menus assumes this pacage is not installed.
    Fixed by looking at commandline of ppid, and checking for
    "bash /var/lib/dpkg/info/$package.postinst"
  * The fvwmgenmenu now has a more general compat mode that should
    supports all window-managers, without recompilation.
    For more robustness, this mode is incompatible with the old
    install-fvwm2menu programme, though (different/no cache files).
  * update-menus has a mode to pipe the menuentries through
    stdin of the menu-method installer programmes (-f --stdin option).
    This should make everything somewhat faster.
  * The old /etc/menu-methods/* config files may not work any more.
    (Although I tried fvwm95, and that still works).
    If your window manager doesn't have the debian menus any more, please
    copy the relevant files from /usr/doc/menu/examples to
    /etc/menu-methods, and run "update-menus -f".
  * removes couple of /usr/lib/menu/default files that now are in the packages
    themselves.
  * update-menus hands -f uption to menu-methods

menu (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added some 9wm support (now gwm is the only manager without support)
    (Although only the pdmenu and fvwm95 packages support it. The other
    window manager have support files in /usr/doc/menu/examples)
  * One bugfix in update-menus. 
  * Added a few shells. These are in the "/Apps/Shells" section, and
    therefore I had to rename "/Shells" to "/XShells". That OK with everybody?
  * fvwm/twm/9wm install-fvwmgen menu compat modes now use full id's
    for the submenu's (request from Joey)
  * install-fvwmgenmenu now replaces $%{icon} with %icon% if icon!="none"
    in the "supported" section in the config file. This is added
    to the example config files for install-fvwmgenmenu
  
 -- joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>  Fri, 13 Dec 1996 19:01:39 +0100

menu (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added example files for twm and afterstep window manager. (along with
    the already avaliable fvwm, fvwm2 example files).
  * Again, the "default" support for fvwm2 has been removed (version 0.5),
    as this should be in fvwm2. See /usr/doc/menu/examples/${wm} on how
    to add support.
  
 -- joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>  Sun, 8 Dec 1996 21:53:52 +0100

menu (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * do space-stripping for fvwm2 (should be in fvwm2 package, but never mind)

 -- joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>  Sun, 1 Dec 1996 13:54:10 +0100

menu (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * if the .updated-menus "cache" file has incorrect entries, update-menus
    could loop forever. Removed this bug.

 -- joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>  Thu, 28 Nov 1996 12:28:17 +0100

menu (0.3) unstable; urgency=medium
  * Added Depends: shlibs line to controlfile.
  * allowed for spaces in description fields (quote them with "sp ace")
    (so now the "hello" App/Programming entry works!)
  * install default menufile if new one in /etc/menu vanished
  * Assume all packages called "local*" to be installed
  * Now has provision for starting other menu managers (twm),
    and fvwm{,2} modules (mostly untested). (this should be in the fvwm2
    package, though). Note that due to a bug in fvwm2 (install-fvwm2menu?)
    these don't work, at the moment. (See BUGS file in source)
  * First remove the menu-id's of to-be-updated menufiles, as the old
    menufile may have stale menu-id's in it.
  * Added "-v" (verbose) option to update-menus and
    /etc/menu-methods/fvwm2 
  * Still using filenames to encode the package names, but Lars has nearly
    convinced me! (If only I knew how solaris works). Still, I made the
    default menuentries conform Lars' ideas, and people using this package
    can just make (temporarily) both the filename and the entryid have
    the package name in it.

menu (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a few README's to the menu directories
  * now advice the packages to put their menufiles in /usr/lib/menu, after
    suggestion form Joey.
  * Removed buglet from update-menus.
  * Next is from the (unreleased) 0.1 version:
  * Totally changed menu idea; the menu files are now conffiles
    living in /etc/menu; and systemadm and users can run update-menus
    any time something changed in the /etc/menu or the user's ~/.menu
    database.
  * Users can override system-wide menu-database.
    (this is currently not fully implemented: there still is a bug
    when removing system-menu entries)
  * This menu-package now provides some 50 menu entries in /usr/lib/menu
    after installes this package you'll get a nice menu instantly, and
    hopefully, this will serve as a skeleton for other pacakge provides.
    (of cource, /etc/menu entries override the /usr/lib/menu entries).
