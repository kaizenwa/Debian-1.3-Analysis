#!./fvwmgen
#I need menu-0.7 or higer!!
#This file tells /usr/bin/install-fvwmgenmenu how  and where the 
#different window managers like to have there menufiles.
#
#The first line in each section is the name of the window manager.
#(If install-fvwmgenmenu is called from the link /etc/menu-methods/fvwm2,
#install-fvwmgenmenu knows it's to pretend to be the fvwm2 installer,
#and uses the fvwm2 section).
#
#Next, there are:
#  compat   : kind of menu-files to be generated (now only fvwm/fvwm2)
#  supported: the supported "types" for this windowmanger
#             (and the corresponding wrapper files),
#             The most prefered type is listed first, the least preferred
#	      type last (so, if both a text and x11 entry are available,
#	      fvwm2 preferrs the x11 entry (in the file below)).
#              items following a ":" are interpreted as filenames;
#	       items following a "=" used directly.
#  database:  The database of menuentries (from previous runs)
#  mainmenu:  The file in which the fvwm2 main-menus are stored(now only fvwm2)
#  genmenu:   The general menu-file for the window-manager.
#  rcfile:    The "system.*rc" file (if the window manager doesn't support
#             "include", or "read")
#  examplercfile: the input rc file, see above.
#  rootprefix:In generating the complete path of the filenames (exept the
#             wrapperfiles), use this prefix if run as root.
#  userprefix:if run as user.
