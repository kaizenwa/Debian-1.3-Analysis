#I need menu-0.8!
#This file tells /usr/bin/install-fvwmgenmenu how  and where the 
#different window managers like to have there menufiles, what
#display types they support, and how to make the "system.*rc" file.
#
#  compat   : kind of menu-files to be generated (use "gen" for general format)
#  supported: the supported "types" for this windowmanger
#             (and the corresponding wrapper files),
#             The most prefered type is listed first, the least preferred
#	      type last (so, if both a text and x11 entry are available,
#	      fvwm2 preferrs the x11 entry (in the file below)).
#              items following a ":" are interpreted as filenames;
#              items following a "=" used directly.
#             For variable substitution see /usr/doc/menu/README
#  database:  The database of menuentries (from previous runs)
#  mainmenu:  For old install-fvwm2menu compatibility.
#  genmenu:   The general menu-file for the window-manager.
#  rcfile:    The "system.*rc" file (if the window manager doesn't support
#             "include", or "read")
#  examplercfile: the input rc file, see above. 
#  rootprefix:In generating the complete path of the filenames (exept the
#             wrapperfiles), use this prefix if run as root.
#  userprefix:if run as user.
#  input2prefix: If reading input files, first try root/userprefix, but
#              if that file doesn't exist, try input2prefix
#  startmenu :The text that should come before each submenu definition
#  endmenu   :   same, after
#  submenutitle: Text to define a line in a menu that referes to another
#                submenu
