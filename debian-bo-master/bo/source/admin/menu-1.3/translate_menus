#  /etc/menu-methods/menu-translate file for update-menus.
#
#synopsis:
#
#translate x -> y    #where x and y are one of section, id, title, icon, ...
#  x-name  y-name
#  ...
#endtranslate
#
#The translations are done by update-menus: the menu-methods will not
#have to be aware of this.
#

#there's:
#  translate:     only translate for exact matches (RE "^$match\$"
#  subtranslate:  translate for matches of RE "^$match"
#  substitute:    substitute substrings: sed -s "/^$match/$repl/".
#                 this only works for "substitute x->x", and
#		  will give interesting results for " substitute x->y".
# 
#the following will map all Apps/Games sections into Games
# (the /etc/menu-methods will never even know Apps/Games exists,
#  no matter how many packages still use that):

substitute section->section
  Apps/Games/  Games/     #any entry whose $section="Apps/Games"
			    #will now have a section of Games.
endtranslate

# 
# #this could be for those who want different names
# translate title->title
#   Gnuplot    "GnuTeken"
#   Dosemu     "A better DOS than DOS (sometimes)"
# endtranslate
# 
#translate id->title
#  include /usr/lib/menus/LANGUAGE/finnish
#  menu/apps/editors  TekstVeranderaars
#endtranslate
