BUGS:
? - (?) add docs (texi, smgl...)
  - line-count is off by one --is it?
  - install-menu:
?     -sort= doesn't work for submenus
      -xterm-color has wrong hotkey (should be c, is t).
      -in ctwm's menu-method, if I add a line of comment right after the
       "supported" line, prec is read wrong (and XShells disappear).
      -should report arg[1] in case of error (name of script).
      -if treewalk="(m)c", and genmenu=parent($section)+"/hoi", then
       the startmenu's arent written (though the enmenus are!)

  - update-menus: 
?     -package($p) is not general enough!
?     -translate section->section\n  System  Apps/System
         doesn't work. You'll have to make do with
	 "substitute section->section\n System Apps/System"
	 for now.
      -"\n" should be escaped as "\n". (not as "\n", if you get what I mean)
      -Should have a --menu-method option (only run that menu-method)
      -should have config file to turn off "forking to background" (Joey)
 
(question mark on collum one: probably will not do that very soon)
(two question marks: I don't know whether to put a question mark).

totest
  "\"\n" escaped?
  - /usr/sbin/config* menuentries, and su-to-root script
  - install-menu
       mainmenutitle= does work?
  - update-menus
       translate could recieve a lot more testing.

todo:
 -update-menus 
      should output "# 1 filename"
 -adstring.h
      rewrite (read line-by-line, faster, better)
      remember filenames like "# 1 filename" 
  
notes:
  Some files in /usr/lib/menu/default have disappeared. If you very much
  miss one of them, copy it from menu_0.11 and stick it in /etc/menu.
  Alternatively, write a (very polite) note to the maintainer of
  the corresponding package. Note however, that there are at the moment
  no standards that require maintainers to include menuentries in their
  packages.
