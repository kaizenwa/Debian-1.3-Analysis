/* The buffer pool is a unified buffer space containing both the
   pending pool and the rescue pool.  The pending pool holds buffers
   waiting to be written to disk as part of the sequential write of 
   optimised zones; the rescue pool holds the contents of zones about
   to be overwritten by blocks from the write pool.

   The select set is an arbitrary subset of the whole buffer pool.
   This feature is used in various places to select a group of buffers
   for reading or writing. 

   The buffer pool and hash table will not necessarily be totally in
   synch with the relocation maps d2n_map and n2d_map.  It is possible
   for a buffer to exist for a block which, according to the
   relocation maps, is still on disc.  This is because the relocation
   maps are NOT modified by the creation or deletion of pool buffers,
   but only by the actual reading or writing of those pool buffers.
   (The basis of the defragmenter's optimisation is the deferring as
   long as possible of reads and writes, and the sorting of bulk
   reads/writes to improve performance.)
