Emergency release - fixed major bug in extfs bad-block handling code.

===
24 Dec 1992:
Added defrag.8 man page.
===
23 Dec 1992:
Development Version 0.3a

Added minix support - I hope.
There are now two programs, defrag and edefrag, compiled largely from
the same sources but with different #defines.  The object files produced
for each version are incompatible, and the Makefile now properly handles
multiple recompilation of each source file where necessary to produce
two separate object files.

-v no longer produces reams of inode progress report; -vv still does, 
however (and now also lists total blocks per inode).

Tidied up the -vv relocation reporting.
===
21 Dec 1992:
Public Release 0.2

Added CHANGELOG, README, INSTALL files.
Increased default buffer pool.
Removed redundant -l option.
===
19 Dec 1992:
Pre-alpha Release 0.2

Improvements over release 0.1:
Improved handling of -v, -s and -l switches.
Added -DNODEBUG to disable debugging features (and assertions).
Now sorts inodes sensibly before reallocating data.
Data relocation is now highly optimised with buffered and sorted reads/writes.
User-configurable buffer pool size.
Added -r (readonly) option for testing and confidence.  Supplies an estimate
  of how hard the defragmenter will have to work.

Still no minix-fs support.
===
13 Dec 1992:
Tidy of release 0.1.
Added option help to usage error message.
Added better version information with version.h.
Moved buffer management to buffers.c
===

Release 0.1

Linux disc defragmenter release 0.1 committed to CVS
No optimisation; no buffering; no Minix-fs support.
First semi-public release.
===
3 Dec 1992: 
Original version based on efsck 0.9 alpha by Remy Card and Linus
Torvalds.
