Bugs:
    1. The relocation algorithm is not stable for ext2 fs. That is
    that if you run e2defrag on a recently defragmented filesystem,
    it will rearrange some files, not improving the fragmentation
    level. You can run it more and more times, it will move some files 
    forth and back without any further improvements. 
    
    2. Picture can be broken, if the program had been suspended with ^Z and 
    resumed after that.

    3. Ncurses package does not work well with all terminfo databases.
    It requires its own version of the database.
