Installation:

There isn't much to configure.  If you really want to change the
default pool size, edit the definition of int pool_size near the top
of buffers.c (currently 512).

Edit the Makefile if you want to change compiler options.  You can add
in the -DNODEBUG define if you like; it will compile out the -d (debug
mode) switch from *defrag, and will also omit the run-time consistency
checks.  There's not that much to be gained from omiting this code,
though.

If you want to generate a debugging binary, you don't have to edit the
makefile: just do a "make DEBUG=true [target]".

Normally, you can compile the whole thing just by typing "make".
"make dep" will be done automatically if there is not already a
.depend file in the directory.  "make install" will install the
binaries and man pages.

*** TERMINFO NOTE *** 

Please note: Somewhere in the 1.1.x series of kernels, the linux
console display driver became unable to interpret the ACS_DIAMOND
escape sequence generated by ncurses-1.8.5.  This prevents the *dump
and *defrag full-screen display routines from working properly.

In the defrag-0.61/terminfo subdirectory, you will find a version of
the linux terminfo capabilities file, and the precompiled c/console
file, which have ACS_DIAMOND disabled.  If you find that console
display is corrupt, try using this new version in place of your old
/usr/lib/terminfo/c/console terminfo file.
