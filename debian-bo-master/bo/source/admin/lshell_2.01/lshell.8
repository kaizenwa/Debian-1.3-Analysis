.TH LSHELL 8 "LShell Utility -- Version 2.01" "S. Joel Katz" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
lshell \- Securely establish process limits upon login
.SH SYNOPSIS
Make a copy a user's login shell.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B LShell
allows a system administrator to easily set and maintain per-user
limits on CPU time, number of processes, virtual memory usage, and open
files. A master file (/etc/lshell.conf) contains a default entry and overriding
entries for specific users.
.PP
.SH /etc/lshell.conf
This file contains the entries for the resource limits. Each line consists
of a username optionally followed by resource limits. If resource limits are
present, they may be followed by a comment.
.PP
The last line is the default entry and can contain any name that does not
represent a user on the system.
.B Default
is typically used.
.PP
If there is no second field, no limits are imposed on that user. Otherwise,
the second field consists of a letter identifying the resource to be limited
and a number specifying the limit. Multiple limits are simply concatenated
together. If multiple entries appear for the same user, the first is used.
.PP
Valid resource limiters are
.B F
followed by the number of file descriptors,
.B P
followed by the number of processes,
.B C
followed by the maximum CPU time in minutes, and
.B D
followed by the in-memory data limit in Megabytes.
.PP
Reasonable limits for typical users are C60D20F96P28
.SH VERSION
.B lshell
version 2.01, March 11, 1995.
.SH WARNINGS
The user name in
.B /etc/lshell.conf
must exactly match (case included) the entry in
.B /etc/passwd.
.SH BUGS
None. Just undocumented features. If you discover any bugs, please mail them
to the author (Joel Katz) at Stimpson@Panix.COM.
.PP
Some versions of bash fail to correctly report the limit on the number of
file descriptors, however
.B lshell
does set this limit properly.
