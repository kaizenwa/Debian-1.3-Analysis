DESCRIPTION: Enforce limits to protect system integrity. 
 This program enforces resource quotas stored in a configuration file. It is
 easier and more secure that writing a shell script in /etc/profile and
 trying to compare user names in hard-coded if/else type trees.
DEPENDS: libc5 (>=5.2.18-5)
ARCHITECTURE: =A
SECTION: admin
PRIORITY: optional
