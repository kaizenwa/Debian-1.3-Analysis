<H2>Dselect documentation for beginners.</H2>

<P>This file documents Dselect for first-time users and is intended to
help in getting Debian installed successfully. It makes no attempt to explain
everything, so when you first meet dselect work through the help screens.</P>

<P>Dselect is used to select just which <A HREF="#Package">packages</A>
<!-- XXX update this number -->
(from ~1100) you wish to install. It will be run for you during the install
and as it is a very powerful and somewhat complex thing, some knowledge
of it before hand will not go astray. It will step you through the package
installation process as follows: </P>

<UL>
<P>Choose the access method to use.<BR>
Update list of available packages, if possible. <BR>
Request which packages you want on your system. <BR>
Install and upgrade wanted packages. <BR>
Configure any packages that are unconfigured. <BR>
Remove unwanted software.</P>
</UL>

<P><BR>
<BR>
As each step is completed successfully it will lead you on to the next.
Go through them in order without skipping any steps. </P>

<P>Here and there in this document we talk of starting another shell. Linux
has 6 console sessions or shells available at any one time. You switch
betwen them by hitting &lt;LEFT-ALT&gt; &lt;F1&gt; ... &lt;F6&gt;, after
which you log in on your new shell and go ahead. The shell used by the
install process is #1 so hit &lt;LEFT-ALT&gt; &lt;F1&gt;when you want to
return to that process.</P>

<P>Once in dselect you will get this screen:- </P>

<H4>Debian Linux `dselect' package handling front end.</H4>

<PRE>0.  [A]ccess  Choose the access method to use. 
1.  [U]pdate  Update list of available packages, if possible. 
2   [S]elect  Request which packages you want on your system.
3.  [I]nstall Install and upgrade wanted packages. 
4.  [C]onfig  Configure any packages that are unconfigured. 
5.  [R]emove  Remove unwanted software.
6.  [Q]uit    Quit dselect.</PRE>

<PRE> Let's look at these one by one.</PRE>

<H3>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><BR>
0 Access: </H3>

<P>Here's the access screen: </P>

<H4><BR>
dselect - list of access methods </H4>

<UL>
<PRE><B>Abbrev.   Description 
</B>cdrom     Install from a CD-ROM.
nfs       Install from an NFS server (not yet mounted). 
harddisk  Install from a hard disk partition (not yet mounted). 
mounted   Install from a filesystem which is already mounted. 
floppy    Install from a pile of floppy disks. 
ftp       Install using ftp. </PRE>
</UL>

<P><BR>
Here we tell dselect where our packages are. Note that the first three
items are just a convenience and it would be just as good if you mounted
your cdrom, nfs mount or other partition yourself and then used the _mounted_
option. It follows that if your cdrom _is_ already mounted then you use
the _mounted_ item, rather than the cdrom item. The same thing goes for
nfs and for partitions on your harddisk. </P>

<P>If you run into a problem here - maybe Linux can not see your cdrom,
your nfs mount is not working or you have forgotten which partition the
packages are on - you have a couple of options:-</P>

<LI>Start another shell. Fix the problem and then return to the main shell.
<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Quit dselect and run it again later. You might even need to shut down
the computer to solve some problem. This is quite ok but when you come
back to dselect run it as root. It will not be run automatically after
the first time. </LI>

<P><BR>
After you choose the access method dselect will get you to indicate the
precise location of the packages. If you do not get this right the first
time hit ^C and return to the Access item.</P>

<P>Once you are through here you will be returned to the main screen. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><BR>
1 Update </H3>

<P>Dselect will read the <B>Packages</B> or <B>Packages.gz</B> files from
the mirror and create a database on your system of all available packages.
</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3>2 Select</H3>

<P>Hang on to your hat. This is where it all happens. The object of the
excercise is to select just which packages you wish to have installed.
</P>

<P>Hit &lt;Enter&gt;. If you have a slow machine be aware that the screen
will clear and can remain blank for 15 seconds so don't start bashing keys
at this point.</P>

<P>The first thing that comes up on the screen is page 1 of the Help file.
You can get to this help by hitting <B>?</B> at any point in the Select
screens and you can page through the help screens by hitting the <B>.</B>
(full stop) key. </P>

<P>Before you dive in note these points: </P>

<LI>To <B>exit</B> the Select screen after all selections are complete,
hit &lt;Enter&gt;. This will return you to the main screen <B>if</B> there
is no problem with your selection. Else you will be asked to deal with
that problem. When you are happy with any given screen hit &lt;Enter&gt;
to get out. <BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>_Problems_</B> are quite normal and are to be expected. If you select
package A and that package requires package B to run, then dselect will
warn you of the problem and will most likely suggest a solution. If package
A conflicts with package B (they are mutually exclusive) you will be asked
to decide between them. <BR>
</LI>

<P>Let's look at the top two lines of the Select screen. </P>

<PRE><B>dselect - recursive package listing               mark:+/=/- verbose:v help:? 
EIOM Pri Section Package Description </B></PRE>

<P>This tells us of some of the special keys:-</P>

<PRE>+      Select a package for installation.
=      Place a package on hold - useful on a broken package. You can reinstall an older 
         version and place it on hold while you wait for a new one to appear. 
-      Remove a package
_      Remove a package and its config files.
i,I    Toggle/cycle info displays.
o,O    Cycle through the sort options.
v,V    Is a terse/verbose toggle. Use this key to unlock the meanings of EIOM on line two,
       but I'll give you a summary here anyway. (Note that upper and lower case keys are 
       quite different in effect.) 

<B>Flag   Meaning           Possible values 
</B>E      Error             Space, R, I
I      Installed state   Space, *, -, U, C, I 
O      Old mark          *, -, =, _, n
M      Mark              *, -, =, _, n 

</PRE>

<P><BR>
Rather that spell all this out here I refer you to the Help screens where
all is revealed. One example though. <BR>
You enter dselect and find a line like this:-</P>

<PRE><B>EIOM Pri  Section  Package   Description 
</B>  ** Opt  misc     loadlin   a loader (running under DOS) for LINUX kernel
</PRE>

<P><BR>
This is saying that loadlin was selected when you last ran dselect and
that it is still selected, but it is not installed. Why not? The answer
must be that the loadlin package is not physically avaiable. It is missing
from your mirror. </P>

<P>The information which dselect uses to get all the right packages installed
is buried in the packages themselves. Nothing in this world is perfect
and it does sometimes happen that the dependancies built into a package
are incorrect, with the result that dselect simply cannot resolve the situation.
A way out is provided where the user can regain control and it takes the
form of the commands Q and X which are available in the Select screen.
</P>

<PRE><B>Q</B>   An over-ride. Forces dselect to ignore the built in dependancies and to do what you have 
      specified. The results, of course, will be on your own head. 
<B>X</B>   Use <B>X</B> if you get totally lost. It puts things back the way they were and exits. </PRE>

<P>Keys which help you _not_ to get lost (!) are <B>R</B>, <B>U</B> and
<B>D</B>. </P>

<PRE><B>R</B>   Cancels all selections at this level. Does not affect selections made
      at the previous level.
<B>U</B>   If dselect has proposed changes and you have made further changes U will
      restore dselect's selections.
<B>D</B>   Removes the selections made by dselect, leaving only yours.

</PRE>

<P><B>An example: </B></P>

<P>The boot-floppies package depends on these packages:-<BR>
libc5-pic <BR>
ncurses3.0-pic <BR>
mkrboot <BR>
ncurses3.0-dev <BR>
</P>

<P>The person maintaining boot-floppies also thinks that the following
packages should be installed. These are not, however, essential:- </P>

<PRE>loadlin
fdos 
dosemu 

So when I select boot-floppies I get this screen: 

<B>dselect - recursive package listing mark:             +/=/- verbose:v help:?
EIOM Pri Section Package Description

</B>  _* Opt devel boot-floppie Scripts to create the Debian installationfloppy
  _* Xtt devel libc5-pic Kit for building specialized versions of the sha
  _* Xtr devel ncurses3.0-p Video termial manipulation: Shared-library subs
  _* Opt devel mkrboot Make a kernel + rootimage bootable from one disk
  _* Opt devel ncurses3.0-d Video terminal manipulation: Developer's librari
  _* Opt misc loadlin a loader (running under DOS) for LINUX kernel i
  _* Opt misc fdos Free DOS (Kernel + boot utilities + Documentatio 
  __ Opt misc dosemu The Linux DOS Emulator</PRE>

<PRE>See how all the required packages have been selected for me.

</PRE>

<P>The <B>R</B> key puts things back to the starting point. </P>

<PRE><B>dselect - recursive package listing mark:             +/=/- verbose:v help:?

</PRE>

<P>(If I decide now that I don't want boot-floppies I just hit &lt;Enter&gt;.)<BR>
</P>

<P>The <B>D </B>key puts things the way I selected them in the first place.
</P>

<PRE><B>dselect - recursive package listing mark:             +/=/- verbose:v help:?

<P>The <B>U</B> key restores dselect's selections. </P>

</PRE>

<P>I suggest running with the defaults for now - you will have ample opportunity
of adding more later. A possible exception which you may choose to deselect
depending on your experience is:- </P>

<PRE><B>emacs</B> (very big, not everyone wants it)
</PRE>

<P>And I would suggest not installing: </P>

<PRE><B>inn</B>   (big, difficult to get going)
<B>x11</B>   (big, difficult to get going)</PRE>

<P>Whatever you decide, hit &lt;Enter&gt; to accept and return to the main
screen. If this results in unresolved problems you will be bounced right
back to another problem resolution screen. </P>

<P>So the <B>R</B>, <B>U</B> and <B>D</B> keys are very useful in what_if
situations. You can experiment at will and then restore everything and
start again. <B>Don't</B> look on them as being in a glass box labelled
<B>Break In Emergency. </B></P>

<P>After making your selections in the Select screen, hit <B>I</B> to give
you a big window, <B>t</B> to take you to the beginning and then use the
<B>page-down</B> key to look quickly through the settings. This way you
can check the results of your work and spot glaring errors. Some people
have dselected whole groups of packages by mistake and not noticed the
error until too late. Dselect is a _very_ powerful tool so don't misuse
it. </P>

<P>You should now have this situation:-</P>

<PRE><B>package category     status

</B>required             all selected
important            all selected
standard             mostly selected
optional             mostly dselected
extra                mostly dselected
</PRE>

<P>Happy? Hit &lt;Enter&gt; to exit the Select process. You can come back
and run Select again if you wish. </P>

<H3>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><BR>
3 Install </H3>

<!-- XXX update numbers -->
<P>Dselect runs through the entire 1100 packages and installs those selected.
Expect to get asked to make decisions as you go. It is often useful to
switch to a different shell to compare, say, an old config with a new one.
If the old file is conf.modules the new one will be conf.modules.dpkg-new.
</P>

<P>The screen scrolls past fairly quickly on a new machine. You can stop/start
it with ^S/^Q and at the end of the run you will get a list of any uninstalled
packages. If you want to keep a record of everything that happens use normal
Unix features like tee or script. </P>

<P>It can happen that a package does not get installed because it depends on 
some other package which is listed for installation but is not yet installed. 
The answer here is to run Install again.  Cases have been reported where it 
was necessary to run it 4 times before everything slipped into place. </P>

<H3>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><BR>
4 Configure </H3>

<P>Most packages get configured in step 3, but anything left hanging can
be configured here.</P>

<H3>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><BR>
5 Remove </H3>

<P>Removes packages that are installed but no longer required. </P>

<H3>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><BR>
6 Quit </H3>

<P>I suggest running <B>/etc/cron.daily/find </B>at this point as you have
a lot of new files on your system. Then you can use <B>locate</B> to get
the location of any given file. </P>

<H4>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><BR>
A few hints in conclusion.</H4>

<P>When the install process runs dselect for you, you will doubtless be
eager to get Debian running ASAP. Well, please be prepared to take an hour
or so as you have to learn your way around and then get it right. When
you enter the Select screen for the first time don't make ANY selections
at all - just hit &lt;Enter&gt; and see what dependancy problems there
are. Try fixing them. If you find yourself back at the main screen run
<B>Select</B> again. </P>

<P>You can get an idea of the size of a package by hitting <B>i </B>twice
and looking for the Size figure. This is the size of the crunched package,
so the uncrunched files will be a lot bigger. </P>

<P>Installing a new Debian system is a very complex thing, but dselect
can do it for you as easily as can be. So take the time to learn how to
drive it. Read the help screens and experiment with <B>i, I, o,</B> and
<B>O</B>. Use the <B>R</B> key. It's all there, but it's up to you to use
it effectively.</P>
