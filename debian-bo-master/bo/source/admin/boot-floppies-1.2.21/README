This package allows you to create a Debian installation system on
floppy disk or other media, for bootstrapping Debian onto a new
system. Most users will simply download the disk images to do this, so
the boot-floppies package will generally only be used by advanced
Debian maintainers.

Steps:
- `cd /usr/src/boot-floppies'
- adapt the variables in Makefile to your local environment
- run `make'
  This compile the programs that are specially designed for the
  installation disks, extracts programs from the Debian FTP mirror and
  builds all the disks.
