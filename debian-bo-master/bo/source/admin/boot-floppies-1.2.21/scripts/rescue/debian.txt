This is the Debian Rescue floppy. Keep it once you have installed
your system, as you can boot from it to repair the system on your
hard disk if that ever becomes necessary (press <F3> for details).

On most systems, you can go ahead and press <ENTER> to begin
installation.  You will probably want to try doing that before you try
anything else.  If you run into trouble, or if you already have
questions, press the function key <F1> for quick installation help.

WARNING: You should completely back up all of your hard disks before
     proceeding. The installation procedure can completely and
     irreversibly erase them! If you haven't made backups yet, remove
     the floppy from the disk drive and press <RESET> or
     <Control-Alt-Del> to get back to your old system.

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law. For copyright information, press <F10>.

This floppy uses Linux __kernel_version__ (from __kernel_image__)

Press <F1> for help, or <ENTER> to boot!
