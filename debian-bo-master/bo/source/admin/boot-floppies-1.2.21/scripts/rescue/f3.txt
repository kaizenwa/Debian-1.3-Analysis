
BOOT METHODS

At the `boot:' prompt you can enter a boot method followed by boot
parameters. (Boot parameters are listed in the <F4> and <F5> screens.)

Available boot methods:
m4_ifdef(`__size1440__',
`default
  Start the installation.
')
(For these two methods you need an extra root floppy.)
ramdisk0 (or ramdisk1)
  Start installation, load the ramdisk from the first 
  (or the second) floppy drive
floppy0 (or floppy1)
  Start installation, mount the floppy in the first (or the second)
  floppy drive as root.
  (If you have only one floppy drive, you cannot load base from
  floppy0, but you can install from other media (CD, harddisk ...)

m4_ifdef(`__lowmem__',
`

',
`rescue
  Boot and mount any root filesystem. The root filesystem must be given at
  the prompt, so e.g. type `rescue root=/dev/hda1'')

m4_ifdef(`__size1440__',`',`

')
