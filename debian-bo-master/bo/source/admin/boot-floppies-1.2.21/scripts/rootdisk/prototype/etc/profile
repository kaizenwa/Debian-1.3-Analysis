"You are running \"ash\", a Bourne-shell clone. The root filesystem is
a RAM disk or floppy disk. The hard disk filesystems are mounted under
\"/target\". The editor available to you on this floppy is \"ae\". It's
very small and easy to figure out - sorry but \"vi\" and \"emacs\"
wouldn't fit. To get an idea of what Unix utilities are available to
you, run \"ls /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin\". The key combination
Alt-F1 switches to the first console window, and Alt-F2 switches to the
second one.
