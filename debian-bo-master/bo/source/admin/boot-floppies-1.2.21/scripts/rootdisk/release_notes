This is the Debian Rescue floppy. Keep it once you have installed
your system, as you can boot from it to repair the system on your
hard disk if that ever becomes necessary.

Debian's developers are more than __developers__ unpaid volunteers from all
around the world, collaborating via the Internet. We have formed the
non-profit organization "Software in the Public Interest" to sponsor
this development. We'd like to thank the many businesses, universities,
and individuals who contributed the free software upon which Debian is
based. The Free Software Foundation should also be recognized for the
many programs they have contributed and for their pioneering role in
developing the free software concept and the GNU project.
