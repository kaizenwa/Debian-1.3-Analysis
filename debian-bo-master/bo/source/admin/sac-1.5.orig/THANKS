  Thanks go out to the following people who have helped me debug and extend
sac to the pinnacle of perfection that it is. =)

Ian Harris
  - Found bug in the way sac releases logins when EOF is reached that made
    clipping not perform correctly (only for logins currently active).
  - Suggested extending -s and -e options to allow for more precision than
    just days. Thus: mm/dd/yy [hh:mm[:ss]] (implemented as -M [hourrange]
    for the time being).

Jason Lavoie
  - Provided tacacs wtmp to implement -t (now -X[3|4]) option to support tacacs
    special wtmp format.

Ben Deptola
  - Suggested the -b option.

Scott Burch
  - Suggested -o option to support tacacs old wtmp format. Provided wtmp for
    testing.

Edward S. Marshall
  - Added functionality to the Makefile and FSSTND compliance.

Thomas Pawlikaniec
  - Got me to implement clipping finally.
  - Suggested --help option.
  - Made C code comments reflect reality.
  - Suggested -x option.

Erik Horn
  - Suggested allowing wildcards for -T option.

Thomas Moore
  - Contributed patmatch() code for wildcarding.

Daniel Lafraia
Marcelo ?
Luis Felipe Balbinot
James Murray
  - Helped diagnose and provided wtmp files to fix daylight savings time
    problem.  Also bugged the hell out of me. =)

Jason Philbrook
  - Provided radius detail file and other files for helping implement radius
    support.

Jaime Garcia Ghirelli
  - Provided tacacs 4.x wtmp for sac to support (via -X4) it's new utmp format.
  - Pointed out problem with -t option.

Bruno Lopes F. Cabral
  - Pointed out problems with -t option when used with -s and/or -e.
  - Suggested --version option.
  - Suggested gnuplot graphs for usage. (looking into it).

Jordan Mendelson
  - Showed me how screwed up my radius processing was.
  - Suggested allowing more than one wtmp on the command line (make -w option
    list oriented).

  Plus others who might have gotten lost in the heap of mail I get from all
the mailing lists I subscribe to.  Mostly these people just complain, so who
cares eh? =)
