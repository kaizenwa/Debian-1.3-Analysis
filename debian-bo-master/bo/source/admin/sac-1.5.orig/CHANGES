Version 1.5
  - Changed the way sac handles -w so that it works simular to -R so you
    may specify multiple wtmp's (or radius detail files).  The type of wtmp
    file or radius file is determined by its position in the command line.
  - Added -r option to sac to output "raw" output.  Prints about everything
    sac knows about your wtmp.  Quite verbose.  Usefull for a backend to
    a graphics filter or accounting package.
  - Small fix to fix daylight savings time that broke for Brazil, possibly
    others.
  - Added --version option to sac.
  - Displays # of hours used for each hour in the hourly profile display.
  - Fixed -t option when used with -s and/or -e options.
  - Added some argument processing sanity checks.
  - Fixed hourly profile output I broke in 1.4.
  - Fixed -t option which would report incorrect times when using an old wtmp
    file.
  - Added support for tacacs 4.x utmp format with -X4 option.  3.4 - 3.5
    format is the default with -X3 or just -X.
  - Made output of -am report only # of logins that are applied to total
    time.
  - Added radius support with -R [portmaster-name [portmaster-name [...]]].
    The radius accounting directory is compile time definable in the
    Makefile.
  - Rawtmp: added -X[3|4] and --version options.

Version 1.4
  - Added wildcard support to -H and -T options, to make it easy to select
    many ttys or hostnames with wildcards. "*", "?", "[...]" and "[^...]" are
    supported.
  - Fixed xtacacs wtmp support, does anyone need this anymore?
  - Maybe, possibly, hopefully, finally fixed the damn daylight savings time
    problem!  ARRRGHH!!!  We no longer assume 24 hours in a day.
  - Added -d option to rawtmp to show time in a more human readable format,
    and made rawtmp read from stdin if "-" given as filename to -w option.
  - Made +0/-0 work with the -s and -e options.
  - Fixed "check" script to actually work properly with fractions.
  - Changed -t (read xtacacs format) to -X.  Also changed in rawtmp.
  - Report by tty line (-t option), nice for looking at the usage on your
    modems.
  - Added -M option to perform accounting for specific hours of a day instead
    of the entire day.

Version 1.3.1
  - Fixed problem with -s and -e options which would not function during
    daylight savings time (We don't have the cursed daylight savings time in
    Indiana, so it took a while before I realized there really was a
    problem).
  - Small insignificant code changes.

Version 1.3
  - Added -f option to perform ftp login accounting in addition to normal
    login accounting.
  - Added -F option to perform ftp login accounting only.
  - Added some example scripts.
  - Fixed speeling misteaks.
  - Fixed error where clipping could in certain cases incorrectly report the
    correct amount of clipped login time while the user was stilled logged in.
  - Added -m option to show minimum and maximum concurrent logins.
  - Made sac read from stdin if "-" given as filename to -w option.
  - Added -H host-list to perform accounting on logins from specific hosts.
  - Made sac utmp size independent, for huge utmp sizes. (256 bytes for a
    host-name?  That's gonna make wtmp HUGE! 6x as large as it is now! I
    already have a wtmp that grows 30MB in a month! Must be a Posix thing.)
  - _Finally_ made sac properly handle -s and -e options with per user
    accounting.  STOP BOTHERING ME ABOUT IT ALREADY! =)

Version 1.2
  - Added -o option to handle old or broken wtmp's not created by linux
    itself, such as those created by the tacacs terminal server.
  - Added -t option to handle some ancient format that tacacs apparently
    uses.
  - Added -b for producing a determination of how much login time has
    precisely been used over the last few hours.  Useful for determining
    if someone has been logged in say the last 4 hours: sac -bp 4 bubba
  - Added -c option to perform login clipping, thus only show how much login
    is really being used by counting multiple logins as only one login.
  - Handles xterms that work (sorta) by logging login and logout as a user
    process and dead process respectfully.
  - Added --help option to print a verbose usage listing.
  - Added -x user-list for excluding certain users from accounting.
  - Added -u user-list which is the default.
  - Added -T tty-list to perform accounting on only certain ttys.
  - Added --help, -s, -e, -b, and -t options to rawtmp.

Version 1.1
  - Added the -s and -e options for starting and ending dates.
  - Handles time changes that netdate logs in wtmp file (I think).
  - Fixed, err, made more robust, some possible divide by zero errors.
  - Throws out null wtmp entries (where do these come from?)
  - Corrected(?) argument parsing.
  - Added rawtmp command.

Version 1.0
  - The original, perfect as it was.
