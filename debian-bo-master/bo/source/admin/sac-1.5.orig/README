  This is Sac, which stands for System ACcounting or maybe Steve's AC... =)

  It's absolutely free, use it, abuse it, talk dirty to it... _I don't care_.

  This program is freely distributable free-ware with no limitations on
copying or redistribution.  If it breaks, well it's probably my fault, but
I won't admit to it!

  Feel free to improve it if you can... Wtmp documentation I have really is
lacking and so I am definitely not handling some certain cases, especially
with respect to time warps.  A nice graphical front end for showing pretty
graphs of usage would be nice.  Seems some people need pictures to
understand data... I blame TV!

  You can for the time being contact me via e-mail at ice@mama.indstate.edu.
I'll try and help you add in new features or whatever else you need.

  Oh well... This was developed on Linux, for Linux... You're welcome to
port it to other systems, but I don't care about em...  Linux is the way,
the _only_ way as far as I'm concerned.
