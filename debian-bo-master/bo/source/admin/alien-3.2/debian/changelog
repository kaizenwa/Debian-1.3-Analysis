  * Fixed a bug that made alien choke on rpm files that had a version number
    or release number of 0. Releasing only to frozen, because there is a
    newer version in unstable.

  * Added a patch file for Applixware.
  * I'm looking for patch files for other commercial software, to add to the
    package. If you own commerical linux software and would like to
    contribute a patch, please contact me.

  * Generated debian/rules files will no longer pass package name to debstd
    (And neither does the debian/rules file for this package.)
  * Added -s switch for low disk space situations.
  * Added -i switch to build a package but not install it.
  * Added long options (--option), as I can never remember the short ones.
  * Fixed bug in guessing name of patch file to use.
  * Fixed bug that would not let you specify a patch file in the current
    directory, or a relative path to a patch file.
  * Don't use /etc/rpmrc as an indiciation of whether rpm is present, as 
    this is a conffile, and might be deleted. Test for actual rpm binary.
  * More friendly error message if patch file is not found, suggesting that
    you try -n option.
  * Rewrote the code that figures out information about the rpm files so it
    uses rpm --queryformat to determine everything.
  * If a rpm has a changelog, add it to the end of debian/changelog.
  * Add summary to the Description: field of generated control files.
  * Add info from a rpm's copyright field to to the copyright file.
