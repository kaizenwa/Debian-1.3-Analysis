.TH PNPDUMP 8 "10 Jan 1997" "isapnptools"
.SH NAME
pnpdump \- Dump ISA Plug-And-Play devices resource information
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpnpdump\fP [ \fIdevs\fP \fIreadport\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpnpdump\fP will scan all the ISA PnP cards, dumping
their resource data to \fIstdout\fP.

The output is in a form that can be used by \fBisapnp\fP,
except that the actual configuration statements are commented
out. See \fBisapnp.conf(5)\fP for details of the format.

By default, \fBpnpdump\fP will reset all the cards into
the inactive state, then ISOLATE each one and allocate it
a handle (Card Select Number).

Resetting the cards may be undesireable, in which case two additional
parameters may be supplied:
.SS Parameters
.TP
\fIdevs\fP
is the \fInumber of PnP cards\fP that the BIOS has found, ISOLATEd and
allocated CSNs to in the system.
Note that if this is greater than the actual number of cards in the system,
pnpdump will stop scanning when it receives a first serial identifier byte
of 0xff (this is what happens when there isn't a card with that CSN).
.TP
\fIreadport\fP
is the address of the \fIreadport\fP to use for the
Plug-And-Play access. The number base is determined
by the format: a leading \fI0x\fP implies hex,
a leading \fI0\fP implies octal,
otherwise decimal is assumed.

The address of the \fIreadport\fP must be chosen to
avoid any conflicts with existing (non Plug and Play)
hardware, and must be in the range 0x203..0x3ff.
.PP
Note that for these two parameters to work, you must
have a PnP BIOS which has already carried out the
ISOLATION process correctly.
