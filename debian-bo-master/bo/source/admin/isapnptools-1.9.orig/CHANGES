isapnp (now v1.9)
-----------------
1) Modified parsing so that keywords don't need repeating uneccesarily, eg
(REG 0 (PEEK))(REG 1 (PEEK))
may be simplified to
(REG 0 (PEEK) 1 (PEEK))
and similarly for IO, DMA, MEM, and INT.
2) Fixed peek device name (was always the last device).
3) Improved error printout to print the remainder of the line.
4) Allow funny characters in the ident (@[\]^_).
5) Print error if board not found even if debug not set.
