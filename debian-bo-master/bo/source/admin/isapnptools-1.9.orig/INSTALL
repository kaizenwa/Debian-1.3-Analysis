	ISA PnP utilities Installation
	==============================

1) Edit the makefile to suit local conditions.
---------------------------------------------
Note that these will depend on your library versions. The
Makefile as supplied is for libc-5.2.18. If you have a newer
library, then some of the syscalls may already be provided
in the library, so remove the appropriate -D.
For example: If you get an error message such as

pnpdump.c:29: conflicting types for 'nanosleep'
usr/include/time.h:122: previous declaration of 'nanosleep'
make: *** [pnpdump.o] Error 1

then you need to remove the -DNEEDSNANOSLEEP from the PNPFLAGS
line in the Makefile.

2) As anyone,
------------
make

to make the programs isapnp and pnpdump.

3) As root,
-----------
make install

or if you prefer, just make install.man or install.bin

4) Read the manual pages, particularly isapnp.conf.5.
-----------------------------------------------------

5) Run pnpdump to generate an isapnp.conf file:
-----------------------------------------------
pnpdump > /etc/isapnp.conf

NOTE: pnpdump will unconfigure all ISA PnP cards, if this is
undesirable, give pnpdump two command line parameters, the
number of ISA PnP cards in the system, and the IO address to
use for the readport, eg:

pnpdump 1 0x3bb > /etc/isapnp.conf

If you say there are more cards than there are, the first missing
one will return all 0xff for their idents; pnpdump will ignore
this one, and any after this.


6) Edit the isapnp.conf file to place the device(s)
---------------------------------------------------
where your driver(s) expect. This is where step 4 would have
been useful.

a) All configuration information is commented out, so uncomment
the lines beginning with '# (' that you want to use.
b) If the resource data specified a range of values, then only
the first will be put in the config entry. This should be editted
to suit.
c) DON'T FORGET to uncomment the (ACT Y) at the end of the logical
device entry if you want the device enabled !


7) Run isapnp
-------------
on the isapnp.conf file to check it has no errors.

8) Do whatever is necessary to initialise the device drivers:
-------------------------------------------------------------
run setserial, or insmod the drivers. Check they work.
Refer to the README for more details.

9) Edit the system bootup scripts
---------------------------------
to run isapnp and install the drivers etc as above.
