.TH ANACRON 8 "22 August 1996"
.SH NAME
anacron \- anac(h)ronistic daemon to execute scheduled commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
anacron
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I anacron
is a cron-like program that doesn't go by time.
.PP
It is useful for jobs, that don't have to run at a certain time, but
in a certain period. (That's why anacron was called `pe', periodic
execution, before.)
.PP
By not specifying a certain time when a job has to be executed
it is possible to use anacron on systems that don't run continously
but are powered on at different times every day.
.PP
For example, anacron can be used to control the jobs in /etc/cron.daily,
/etc/cron.weekly, and /etc/cron.monthly on a Debian system.
.PP
When
.I anacron
is started, it first reads the file /etc/anacrontab. This file includes
a list of jobs that need to be run regularly. (See manual page
.I anacrontab(5)
for syntax details.)
