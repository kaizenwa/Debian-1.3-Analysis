.TH PWGEN 1
.SH NAME
pwgen \- generate pronounceable passwords
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I pwgen length \[count\]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pwgen
generates random, meaningless but pronounceable passwords. Depending
on how the program was installed, these words contain either only
lowercase letters, or upper and lower case mixed, or digits thrown
in. Uppercase letters and digits are placed in a way that eases
remembering their position when memorizing only the word.
.P
.I pwgen
does not interact with the system's password handling. All it does is
print out one or more passwords that can subsequently be used as input
for
.I passwd
(1) or for similar applications.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I length
(number from 4 to 16) specifies the maximum password length. This
parameter is required.
.TP
.I count
specifies how many passwords to produce. Defaults to one.
.SH SEE ALSO
.I passwd
(1)
.SH BUGS
.PD 0
