pdmenu (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * SYSV3 portability changes:
  	* Fall back on floor() if rint() is not available.
  	* Fix CFLAGS in Makefile.
  * Got rid of use of perl in pdmenurc.debian file.

    because deeply nested debian menus can have quite long names.

  * Improved line wrapping when displaying command output in a window.
  * Added 't' flag, which is the same as 'd', but truncates command output.
    Makes some things look much better when displayed in windows.
    (At request of Steve Frampton.)

  	  calculated expression as the size of the string.

0.3	3rd public release				21JUN96
		Removed "-n" flag. Now, color is off by default. To turn it
			on, either use the "-c" flag, or set the COLORTERM 
			environment variable. (Setting COLORTERM has the side 
			effect of making color work properly in jed, slrn, and 
			maybe other programs that use the slang library.)
		"make config" now works even if you only have perl 4.x, not
			just 5.x
		Ctrl-r forces a screen redraw.
		Split config.h up into lots of little .h files, should make
			it easier to configure different things.

0.3pre6 Final bugfix					15JUN96
		'p' flag works again (oops...)
		Revamped rc file processing.
		Control and high-bit characters in menus are changed to spaces.
		Tab characters in menus/windows are ok now.
		Avoided making color combos that blink on the linux console 
			be the default colors.
		Allowed default colors to be configured in config.h
		Commands that return null output can be run with the 'w'
			flag without problems.	
		Added "nop" command for a blank line in the menu.

0.3pre5 More bugfixing					11MAR96
		Kept it from stomping on $HOME. (oops..)
		Fixed key handling, although it's still far from perfect.
		Added home and end key handling.
		Other minor fixes.

0.3pre4	Bugfix and minor improvements			27JAN96
		No shadows in B&W mode, faster scrolling on slow terminals, 
			and other cosmetic fixes.
		Fixed nasty problem with menus greater than 127 lines long.
		Fixed ShowMessage to work with broken gcc.
		's' flag to exec command to set environment variables.
		More robust parsing of rc file.
		Sped up screen redraws, thanks to John E. Davis, author of
			S-LANG.
		Fixed make config.

0.3pre3	Creeping featureitus				18JAN96
		Fixed 'd' without 'n' flag so it'll not segfault.
		'e' flag to exec command to let you enter text.
		'd' flag to exec command to display output of command in a
			window.
		Configurable colors via the "color" command.
		Menus can now contain more items than will fit on the
			screen; they scroll.

0.3pre2	Bugfix						11JAN96
		Created autoconfig script ("make config").
		Lots and lots of bugs fixed.
		Added -n and -q switches.

0.3pre1	The need for speed				10JAN96
		**IMPORTANT** This version is a total rewrite in C. It is
		like the earlier versions in spirit only. There are sure to
		be lots of bugs, and there is no support for configurable
		menu colors in this version. However, it's now MUCH faster,
		and easier to use, with loads of new options.

0.2	The enevitable bugfix				02DEC95
		Added support for multiple menu files being used at once.
			Just specify them all as parameters.
		Got rid of the width item in the menu definitions.
		Because of conflicts with multiple other programs named
			"menu", the Makefile now installs it as pdmenu
			instead. See INSTALL for details.
		Added support for different colored menus.
		Added a background title to the menus.
		Fixed bug in detection of menus.
