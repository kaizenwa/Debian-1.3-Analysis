                        Compilation and Installation

Libraries:	
	To compile Pdmenu, you need the S-Lang library. This can be 
	found at ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/

	Optionally, if you wish to compile pdmenu with mouse support, you
	need to install the GPM library. Find it on a linux ftp site near 
	you.

Configuration:
	Pdmenu uses an autoconf configure script. Typically, if you want
	the pdmenu binary installed in /usr/bin, and the pdmenurc file
	installed in /etc, you should type:

		./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

	To get a list of all the possible arguments the configure script can
	use, type:

		./configure --help

	Note that if you have slang installed in a nonstandard location, you 
	might need to set two variables before you are run ./configure in 
	the next step:

		SLANG_LIB_LOC	Set this to the directory where the slang
				libraries are located.
		SLANG_H_LOC	Set this to the filename where slang.h is
				located.

Compilation:
	Pdmenu has been compiled on many flavors of Unix, and also on AIX.
	You shouldn't have any problems with those OS's,  but for others,
	you're on your own. If you get it to work on something  else, 
	please let me know.

	To build Pdmenu, type:

		make

Testing:
	To try out the program before installing it, type:
	
		make test

Installation:
	To install Pdmenu, become root and type:

		make install
