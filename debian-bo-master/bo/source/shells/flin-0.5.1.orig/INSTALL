The binary supplied is i486-unknown-linux (ELF). It should compile and run
under other operating systems without hassle. It has been tested on:

	* Linux
	* AIX
	* Solaris x86 2.4

Feel free to add more to the list (my only request is that you notify me when
you do).

For people with ELF:
	There is a binary supplied, linked against libc version 5.2.9 which
	includes ncurses v1.9.4 as the curses/termcap library.

	If you don't have the access to the private directory, you'll have to
	make it yourself, read the instructions below.

Making from sources:
	First, run `configure', see the file `README.Configure' for details on
	command line options.

	Then edit `config.h' then `Makefile' to suit your needs.

	Then type `make', it should compile without any warnings or errors.
	Try it out on the supplied `test.menu', if it doesn't work please tell
	me what's wrong, and if you are so inclined, have a look at the source
	and try to fix it.

	If it compiles and runs, type `make install' to install it in
	/usr/local/bin (or wherever you set your prefix to).
