Introduction
------------
	Flin is a menuing system with fvwm-like syntax.

Menu Structure
--------------
	A menu is defined by a list of items contained inside the tokens `Menu' and `EndMenu', it
can have any amount of items, each defined by TOKEN:LIST:ARGS, where TOKEN
defines what the item does, LIST is how the item appears in the menu, and ARGS
are the arguments to the Token. Some Tokens don't require arguments, some do,
see the Token definition to find out.

Menu Tokens
-----------
	A menu token is a token which has a visible effect on the menu, such
as displaying items.

Currently, Flin supports the following menu tokens:

	Title
	Nop
	SubMenu
	Exec
	Exit
	Quit

Title inserts a non-selectable title line in the menu. Syntax:
	Title:Name:

Nop inserts a non-selectable line in the menu, when blank will produce a line. Syntax:
	Nop:Name:
	   or
	Nop::

SubMenu creates a link to another menu named in the ARGS field. Syntax:
	SubMenu:Name:Menu name:

Exec executes the ARGS field. Syntax:
	Exec:Name:command line:

Exit exits the current menu, returning to the previous menu. If Exit is
executed in the first menu loaded Flin will quit. Syntax:
	Exit:Name:

Quit logs out of Flin. Syntax:
	Quit:Name:
