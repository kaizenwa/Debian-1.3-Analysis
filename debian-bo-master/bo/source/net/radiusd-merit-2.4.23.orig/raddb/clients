#
#	This file contains a list of clients which are allowed to
#	make authentication requests and their encryption keys.
#
#	The first field may be an IP address or a valid DNS hostname.
#
#	The second field (separated by blanks or tabs) is the encryption
#	key.  It is currently limited to fifteen (15) characters in length.
#
#	The prefix field specifies a prefix which can be used to select
#	different users files and authfile files to be used for requests
#	from the associated client.
#
#	The "<name1>/<name2>" style entries may be used to specify the pair
#	of servers for which an entry applies.  This allows the same clients
#	file to be used by and distributed to different RADIUS servers.
