.SH DESCRIPTION
.B papd
is the AppleTalk printer daemon.  This daemon accepts print jobs from
AppleTalk clients (typically Macintosh computers) using the Printer
Access Protocol (PAP).
.B papd
spools jobs directly into an
.BR lpd (8)
spool directory and wakes up
.B lpd
after accepting a job from the network to have it re-examine the
appropriate spool directory.  The actual printing and spooling is
handled entirely by
.B lpd.
.LP
.B papd
is typically started at boot time, out of
.B /etc/rc.
It first reads from its configuration file,
.BR :ETCDIR:/papd.conf .
The file is in the same format as
.BR /etc/printcap .
See
.BR printcap (5)
for details.  The name of the entry is registered with
.BR NBP .
There are currently three supported capabilities.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following papd configuration file sets up two print spoolers for the
.B lpd
printers named
.B ps
and
.BR lp .
The first spooler is known by the NBP name
.B Mac Printer Spooler,
and uses a PPD file located in
.B /usr/share/lib/ppd.
In addition, the user
.B mcs
will be the owner of all jobs that are spooled.
The second spooler is known as
.B HP Printer
and all options are the default.

Printer capabilities database.

.B .ppd
PostScript Printer Description file.
.B papd
answers configuration and font queries from printing clients by
consulting the configured PPD file.  Such files are available from
Adobe, Inc, via anonymous ftp from ftp.adobe.com in /pub/adobe/PPDfiles
(ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/PPDfiles), or from the printer's
manufacturer.  If no PPD file is configured,
.B papd
will return the default answer, possibly causing the client to send
excessively large jobs.

.SH CAVEATS
.I papd
accepts characters with the high bit set (a full 8-bits) from the clients,
but some PostScript printers (including Apple Computer's LaserWriter family)
only accept 7-bit characters on their serial interface by default.  You will
need to configure your printer to accept a full 8 bits.
