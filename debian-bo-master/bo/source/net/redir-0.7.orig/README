Redir v.0.7

redir is a tcp port redirector for unix.
It can run under inetd or stand alone (in which case it handles
multiple connections).  Its 8 bit clean, not limited to line
mode, is small and light.

If you want access control run it under xinetd, or inetd with tcp
wrappers.  Or you could use the tcp wrapper library to extend it and
do fancy access control - if so please let me know.

redir is released under GPL.

[Original readme from version 0.5]

If you liked daemon, you'll LOVE redir!

Redir, the fully functional (but only in line mode) port redirector for 
unix!  (yeah!  WOOOO!).  Basically, it's like tredir.   But hacked from 
daemon.  And poorly written.   But, hey, it dodges firewalls, and THAT's 
the important part.  I think.  Oh, fuck it.  Look, it's useful.   Good 
for dynamic IP, too.   Trust me, it is.

usage: redir [remote-host] listen_port connect_port

The syntax is a little clumsy, but it works. 

compile with make redir or gcc redir.c -o redir
