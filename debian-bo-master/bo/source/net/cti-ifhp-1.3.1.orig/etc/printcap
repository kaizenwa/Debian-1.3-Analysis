Assumptions:
   We assume we are talking to a HP IV printer, ecepr3,
   it us using a Jetdirect card which allows a direct printer
   connection on port 9100.
   We have installed the filter software;
    /usr/local/lib/ifhp - filter
    /usr/local/lib/ofhp - symbolic link to ifhp
    /usr/local/lib/banner.sh - PCL banner printer
    /usr/local/lib/accounting.sh - accounting shell

Version 1:
    by default, the ofhp will print a banner using information on the
    short banner line and/or parameters passed by LPRng.

# LPRng printcap files
# HP LaserJet 4m+
lw4|lp|HP LaserJet 4M Plus on the Net:
# job size information
    :mx#0
# spool directory
    :sd=/usr/spool/cca_4mp:
# device network address
    :lp=ecepr3%9100
    :rw
# set up status and accounting files
    :sf=status
    :af=acct
    :lf=log
# page information size (PCL only)
    :pl#60:pw#80:
# for banner printing you need SHORT BANNER
# the LPRng system allows you to specify the banner line as well
    :sb
    :bl=Seq\: $-'j  Class\: $-'C User\: $-'n Job\: $-'J Date\: $-'t
# turn FF off
    :sf
# filters - remember of filter invoked with -Fo
    :if=/usr/local/lib/ifhp
    :of=/usr/local/lib/ofhp
#

Version 2:
   You want to have a special banner, so you specify the BP filter:

  REMOVE:
   :sb           (you want full banners)
  ADD:
   :bp=/usr/local/lib/banner.sh   (with this banner printer)
  CHANGE
   :of=/usr/local/lib/ofhp -Tbanner=off  (and no banner here)

Version 3:
   Printer is on /dev/ttya serial line. Note: the stty options
   are taken from an actual functioning printer connection and
   should work for HP printer on a serial line)

   CHANGE:
    :lp=/dev/ttya
   ADD:
    :sy=38400 -echo -crmod -raw -oddp -evenp pass8 cbreak ixon

Version 4:
   you do not want banner pages at all!

   ADD:
   :sh           (suppress headers - i.e. - no banner lines)
