CTI-ifhp-1.3.1
    Editted the syslog() call to have it report ALTER information.
      Printer alert and other messages now reported by default, but you
      can turn them off using -DQUIET compile time or -Tquiet option
    Fixed missing declarations and some portability issues.

CTI-ifhp-1.2.10
    Banner printing facility updated and commented.  Added README.banner,
      banner.sh and psbanner.sh to distribution.

CTI-ifhp-1.2.9
	Bugs in the radical rewrite of the Z options (1.2.9).
     - Postscript still ignores -Zlandscape on HP LJ4M+ ...sigh

CTI-ifhp-1.2.8
	A radical rewrite of the Zoptions and setup code for the
	printer.  You can now have landscape, duplex, etc .etc.,
	hopefully with PJL, etc.
	(Inspired by: goldberg@informatik.uni-hildesheim.de (Markus Goldberg))
CTI-ifhp-1.2.7
    Added code to removed quotes around parameters passed to the
      accounting filter.
      (From: Per Foreby <perf@efd.lth.se>)
	Fixed up the accounting script to handle -Z options correctly.

CTI-ifhp-1.2.6
    Added '-Zsimplex' option support for simplex printing.
    (Michel Robitaille <robitail@IRO.UMontreal.CA>)
    do_monitor() - HP5SiMX printer returns codes 11xxxx, which are informative
    but not serious.   Added check for these codes.
     (Per Foreby <perf@efd.lth.se>)

CTI-ifhp-1.2.5
    FONTS:  the -Tdefaultfont=name or -Tdefaultfont=/path flag now
    specifies the default font to be downloaded.  The default is now
    NONE - i.e. - we do not download a font.
    (Carl Hilton <chilton@dns2.sac.usace.army.mil>)

CTI-ifhp-1.2.4
    Added check for sys_siglist[] declaration
    configure, configure.in, config.h - new versions

CTI-ifhp-1.2.3
    check added in 1.2.2 to see if stdout is readable did not work
      on many systems.  Modified to use 'fcntl' instead.

CTI-ifhp-1.2.2
    (Changes suggested/recommended by Per Foreby <perf@efd.lth.se>)
    do_accnt() - put quotes '' around options to be compatible with LPRng
      acounting file format.
    -H (fully qualified hostname) missing from accounting information
    HP5 error code 10023 now does not print error message.
    Version information (version.h) updated.
    man page hpif.1 updated.
    added code 10029 'processing jobs' to the list of codes
    check to see if stdout is readable. If not, suppress getting status.
      This allows use of filter in a pipe much easier.

CTI-ifhp-1.2.1
    fnt_scan() routine was not finding the required font file.
     (Panos Dimakopoulos dimakop@cti.gr)

CTI-ifhp-1.2.0
    updated checks for status values - status value 10000 - 10999
      considered safe now.
    -Tlogall causes all messages from the printer to be sent to the
      log file.  This is helpful when trying to debug faulty printers.

CTI-ifhp-1.1.9
    Fixed some minor problems with synchronizing to the printer
    when it is put off line.
    Changed timeouts from fixed to increasing values with maximums.
    For example, timeouts now start at 1 sec, and then double to
    a maximum value.  This improves throughput.
    Forced the filter to wait until the last page of the job has
    been completed and the printer is ready for a new job.  This forces
    page count to be reported correctly on HP LJ4.  However, you get
    a 4-5 second pause between jobs.  Can't have everything and page
    accounting as well, it seems.

CTI-ifhp-1.1.8
    Bob Beck <beck@cs.ualberta.ca> tracked down a nasty problem
    which comes up when you read from a closed pipe.
    This resulted in a slew of changes,  each cascading to more
    fiddles.  I finally rewrote much of the status getting and
    reporting code.  At this point,  there should be no race conditions,
    and the monitor process should get killed on exit.

CTI-ifhp-1.1.7
    Better status reading from the printer - fatal error
    if status requested and printer connection cannot be read.
    Added monitoring capability - write a message to the remote
    system using UPD.
    Optional user level accounting script.

CTI-ifhp-1.1.6
    Page count is not supported on some HP LaserJet printers.
     As a fallback, try using PostScript to see if it is available.
    Fixed documentation about banner printing and printcap entries

CTI-ifhp-1.1.5
    Improved error reporting and logging.

CTI-ifhp-1.1.4
    Fixed up some problems with timeouts,  now use
    'correct' SVR4 type of signal handlers.

CTI-ifhp-1.1.3 - Baseline Release
  Sat Nov  4 15:17:28 PST 1995
  Updated the configure.in file to set SVR4 for some fussy stuff.

CTI-ifhp-1.1.3 - Baseline Release
