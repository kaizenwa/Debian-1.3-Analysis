.SH DESCRIPTION
The IPX RIP/SAP daemon 
.B ipxd
is invoked at boot time to manage the kernel IPX routing tables.

When ipxd is started, it scans the file /proc/net/ipx_interfaces to
find the ipx networks the computer is directly connected to. It sends
the RIP and SAP response and request packets required by the IPX
router specification v1.20 to the interfaces it found, so that an
initial RIP and SAP table can be built. 

During normal operation, ipxd listens on the RIP and SAP ports of each
directly connected interface for broadcasts that other routers on the
network send out, as well as requests issued by workstations. This way
the full router functionality required by the IPX router specification
v1.20 is hopefully implemented.

Every 30 seconds, as well as on request by a HUP signal, the file
/proc/net/ipx_interfaces is re-scanned. Changes in the network
topology are detected this way and broadcasted appropriately. This
could eventually make Linux a quite flexible IPX router.

.SH OPTIONS
.B -d
.RS 3
With option 
.B -d,
ipxd does not daemonize itself and logs the IPX traffic it receives
and sends out to the log file.
.RE

.B -p
.RS 3
With option
.B -p,
ipxd works in passive mode. This means it does not output any response
on the net. It does not broadcast its internal tables, and does not
answer requests. This makes it suitable for use in a normal IPX
workstation, which should not act as a router. By starting ipxd in
passive mode, the kernel routing tables are kept up to date. This
means that utilities like slist or nprint do not have to run suid
root, to be able to add IPX routing table entries.

It is not possible to use ipxd in passive mode when you have an
internal net, because other IPX nodes must know how to reach the
internal net. They can only know it if ipxd tells them where the
internal net is.
.RE


.B -l
.I logfile
.RS 3
With this option you can tell ipxd where to put its log output. The
default is /dev/null. 
.RE

.B -t
.I ticks_file
.RS 3
With this option you can override the default file name for the ticks
file. The default is /etc/ipx_ticks. See ipx_ticks(5) for more
information.
