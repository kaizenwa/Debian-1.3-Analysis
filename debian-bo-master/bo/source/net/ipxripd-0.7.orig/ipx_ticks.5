.TH IPX_TICKS 5 "IPX Utilities" "Volker Lendecke"
.SH NAME
ipx_ticks \- Configuration file for ipxd
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/ipx_ticks

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B ipx_ticks
file contains the configuration information required by ipxd, the IPX
RIP/SAP daemon.

The RIP/SAP daemon can find out nearly all information it needs to run
properly by scanning the file /proc/net/ipx_interfaces, and by asking
other routers and servers on the net. The only information it can not
get this way is the time it takes to send a packet over the different
interfaces. This information is required by the IPX RIP protocol. It
is specified in so-called ticks, which is about 55 ms per tick.

The format of this file is very simple. On each line of the file the
tick value for a physical interface is specified. The first field is
the name of the interface, and the ticks value follows after a
white-space.  Empty lines as well as lines starting with '#' are
ignored. A possible example is the following:

   # Tick values for IPX interfaces
   #
   # device name    ticks value
   eth0             1
   ppp0             7


The default ticks value for devices not specified in /etc/ipx_ticks is
1.
