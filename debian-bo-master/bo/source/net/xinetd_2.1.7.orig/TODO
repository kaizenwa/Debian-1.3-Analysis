Things to work on for the new ports:

1) Add shutdown functions for services as needed.

2) FTP has been observed to cause a segmentation fault under Linux during
	SATAN scans. This happens when the FTP server forks/sec limit is
	reached. This does not cause insecure or unstable behavior; it only
	causes the child xinetd process to abort. Cause is Linux' lack of
	support for struct sigcontext and friends.

3) The current release of xinetd-2.1.7 logs a warning to the syslog 
	LOG_WARNING facility if a logfile is found to be a symlink. Please be
	aware that, in general, you are in serious trouble if your xinetd logs
	get changed to symlinks, as root permission is usually required to do
	this. To monitor runtime state changes to the logfiles, a separate
	daemon would be a better answer than added code in xinetd which can
	impact performance on heavily loaded systems.

	For now, the safe bet is to log to syslog (see README.SBC).
