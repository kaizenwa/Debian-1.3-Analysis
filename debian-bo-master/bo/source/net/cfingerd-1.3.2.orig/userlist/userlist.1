.TH USERLIST 8 "24 Sep 1996" "userlist 0.0.1" "Finger\-type Userlisting"
.SH NAME
userlist \- Userlisting of who's on your system.
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B userlist
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program simply gives you a listing of who is connected to your 
system.  It is used primarily in the sorted listing of
.Br cfingerd ,
which 
utilitizes the same method of display for a more uniform output between 
systems.  (It also made more sense to do it this way instead of having 
jumbled up display listings in sorted finger displays.  Besides, it made 
more sense to do this than use finger.  :)
.PP
This program functions with the same types of things in mind that 
.B cfingerd
does.  If the user has a
.I .nofinger
file, their username will 
not be displayed in the userlisting.
.PP
Example output is shown as:
.sp
 Username Real Name      Idletime TTY Remote console
 username I'm real ...   9d 23:59   0 (remote.site.com)
.PP
where it would display the user's login name, the user's real name, their 
idle time given in the format "dd hh:mm", their TTY, and their remote 
location (or where they're telnetting from).
.PP
If the username is over 8 characters, the program will not search for 
their information in the passwd file, since it may be too long.  Besides, 
it checks getpwnam, anyway.  :)
.br
.SH ADDITIONAL
Although userlist is not required to run as suid root, it is a good idea.
The reason is it checks each users' directory for a ".nofinger" file.  If
indeed that user has a ".nofinger" file in his/her directory, that user
will not be shown in the userlisting.
.PP
If you change the program to run as nobody.nobody, you are free to do so.
But you will also show the users if they are online, regardless of whether
or not they have a ".nofinger" file (as long as their directory is
NOT world-readable.)
