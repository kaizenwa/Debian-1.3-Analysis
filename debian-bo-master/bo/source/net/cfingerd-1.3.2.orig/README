   Become superuser.  (This can be done by typing "su".  :)

   Type "./Configure".  This will ask you a few questions on what setup your
   system has.  You will be prompted a couple of questions.  Simply answer
   them, and you should be set.  (Any wrong data in the setup could lead
   to a strangely performing finger daemon.)

   Type "make all".  This will start creating the new finger daemon for
   your system, and should compile through just fine.  (Ignore any warnings
   if there are any on your system.)

   ************************************************************************
   *** READ THIS NEXT SET OF LINES CAREFULLY!  FAILURE TO ADD THIS LINE ***
   *** TO YOUR INETD.CONF FILE WILL NOT CHANGE YOUR CURRENT FINGER!!!!! ***
   ************************************************************************

   Now, edit /etc/inetd.conf with your favorite text editor.  You need to
   insert the following line:

finger	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/tcpd	/usr/sbin/in.cfingerd

   (The reason the configuration script does NOT do this is because many
    versions of inetd.conf can vary greatly.)

   Save your new inetd.conf file, and restart it.  This can be accomplished
   by typing "killall -HUP inetd".

   Now, type "finger @".  This will spawn cfingerd through inetd as another
   user would see it from within your domain.  To test what it would look
   like from another domain, simply telnet to another machine, and finger
   your system from that machine.

   After you've noted what you want changed, simply edit /etc/cfingerd.conf,
   or wherever you moved the file.  Now, you can make the necessary
   modifications to the file as you need.
