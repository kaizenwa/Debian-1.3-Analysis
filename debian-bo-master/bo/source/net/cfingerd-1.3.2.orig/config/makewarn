You already have a previously created Makefile, meaning you have run this
configuration script once before.  If you want to go ahead and re-run the
configuration script, simply reply with "Y" to continue and re-make the
makefile.  Otherwise, reply with "N" and type "make clean" manually
before running the Configuration script again.
