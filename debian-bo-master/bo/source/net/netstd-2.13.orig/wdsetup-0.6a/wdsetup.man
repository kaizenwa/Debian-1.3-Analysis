       Wdsetup is used to configure the i/o address, interrupt line,
       ram size, ram base address, wait states, network connection,
       rom size, and rom base  address. In  the command line option
       method, wdsetup  works silently, and  returns 0 for success,
       or -1  if an error occured. The board is re-configured, and
       the soft eeprom configuration is unchanged. In the inter-
       active method, the current configuration is displayed, and
       then the user is promped for the new configuration to put
       in to the eeprom. If your jumpers are not set to soft/soft,
       both current and soft configuration information will be shown.

       Note that the W1 and W2 jumpers must be set to "soft" to use
       the eeprom configuration on boot-up.

       1. wdsetup must be run as root.
       2. Do not re-configure your card while the network
          software is accessing it.
       3. You may see "warning eeprom checksum error"
          if your card has not been used with the latest SMC
          ezsetup, or wdsetup before. This is normal, and the
          message will not appear after you update the soft
          configuration in eeprom. (The old SMC ezsetup and
          wdsetup did not have a master checksum). This mess-
          age will only appear on cards with 82C584 BIC.

       0. Since this program has not been widely tested, it
          would be wise to have the Dos(yuck) ezsetup program
          handy in case something goes wrong.

       1. If there is a problem with the auto recognition,
          use -a 280 (replace 280 with your card's actual address).

       2. It seems that some cards (not necessarily ethernet cards)
          may lockup if you read their registers at the wrong time,
          so if you have such cards, you must specify the address
          of your card using the wdsetup -a option, otherwise the
          autodetect feature may lockup your computer.
