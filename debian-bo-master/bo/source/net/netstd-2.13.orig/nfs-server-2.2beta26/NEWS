Changes from 2.0 to 2.2

* Fixed a fair number of bugs.
* authenticate fh's on every request.
* Use setfsuid/setfsgid if available for setting owner/group on file
  access rather than seteuid.
* Implement root_squash and no_root_squash mount options. Note: root_squash
  is on by default, so you have to insert no_root_squash where appropriate
  or your configuration might break.
* New set of uid squash options: squash_uids, squash_gids (specify
  list of uids/gids to squash), all_squash, anon_uid and anon_gid
  (override uid/gid of anon user for specific clients), noaccess (exclude
  subdirectories).
* Uid/gid mapping using Mark Shand's ugidd.
* Different log levels for debugging.
* Manpages updated to reflect the current set of defaults.
* Patch to perform per-call profiling of the server.
* Netgroup support in /etc/exports.
* mountd now support /etc/rmtab and showmount -a.
* export file re-reading with SIGHUP in nfsd and mountd.
* Support for multiple nfsd's running in parallel (read-only).
* Interactive BUILD script.
* Added new host format to exports file; you can now use network/mask to
  export a volume to an entire IP subnetwork.
* Added selective uid/gid squashing and cleint-specific nobody uid/gid
  to exports file.
* Added noaccess option in exports file.
* Added rpc.rquotad

Changes from version 1.5 to 2.0:

* new configuration based on autoconf and GNU standards
* showmount doesn't mangle the output of exports to (everybody)
* the symlink bug in mountd is REALLY fixed this time
* all programs support long options
* create works correctly on non-files
* mknod is now fully supported
* execute only programs now work correctly
* mentioning a client twice in the exports file doesn't cause looping
* rogue clients cannot search past a mount point
* both read-only and read-write filesystems can be exported to the same client
