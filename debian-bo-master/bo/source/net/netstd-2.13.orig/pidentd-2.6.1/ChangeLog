	* Release version 2.6.1

		(#ifdef SOLARIS24_WORKAROUND)

	* Released version 2.6

	* Added support for SCO Unix 3.2v4.2 and v5 (Vic Abell)

	* Added support for Sequent PTX/2 and PTX/4 (Tim Wright)

	* Updated the FreeBSD support (Torsten Blum)

	* some Solaris cosmetic changes.

	* Added a STRONG_LOG compile-time option.

	* Added SO_REUSEADDR socket option before bind()

	* Made the daemon not fork()-and-detach from controlling TTY
	  if started in debug mode (-d)

	* Added a workaround to the Solaris 2.4 problem with running
	  the daemon in standalone or "wait" modes (that the Solaris KVM
	  library caches more information than it should). The workaround
	  is that it opens/rescans and closes the KVM for every call. Slow
	  but...

	* Added compile time&date output to the VERSION request.
