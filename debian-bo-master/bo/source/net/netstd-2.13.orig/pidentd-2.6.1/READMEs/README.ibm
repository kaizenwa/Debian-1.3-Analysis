Here are some tips&tricks for IBM users,
from Chris Moller (moller@vnet.ibm.com, moller@futserv.austin.ibm.com):

"Under IBM weirdness, after you modify /etc/services or /etc/inetd.conf,
you have to update the ODM by running, from root, the following:

        inetimp
        chrctcp -S -c inetd -f debug='no' -f file='/etc/inetd.conf'

or the changes don't take effect.  Other than that, everything worked
fine out of the box."
