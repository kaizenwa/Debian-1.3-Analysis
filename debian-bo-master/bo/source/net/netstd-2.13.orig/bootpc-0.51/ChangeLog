Tidy up rc.bootp script to use "hostname -S" and "mv -f", when setting
up the resolver code.
JSP 23/02/94

Added the in2host code to bootpc.c (new --in2host option) and reworked
rc.bootp to use this to get the DOMAIN if the bootp reply doesn't set
it following discussion with bootp server manager about meaning of
DOMAIN field being unclear.  This code attempts to guess the DOMAIN
from the gethostbyaddr() lookup for the IP address by removing the
leaf component.  Also tidied up code a little, bumped version to 0.20.
JSP 17/02/94

Fix bug in TAG 1 handling (added wrong increment to cookie counter),
also fixed handling of TAGs 128 to 254 as per RFC1497.
JSP 27/05/94

Fix default boot image to ask for from "linux" to "", since it was
reported to cause problems.
JSP 17/06/94

Fix for new kernels change low level ifreq.ifr_hwaddr changes.
JSP 18/06/94

Added --server <address> option to allow better testing and in case
anyone wants to force the lookup from a particular server, or a
particular network (it might just happen...)
JSP 18/06/94

Rewrite large chunks of rc.bootp to take account of changes suggested
by various people (setting up loopback, and tidying up the code.
JSP 18/06/94

Changed detection of NET3 code as suggested by A.Cox, added extra checks
for device being ethernet type (on NET3 only) which is only type currently
supported.
JSP 20/06/94

Removed old -S option from hostname command in rc.bootp and rearranged
a few lines.  Changed rc.bootp to use --server anyway (as an example.)
Changed --in2host to generate DONEIN2HOST line and changed rc.bootp
accordingly.
JSP 20/06/94

Added -m486 to the CFLAGS line in the Makefile.
JSP 20/06/94

Minor tidyups to comments in rc.bootp and bootpc.c for next release (which
is very late!)
JSP 16/08/94

Added new --hwaddr option to ask for a MAC address other than ours
(doesn't work on some (most?) bootp servers since they reply to the MAC
address quoted not to the one we sent from.)
JSP 17/08/94

Fixed rc.bootp to remove the route it makes before taking the network down
after the bootp request.  This is just cleanliness.
JSP 18/08/94

Added code to FatalError() to print the errno and a message about the
looping is --debug is set.
JSP 18/08/94

Added new WHEN-IT-FAILS file with some information on how to look for
common problems and report faults with the bootpc code.
JSP 18/08/94

Added code to cat an existing hosts.local file onto the end of hosts
in the rc.bootp.
JSP 06/09/94

Merged in SLIP special case code from ramana@VNET.IBM.COM
JSP 27/09/94

Added alpha version of ping sanity test code to bootpc.
JSP 28/09/94

Added searchpath stuff for new resolver support, and checked it works
at least for .ac.uk sites (well for us anyway.)
JSP 28/09/94

Rewrote MAC address handling to just use the NET3 features where
available and removed the SLIP code (which broke ethernet usage.)
JSP 28/09/94

Removed some broken code from the ping routine and fixed a minor
problem with it's packet setup.
JSP 07/10/94

Rewrote rc.bootp code for paranoid checks to use the NETWORK address
as the sender when performing the pings as we don't see any replies if
we send from 0.0.0.0 (something wrong somewhere else.)
JSP 08/10/94

Corrected my e-mail address to our new official one (Rah Rah!!) :-)
JSP 08/10/94

Rolled in patches from "Andre Schroeter" <A.Schroeter@DKFZ-Heidelberg.de>
about the TAG_TIME_OFFSET, TAG_BOOTSIZE, and bootfile stuff, and fixed the
rc.bootp accordingly.
JSP 27/02/95

Added fix from B.A.McCauley@bham.ac.uk to set the "broadcast reply"
flag when sending out for a MAC address other than our own.  According
to the RFC1542 a bootp server should broadcast the reply when this is
set so we can still pick it up.  Doesn't work with some broken bootp
servers though.
JSP 02/04/95

Minor typos corrected and version bumped up to v0.44.  Some more
testing done (few live tests at moment).  Updated README to mention
that DIP does native bootp for those who want bootp and DIP.
JSP 28/06/95

Added ARCNET patch from Tomasz Motylewski <motyl@tichy.ch.uj.edu.pl> which
doesn't follow the convention about hardware addresses (at least not when
talking to a Novell Server.  Bumped version to v0.45.
JSP 1995-08-02

Fixed TAG_SWAP_SERVER to add correct offset, and fix the code the an
unknown TAG as suggested by Peter Wong Jr <pitz@engg.upd.edu.ph>
JSP 1995-08-11

Added patches for new TAGs from Charles Lopes <tjarls@Infm.Ulst.AC.UK>,
changed the cookie parser to take the lenth code out of the switch.  Added
2 new options --returniffails and --timeoutwait to cause bootpc to return
if it can't find an address and to set how long in total (roughly) to wait
in seconds.  Fixed the rc.bootp code for setting up the hosts file.
JSP 1995-09-08

Removed -m486 from makefile CFLAGS since we may not be on a 486 anymore.
JSP 1995-12-20

Finally removed old NET2 code (need NET3 now), and bumped up version to
0.48 ready for new release.  Also changed some "long"s to "int32"s.
JSP 1995-12-21

Changed bootpc code for printing options out to be more careful about
printing characters which might cause problems for the thing reading the
output.  Also tidied up code for generating a DNS search string, and
updated WHEN-IT-FAILS to mention more stuff, and updated rc.bootp to cope
with --returniffail etc.  Bumped version number up to 0.49.
JSP 1996-03-11

Added distrib target to Makefile, and put everything under RCS to stop me
losing more edits!
JSP 1996-04-16

Fixed a couple of bugs in cleanup of bootpc.c relating to "waitformore"
handling.  It still doesn't wait exactly as long as you ask, but this is a
minore problem.  Bumped version numbers of everything to V0.50.  I'll need
to write a man page soon!

Removed test in bptypes.h for 32/63 bitness as it apparently didn't work
on alphas anyway.  Trust that int is 32bits for now.  Also fixes a couple
of %d to %ld in printf's.
JSP 1996-04-17

Changed make distrib to keep version numbers consistent, see VERSION for
version number now.
JSP 1996-04-17
