.SH NAME
S/key \-  A proceedure to use one time passwords for accessing computer systems.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I S/key
is a proceedure for using one time password to authenticate access to
compter systems. It uses 64 bits of information transformed by the
MD4 algorithm. The user supplies the 64 bits in the form of 6 English
words that are generated by a secure computer. Eg a pocket sized smart
card or a PC/Macintosh, or a machine at work and printed on a sheet of
paper.
Example use of the S/key program 
.I key
.sp
  Usage example:
.sp 0
 	>key  99 th91334
.sp 0
 	Enter password: <your secret password is intered here>
.sp 0
 	OMEN US HORN OMIT BACK AHOY
.sp 0
 	>
.sp
The programs that are part of the S/Key system are keyinit, key,
keyinfo, keysu, and keylogin. Keyinit is used to get your ID set up, key is
used to get the onetime password each time,
keyinfo is used to extract information from the S/Key database
and the rest are system routines.
For Lab 214 you must use keyinit on system latour and then telnet to
system latour.bellcore.com (IP address 128.96.41.50) or if using dial\-in
you will routed to system cube for S/Key by the security system.
Use keyinit \-s ( for secure option) if you are doing the set up
over insecure communications lines. These are telnet from outside
Bellcore and MICOM dialin from off the Bellcore premises.
.sp
When you do "keyinit" you inform the system of your
secret password.  Running "key" then generates the
one-time passwords, and also requires your secret
password.  If however, you misspell your password
while running "key", you will get a list of passwords
that will not work, and no indication about the problem.
.sp
Password reference numbers count backward from 99.  If you
don't know this, the syntax for "key" will be confusing.
.sp
When typing in your one-time password to gain access to
latour, backspace (^H) can be used to make corrections.
You can enter the passwords using small letters, even
though the "key" program gives them in caps.
When you run "key -n 10 `keyinfo` | lpr", and you do not
find your printout at the printer, or in the bin of your
login, or in the bin of your last name, or on the floor
or any place else, you have a problem.  Someone has accidentally
or purposefully acquired a list of one-time passwords and
your login (on the cover sheet) which give them access to
your account. 
The only remedy is to run "keyinit" again but you do NOT have to
change your secret password since the system will change the
initial "key" for you.  Now the missing information
is useless.
.sp
It would be nice if the system had a way for you to advance
(i.e. decrement) the counter in the database, so you could
invalidate all the passwords you printed but this is not possible
because of the algorithm.
.sp
Note the notion that one could remember a list of lists of 6 quasi-english
words without writing them down
is ridiculous.  However, sending them to a printer without immediately
retrieving the output is a big security hole.
.sp
Macintosh and a general purpose PC use
are available. You may "download" them from the
directory /usr/local/lib/key.
