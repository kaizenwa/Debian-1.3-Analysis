Ok - it's finally working! The little clues added up, especially
your hint above. Here's a summary of my changes to a system with
no ethernet, wanting to use dip, TIA for SLIP emulation and Linux
version of netscape.

1. Add to /etc/hosts - the name of my service provider like this:
   204.50.2.2 mars.ark.com mars

   This allows me to use get $remote mars in Dip.

2. Add to /etc/resolv.conf - my service provider's IP address like this:
   nameserver 204.50.2.2

3. I haven't written the dip script yet, but here is how I connect:
   As root from an X shell:
   dip -tv
 > port cua1
 > get $local darkstar
 > get $remote mars
 > get $mtu 296
 > dial txxxxxxx
 > term (switch to term and manually login...)
~$ tia
   ...gives a message about tia, ready to start SLIP
   ctrl-] back to dip
 > default
 > mode SLIP
   ...gives a message about slip interface and returns to system prompt
 # netscape &

 Now I'm happily free from the MS Windows version of netscape.
 I'm told that the termified version of netscape is faster, so I
 may have to try that next.

 Thanks for your help with this Uri...
