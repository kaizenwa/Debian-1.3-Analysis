CHANGES to rpc.rstatd

1. rpc.rstatd now correctly reports time and uptime

HOW TO INSTALL rpc.rstatd

1. Unpack the distribution file rstatd_patched.tar.gz

2. Edit Makefile for appropriate destination directory /sbin or /etc
   (rename or copy any existing rpc.rstatd or rstatd - just in case)

3. Kill any running rpc.rstatd or rstatd daemon
   > kill -9 your_pid

4. make install		(will fail if you miss 3 above)
   This installs three files:
     /usr/include/rstat.h
     /usr/lib/librpcsrv.a
     /sbin/rpc.rstatd or /etc/rpc.rstatd
		
5. run the new daemon
   > /sbin/rpc.rstatd &
   or
   > /etc/rpc.rstatd &	(Don't forget the &)

5. Add rpc.rstatd to the list of net daemons started AFTER rpc.portmap
   IT IS VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO FORGET THE "&" OR YOU WILL HANG LINUX 
   AT BOOT TIME ......You do have a boot floppy don't you :-)
