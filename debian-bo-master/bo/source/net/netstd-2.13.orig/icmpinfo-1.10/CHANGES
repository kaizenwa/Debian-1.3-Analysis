IcmpInfo - Version history  - by dl
===================================
1.10- Applied Arnt Gulbrandsen <agulbra@nvg.unit.no> fix for fixing 
      conversion from net order to host order for little-endian machines
      (thanks!). Added warning about domain loops in README.
1.9 - Added a new port number->service name decoding, and option -p to disable
      this decoding. Changed print.c to remove [-no name-] and get a nicer
      and shorter output when there is no name for ip or it is not aksed
      for (-n). removed openlog&syslog check, 'cause some unixes don't
      have a retcode for these functions :/. Improved the doc & manpage.
      fixed typo source quence -> quench. fixed typo sp= twice.
1.8 - better syslog error proofing.
      now prevents ip decoding for icmps echo (pings) where it meant nothing
      (change visible only with -vv). added a test so -l option is
      usable by root only. added -s (for hosts with more than one interface).
      updated documentation.
1.7 - added support .h for linux - fixed .man
1.6 - rewrote long & buggy error.c into simple err.c - added new icmps
      compiles on netbsd, ...
1.5 - added fflush - added syslog -l option
1.4 - fixed a bug in the dump (unsigned/signed char problem) - added hdrlen
1.3 - included a good hex/ascii dump for -vvv - various improvments (main)
1.2 - works good, added -n (no name query) , 3 levels of -v - Makefile
1.1 - minimal version, dumps core on sun's because of bugs in bsd source!
1.0 - first hack in ping source to get some icmp info
