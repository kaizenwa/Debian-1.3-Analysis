This is Version 2.0.2 of sliplogin based on Berkeley's sliplogin
version 5.6 and Florian La Roche's sliplogin version 1.6.

Jan Wedekind (jan@todonix.ping.de) has ported sliplogin to
FreeBSD and will merge our two versions 'soon'.

Sliplogin works with a shadowized linux (-lshadow) and
it works even when mgetty is calling /bin/login.
You really should use mgetty0.21 or newer for your incoming calls since
it fixes a signal 'bug' , you don't have to set your modem to auto-answer
and you can receive fax on the same line.

NOTES
=====
The PID argument for slip.login has been done to help you to enable
absolute timeouts, but you can aswell specify an idle timeout
in slip.hosts.
Be sure to use the newest (depending on your kernel version) net-tools,
which can be found in the sunacm directory on sunsite.unc.edu mirrors.

INSTALLING
==========
Edit the Makefile to suit your environment which means
especially comment -lshadow if you don't use shadow and
set SLIPGROUP to an existing group. You can choose between
three different output messages to appear on the slip user's screen;
either the normal message (which displays the client IP first)
or the old message (which displays the server IP first) or a funny
message (which displays the client IP first).
After editing the Makefile as root type 'make' and if you get no error, type
'make install'.
Read the manual (man sliplogin) on how to setup a slip account.
In the sliplogin package there are some example files, namely
passwd, slip.hosts, slip.login* and slip.logout*.
The files slip.login* and slip.logout have to be executable,
but you shouldn't set a suid or sgid bit.
If you are somehow unable to compile sliplogin (e.g. no gcc installed)
then you can use the precompiled sliplogin for linux which is built without
shadow support with gcc 2.7.2 and libc 5.2.16 in ELF format.
