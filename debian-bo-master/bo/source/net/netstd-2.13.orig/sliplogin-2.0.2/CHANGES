CHANGES from 1.5 to 1.6
=======================
Sliplogin no longer forks. Please report if this causes any trouble.
These changes are made by Jon Lewis:
Changed output messages to deal with stupid windows clients.
Added 2 seconds delay.
Added a default user.

CHANGES from 1.6 to 1.6.1
=======================
Added a fflush() call after the output message to force
printing.

CHANGES from 1.6.1 to 2.0
=========================
Now sliplogin watches the incoming IP traffic if you activated the /proc
filesystem. This means you can specify a timeout while the slip client
must send something through the slip interface or sliplogin will terminate
the slip session. This feature is pretty untested since i lack the
equipment so report bugs asap, please. The side effect of this is
that slip.hosts needs the new timeout value to be set.
Another new feature is brought to you by Dick Porter. Sliplogin now
supports NIS (YP) tables. You can put slip.hosts on a NIS server
and sliplogin will search in the NIS table for the user entries instead
of /etc/slip.hosts.
Last but not least sliplogin writes the total sum of sent and received
packets in the syslog file (if possible).
Read the manual on how to use the 2 new (optional) features.
A few more options have been added in the Makefile.
Update your old slip.hosts.

CHANGES from 2.0 to 2.0.1
=========================
Though i didn't receive a bug report, i discovered that sliplogin
didn't use the NIS entry. This is hopefully fixed now.


Changes from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2
===========================
Security fixes thanks to Olaf Kirch <okir@monad.swb.de>.
