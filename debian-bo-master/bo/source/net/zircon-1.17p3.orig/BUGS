Known Problems

1.17 - 17 May 1996

If you have any hard information about any of these problems please let me know
ASAP so that I can clear them....

-  Clear does not work - this is a tk problem I think and I have not yet
   got a work-around for it. JKO tells me has this on his list of things to
   fix. It is not fixed in tk4.1 A fix for tsi seems a long way off.

-  Help system. Not much of it is there yet!

-  The history mechanism doesn't handle some recalls properly, namely
   lines containing ircII formatting characters and lines generated
   using morse/rot13/reverse.

-  People DEC Alphas running OSF/1 seem to experience some trouble with
   the X resource settings - buttons dont look 3D and checkbuttons don't
   show up as checked. I dont' have an Alpha so I cant check it out - sounds
   like a tk problem.

-  Problems with option settings for individual tags

-  If you have both a system preferences file and a personal preferences
   file there is a possibility of confusion when using the configuration
   system.

-  In certain circumstances, handling nick changes can get into a very
   difficult situation. These *ought* not to appear for the majority of
   people, but could if you have an unfortunate conjunction of friends'
   nicks, active DCC connections and a nick change..... I am working on
   a total solution to this, but it may turn out to be impossible without
   changing some other behaviour which I dont want to do if at all possible.
