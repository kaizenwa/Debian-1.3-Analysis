Notice and Message Windows
--------------------------

When a user sends a message to you a new window will pop up and you
can type to it just like a channel and the conversation will proceed.
When a notice comes in the same thing happens but your replies will be
sent back as messages. Notice windows are really only useful when
comunicating with service providers rather than users.
