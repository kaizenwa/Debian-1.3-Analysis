Zircon Information Window
-------------------------

This is where all messages that do not have another place to go to get
sent. Such things as Message of the Day and various errors routinely
appear here. You can divert other messages to this window by setting
various configuration options if you do not want to see them as pop up
windows. The entry at the bottom of the window allows you type irc II
style commands should you actually wish to do this - only a subset of
the commands are supported as several of them make no sense in the
zircon environment.
