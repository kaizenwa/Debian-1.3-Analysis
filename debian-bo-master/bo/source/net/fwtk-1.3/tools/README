	This directory contains unsupported components of the toolkit.
Mostly they are "unsupported" because they either rely on or contain
code from other sources (e.g.: BSD) which might not build easily to all
platforms. 

admin		- administrative/summarizing scripts and utilities
client		- clients for use with proxies
server		- server support tools
