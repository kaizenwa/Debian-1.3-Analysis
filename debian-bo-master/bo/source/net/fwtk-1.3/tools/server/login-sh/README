	This is a simple front-end authenticator. Rather than
hack authentication into /bin/login, this can be defined as the
user's login shell and runs *as* *them* then eventually exec()s
the correct command interpreter.

	Before running this, ensure that:

	a) rsh/rexec/rcmd is disabled on the system
	b) the chsh command is deleted or the setuid bit unset

	THIS SHOULD BE STATICALLY LINKED IF YOU ARE RUNNING IT ON A SUN.
