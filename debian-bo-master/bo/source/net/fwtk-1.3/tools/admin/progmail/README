	This is a simple little hack I use to replace the shell in
sendmail.cf, where it invokes it for program mailing. Other approaches
for doing this are to use smrsh by Allman. On a firewall, though, I don't
want *any* program mailings done.

	Install this in /usr/local/etc and edit the line
in sendmail.cf that looks like:

Mprog,	P=/bin/sh,   F=lsDFMeuP,  S=10, R=20, A=sh -c $u
	to look like:
Mprog,	P=/usr/local/etc/progmail,   F=lsDFMeuP,  S=10, R=20, A=sh -c $u
