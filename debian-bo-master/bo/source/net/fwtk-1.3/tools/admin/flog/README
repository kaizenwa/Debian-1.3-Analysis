	I often used to do a "tail -f /usr/adm/syslog" while I worked,
so I could watch log messages roll by as I debugged stuff. Unfortunately,
tail doesn't check for write errors and never exits, so if I logged out
and forgot to shut it down, the next user got syslog messages dumped to
their screen even if they didn't want them.

	Flog (follow log) does what tail does except it's smart enough
to exit. It has a compiled-in default file to follow, or will use an
environment variable "FLOG_FILE" as the file to watch. If invoked with
a filename it will monitor that file instead.
