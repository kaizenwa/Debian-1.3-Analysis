	TIS provides this software as a public service to experienced
systems administrators who wish to build Internet firewalls. While we
have made every effort to adequately document, comment, and package
this software to make it as easy to use and install as possible, we
do not recommend that it be used by persons unfamiliar with UNIX and
UNIX security.

	The firewall toolkit is intended to be useable on a wide
range of UNIX systems. In order to keep it portable, neither the
software nor the documentation delves into the specifics of different
UNIX operating systems. The toolkit is security software, and relies
heavily on features of the base operating system and the UNIX
software model. Installers who are not very familiar with the details of
their version of UNIX and its particular security problems may
not be able to install the toolkit securely. TIS assumes no responsibility
and cannot afford to support users who have questions about
the basics of their systems. In a very real sense, this software
is intended for use by security experts and experienced system
administrators only.

	Our support policy with respect to the freely available
version of this software is that we will do our best to fix bugs
in a timely manner, and we are more than happy to try to work
with you to resolve any bugs in our software. We cannot, however,
provide individual support on basic security issues or address
specific operating system bugs or incompatibilities.
