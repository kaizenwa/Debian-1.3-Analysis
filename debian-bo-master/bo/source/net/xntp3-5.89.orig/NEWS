New in 5.89
* ntpdate works under IRIX6 now
* Bugfix in ntp_proto.c
* See if gcc likes -pipe
* Cleanup NOKMEM logic in configure
* Don't use signalled I/O right now
* Serial refclocks now seem to work on the Alpha, if we avoid signalled I/O
* Distribute a needed NT subdir
* Compiles cleanly under IRIX64
* Lint cleanup
  (5.88.2)
* Use nonblocking sockets even if we HAVE_SIGNALED_IO
* HTML and Linux cleanup
* parse changes/cleanup
* xntpd now takes the -A option to disable authentication
* Mips RiscOS/4 now works (does anybody care besides me?)
* AIX4.2 can't USE_{UDP,TTY}_SIGPOLL
* Typos fixed in util/ntptime.c for Linux
* Irix6.2 will default to -n32 for CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.  Small makefile
  bugfix, too.  Broadcasts don't seem to work for irix6.  Needs GNU make
  if you want to build outside of the main source tree.
* FreeBSD patches (UDP_WILDCARD_DELIVERY now enabled)
* NT Patches
* Bugfix for HPUX systems (Use hpux-specific FindConfig())
* More bugfixes for pre-HPUX-10 systems (getting rid of SYS_HPUX)
* Bugfix for pre-HPUX-10 systems (systime.c and _clear_adjtime())

New in 5.88:
* Major cleanup and improvements to ntp_loopfilter.c
* On Vr4 (like Solaris) machines with a working clock_settime(), we do
  a much better job of synching the clock now.
* Compiles with less "noise" on more systems
* Allows KERNEL_PLL in more cases
* BSDI and refclock_true patches
* Bugfixes.
* Portability patches for SCO (syslog is a macro there)
* Portability patches for NextStep
* NT patches and documentation cleanup

New in 5.87:
* Changed some code that used 32-bit arithmetic to 64-bit arithmetic
  to cope with very broken servers.
* gcc -O2 -Wall now almost silent for Solaris2.5 and SunOS4.
* New parse clock and parse clock patches from Frank Kardel
* Irix6 now does UDP_WILDCARD_ENABLE
* Convert to autoconf-2.12
* Xntpd now runs at RTP_PRIO_REALTIME
* Solaris bugfix

New in 5.86.13:

* In xntpd, set the umask to 022 iff the incoming umask is 0.
* (5.86.12.2)

* Convert to autoconf-2.11

New in 5.86.12:
* Clean up getclock() usage (works on the DEC Alpha again).
