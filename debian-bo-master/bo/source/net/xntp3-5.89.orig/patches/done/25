Hello,

I volunteered to move the Linux implementation (odd "struct timex" in 
timex.h) towards the standard. Linus Torvalds asked me to get your 
opinion first. Well, I hope you don't reject; maybe you can send me 
the main problems YOU have with Linux to make my ToDO list...

Despite of that I read notes.html yesterday I found a few buglets. 
I'll attach the patch (this is relative to my last patch, but you can 
apply it even without that)

Ulrich Windl
