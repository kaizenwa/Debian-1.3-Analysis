H,

There is in fact a request to disable authentication via command line.
It can of course be done using a configuration file, but some folks don't
want that. I think your suggestion is great: -a turns it on (old versions,
politely ignored in new) and -A turns it off. Some folks might disable
it during configuration (the code is still there) and -a to turn it on.
