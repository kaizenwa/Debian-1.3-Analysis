Hello

Just FYI:
extracting the archive uner NT always failed because of
the directory "aux". NT has a device called "aux" so it is
impossible to generate a directory called "aux".
Only splitting the extracting in two parts helps.


If i rename ntp.conf to some thing other, xntp3-5.87.6 now hangs 
completely, after the net start commando.
Net stop can't stop
net start can't start it any more
There was the "access violation error" better. 
(I compiled the debug version this time).
