    Sure.  There are two possibilities that I know of at present:
    
        i386-unknown-osf1mk
    
    is the output that our present releases produce.  All of the
    configuration values that I provided are appropriate to this release.


    Older releases will produce:
    
        i386-unknown-osf1
    
    This would be equivalent to the configuration that was specified
    by machines/ix86osf1 in earlier NTP releases (e.g. 3.5f).

    At present, i386 is the only machine identifier that uname
    produces, and consequently the only one that will appear in the
    config.guess output, even though we may be running on a 486 or
    586.  However, i486 or i586 could appear if we ever updated our
    uname output.
    
    That should be it.  Let me know if any other questions.
    
    Tnx.
