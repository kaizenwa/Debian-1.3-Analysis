Folks,

In compiling xntp3-5.87.6 on our SunOS-4.1.3_U1B machines, while using
the vendor-supplied unbundled compiler (SC-3.0.1) "acc", I found it
necessary after "configure" was done to:

bogart 52% mv config.h config.h.bak
bogart 53% sed -e 's/#define DECL_STDIO_0 1/#undef DECL_STDIO_0/' \
		< config.h.bak > config.h

Without the above change, I got failures to compile due to redeclaration
of various STDIO functions, which are declared in SC-3.0.1's "stdio.h".
I don't think this was a problem in 3-5.85, which is the previous version
we had tried on this OS.

Happy New Year & Regards,
