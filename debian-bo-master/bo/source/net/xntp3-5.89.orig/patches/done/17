I'm compiling xntpd for AIX 3.2.5 and I've come up with 2 problems.

1.  I had to do a make CFLAGS='-g -DRS6000' because RS6000 was not defined
	and so fdmask fds rdfdes nfound and fd_set were not being set.
	sys/select.h was not being included in ntp_select.h in
	ntpdate/ntpdate.c

2.  In xntpd/ntp_io.c lines 22-23:

#ifdef HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H         /* Was most BSDs and AIX - looking for what? */
# include <sys/ioctl.h> /**/

	I had to uncomment the include...why?  it looks like is should have
	been uncommented, but it wasn't.  This caused SIOCGIFCONF
	SIOCGIFFLAGS SIOCGIFADDR SIOCGIFBRDADDR and SIOCGIFNETMASK to be
	undefined.

I can send you my config.cache or anything else if you need/want.  Let
me know.

I did this build on 5 platforms, HP-UX 9, Solaris 2.4, Sunos 4.1.4,
OSF/1 3.2, and AIX 3.2.5, and the only problems I had were with AIX...
:-)
