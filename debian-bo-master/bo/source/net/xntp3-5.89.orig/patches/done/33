H,

For BSDi, default SLEWALWAYS to on and get on with our lives. Left
off, the daemon will use settimeofday() if the offset is greater
than 128 ms and if the offset has persisted for 15 minutes. If
on, settimeofday() is never called. In such cases, best current practice
is to use ntpdate to slamdunk the time before starting xntpd. That's
why the FORCE_STEP thing in ntpdate.
