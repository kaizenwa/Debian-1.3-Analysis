README file for directory ./include of the NTP Version 3 distribution

This directory contains the include files used by most programs in this
distribution.

Note that multicast support (MCAST define) requires the header file
/usr/include/netinet/in.h for the particular architecture to be in place.
This file is constructed during the installation process in older systems;
it is already in place for those machines that support multicast ex box.
The file in.h included in this distribution is for Suns; the files for
other systems can be found in the multicast distribtutions for each
architecture separately.
