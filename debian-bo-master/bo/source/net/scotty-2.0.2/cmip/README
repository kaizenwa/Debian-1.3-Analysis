This directory contains a tcl wrapper for the OSIMIS CMIP implementation.
It is based on OSIMIS version 3.0p1 which is the last public version.

The code is mostly derived from the mcreate, mdelete, ... sources of
the OSIMIS package. There are some known bugs in the CMIP code of
OSIMIS 3.0p1. Please contact <osimis-licence-request@uk.ac.ucl.cs> for
license conditions for OSIMIS 4.0. We did not port this tcl interface
to 4.0 but would welcome any patches for it. Perhaps you can even
convince the OSIMIS people to make at least the cmip protocol stack
publically available ;-).

A sample OIM-SMA browser for the tkined editor is in the
../tkined/cmip_trouble.tcl script.

A short description of the cmip tcl command is in the
../doc/cmiptcl.man man page.
