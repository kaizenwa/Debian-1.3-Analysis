This file contains auto-loadable library code written for the scotty
Tcl extension. The idea is to write monitoring jobs that can be
embedded into management applications or even mid-level manager (or
smart agents - whatever is right name today).

Here is a short list of the contents of these files:

dialog.tcl	-- Some dialogs that I use frequently.

output.tcl	-- An output window that I use frequently to display
		   arbitrary text.

snmp.tcl	-- Some utilities to pretty print SNMP information.
		   These utilities call the proc writeln to write the
		   text to whatever you want. If you alias writeln
		   with puts, you get all to stdout. The output window
		   (see above) defines writeln to write to the text
		   widget.

ifload.tcl	-- Calculate the interface load based on data available
		   from RFC1213 standard mibs. Note, some agents have this
		   feature build into the enterprise agent extension.
