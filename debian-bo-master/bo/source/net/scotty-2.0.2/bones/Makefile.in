# This is a Makefile for the bones directory of scotty. If it has the 
# name "Makefile.in" then it is a template for a Makefile; to generate 
# the actual Makefile, run "./configure", which is a configuration 
# script generated by the "autoconf" program (constructs like "@foo@" 
# will get replaced in the actual Makefile.

#----------------------------------------------------------------
# Things you can change to personalize the Makefile for your own
# site (you can make these changes in either Makefile.in or
# Makefile, but changes to Makefile will get lost if you re-run
# the configuration script).
#----------------------------------------------------------------

# Default top-level directories in which to install architecture-
# specific files (exec_prefix) and machine-independent files such
# as scripts (prefix).  The values specified here may be overridden
# at configure-time with the --exec-prefix and --prefix options
# to the "configure" script.

# Directory in which to install the program scotty:
BIN_DIR =	$(exec_prefix)/bin

# Directory in which to install the archive libscotty.a:
LIB_DIR =       $(exec_prefix)/lib

# To change the compiler switches, for example to change from -O
# to -g, change the following line:
CFLAGS = -O

# A "-I" switch that can be used when compiling to make all of the
# X11 include files accessible (the configure script will try to
# set this value, and will cause it to be an empty string if the
# include files are accessible via /usr/include).
X11_INCLUDES =  @XINCLUDES@

# A "-I" switch that can be used when compiling to make all the
# Tcl include files accessible (the configure script will try to
# set this value).
TCL_INCLUDES =	@TCL_INC@

# A "-I" switch that can be used when compiling to make the msql 
# include files accessible (the configure script will try to
# set this value).
MSQL_INCLUDES =	@MSQL_INC@

# To disable ANSI-C procedure prototypes reverse the comment 
# characters on the following lines:
PROTO_FLAGS =
#PROTO_FLAGS = -DNO_PROTOTYPE

# Some versions of make, like SGI's, use the following variable to
# determine which shell to use for executing commands:
SHELL =		/bin/sh

# Makefile is generated from Makefile.in.  You shouldn't normally
