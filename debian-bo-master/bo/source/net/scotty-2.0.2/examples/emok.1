.I email-addresses
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B emok
tests if an email address is valid. It first resolves any MX records
before it connects to SMTP daemons to verify an email address. The
whole process is done recursively.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-d"
Print debugging output. The format is ugly but it helps to understand
what emok is doing and why.
.TP
.BI "-m " max_level
Set the maximum length of a email address chain to
.I maxlevel.
The default is 12.
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH BUGS
Since UUCP connections can not be traced directly, there may be
answers like `user unknown' although the email address is a good one.
Ideas how to handle this case are very welcome.

Checking addresses of mailing lists is time consuming and very expensive.
Use with care.
