snmpwalk \- walk a snmp MIB tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpwalk 
.I host
.I label
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpwalk
retrieves a MIB subtree from a SNMP agent and shows the
instance names with their values. The agent is given by the
\fIhost\fR argument. Note, \fIhost\fR should be a known SNMP alias
defined in the users ~/.scottyrc or in the system wide /usr/local/lib/scotty/site/init.tcl file. If no alias definition exists, a SNMPv1 session
on port 161 and community public is used. The \fIlabel\fR
argument defines the top node of the MIB used to start the walk.
All variables in the subtree below the given node are queried
and their values presented to the user.
.SH ALIAS DEFINITIONS
SNMP aliases are used to handle SNMP parameters needed to talk to SNMP
agents. Please read the scotty(1) man page for details.
