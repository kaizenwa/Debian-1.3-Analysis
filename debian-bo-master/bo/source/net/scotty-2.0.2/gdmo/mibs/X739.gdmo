-- Annex A

-- Metric objects

-- (This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.)

-- NOTE  -  The  definition  of  metric  object  classes  does  not  prevent  managed  object  definers  from  including  management information defined in clause 8 within the definition of other managed object classes. When defining new managed object classes with metric attributes, the definers should consider the utilization of the metric object classes defined in this annex.
