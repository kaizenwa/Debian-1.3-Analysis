Version .91:  Changed the ASN type for the types: Counter, Ipaddress, gauge,
timeticks, and opaque.  The SMI defines them as application specific types,
not ASN_INTEGER and ASN_OCTET_STRING.
Version 1.0 Added snmpnetstat, snmptrap, snmptrapd.  Everything runs on a new
API that has an asynchronous interface.  Most old hard-coded limits are either
non-existent or much larger than necessary.  The mib module now gets it's data
by parsing a text file in the same ASN.1 format as is given in RFC1066.
