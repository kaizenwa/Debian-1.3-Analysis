.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dhcpcd
is an implementation of the DHCP client specified in
.B draft-ietf-dhc-dhcp-09
(when -r option is not specified) and
.B RFC1541
(when -r option is specified).

It gets the host information (IP address, netmask, broadcast address,
etc.) from a DHCP server and configures the network interface of the
machine on which it is running. It also tries to renew the lease time
according to
.B RFC1541
or
.B draft-ietf-dhc-dhcp-09.



.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c \ filename
Specifies the command file which is invoked when
.B dhcpcd
successfully gets an IP address.
.TP
.BI \-d
Forces
.B dhcpcd
to run in the foreground.
.TP
.BI \-i \ classIdentifier
Specifies the class identifier string.
.B dhcpcd
uses the default class identifier string (system name, sytem release,
and machine type) if it is not specified.
.TP
.BI \-k
Sends a
.B SIGTERM
signal to the
.B dhcpcd
process that is currently running.
.TP
.BI \-l \ leasetime
Specifies (in seconds) the recommended lease time to the server. (Note
that the server can override this value if it sees fit). This value is
used in the DHCPDISCOVER message.
.TP
.BI \-r
Makes dhcpcd RFC1541 compliant. dhcpcd is draft-ietf-dhc-dhcp-09
compliant unless this option is specified.
.TP
.BI interface
Specifies the network interface name (eth0, eth1, etc.).
.B dhcpcd
uses the network interface
.I eth0
unless an explicit name is specified.

.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 25
.B /etc/dhcpc
directory used for storing files
created by
.B dhcpcd
.TP 25
.BI /etc/dhcpc/hostinfo\- interface
file in which
.B dhcpcd
saves the host information. The word
.I interface
is actually replaced with the network interface name like
.I eth0
to which dhcpcd is attached.
.TP 25
.B /etc/dhcp/resolv.conf
file created by
.B dhcpcd
when the client receives DNS and domain name options
.TP 25
.B /var/run/dhcpcd\-pid
file containing the process id of
.B dhcpcd
.TP 25
.BI /var/run/dhcpcd\-cache. interface
cache file containing the previously assigned IP address. The word
.I interface
is actually replaced with the network interface name like
.I eth0
to which
.B dhcpcd
is attached.

.SH SEE ALSO
.I Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,
RFC1541 and draft-ietf-dhc-dhcp-09.
.LP
.I DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions,
RFC1533

.SH BUGS
.B dhcpcd
uses
.B time(3)
to calculate the lease expiration time.  If the system time is changed
while the client is running, the lease expiration time may not be
predictable.

.B dhcpcd
does not support the DHCPINFORM message.

.B dhcpcd
cannot handle DHCP options (e.g. domain name) which have more than 255
characters. All the DHCP options have to be less than or equal to 255.
