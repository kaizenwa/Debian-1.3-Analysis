1.4                     Changed to get rid of the SEGV in the case where
                        the program is executed with NO arguments.
                        Added a check to see if the 'dip' program is
                        available where assumed and that it's excutable. If
                        it's not, the line won't hang-up. Now sliphangup
                        makes an explicit warning and tries to locate
                        dip from the PATH.  If it can't find it then it
                        tries to kill it right away from its PID.

1.3	95.10.16	Added code to check for version as format of route
			table in proc filesystem changed in version 1.3.34.
			Added code to hangup the connection if we're unable
			to detect the line usage.  Safer that way!

1.2	95.08.10	Log disconnect times to syslog.  Correct argument
			count bug.

1.1	94.09.25	Force program to terminate when an error is
			detected on the interface polling at any time.

1.0	94.09.10	First version of sliphangup.
