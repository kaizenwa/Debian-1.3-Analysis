	* Started to keep a ChangeLog :-)
	* Added support for -f option when using shadow passwords.
	  (The crucial hint on spw_name() courtesy of Torsten Duwe)
	* Added a bunch of diffs by Dan Stromberg to support password
	  checking with obvious(), and some portability fixes. I changed
	  a couple of them because they broke Linux, so it's quite
	  possible I broke Dan's work while doing so.
