I have put the old dbm utilitys and ypMakefile in this directory,
because with them it gave some problems:

 * There is a bug in the scanner routine, so we could not create
   the netgroup map with them.

 * They do not support the YP_* keys, which are needed for 
   master/slave support and the correct use of rpc.yppasswdd.

 * People try to make from a single ypserv system a master/
   slave system without rebuilding the maps.

You could compile them with:

  gcc -I.. -o dbcat dbcat.c -lgdbm


getpwnam.c: Shows the data, it get back from the getpwnam function call.
            For debugging purpose and testing.
