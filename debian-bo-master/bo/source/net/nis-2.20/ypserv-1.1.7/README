This is version 1.1.7 of an YP (NIS version 2) Server for Linux, but it
also runs under other OS like SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.x, AIX, HP-UX,
IRIS, Ultrix and OSF1 (alpha).

This is NOT an NIS+ (NIS version 3) Server !

See the file COPYING for copying restrictions. It is available under
the GNU General Public License.

The server can optionally do DNS lookups for hosts not found in the
regular YP hosts map. But beware that for this to work then you
*must* link the YP server to a library where the gethostbyname()
and gethostbyaddr() routines always talk to a DNS server. The default
routines in the normal libc libraries often try to check the
YP servers first -> causing a nice loop...
For Linux, the functions in dns_hosts.c will do that correct, so
you could enable this feature. But this functions will not compile
under other OS then Linux. Under SunOS and Solaris you could use
the resolv+ library, I don't know if they work on other Systems.
DNS lookup is enabled by using the "-dns" flag.

There are two ways to check if the client is allowed to ask the
ypserv daemon: "securenets" and "tcp wrapper". See the file
"README.secure" for more information.

This server has been compiled on Linux (2.0/2.1), SunOS 4.1.3C and
SunOS 5.5. I know there are problems with Linux libc 5.0.9. You should
at least use libc 5.2.18 or greater. I haven't tested it with
libc 5.4.21 and the new YP stuff. But since it is the same as in
GNU libc 2.0, it should work, too.

Thanks to Terje Malmedal <terje.malmedal@usit.uio.no>, who had send
patches for AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, Ultrix and OSF1(alpha).
