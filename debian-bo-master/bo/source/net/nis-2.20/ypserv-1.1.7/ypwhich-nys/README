This ypwhich is from the yp-clients 2.2 package from Swen Thuemmler.
It is copyright by Theo de Raadt. Look at ypwhich.c for more information.

This version of ypwhich will not seg. fault, when there is no 
running ypbind. You should install it, if you are using a libc with NYS
support.  Or if you will install a slave NIS server on your host, and
you have put the localhost as ypserver in /etc/yp.conf.
