Things to do (in no particular order):

        o Some people have problems with a SGI as NIS Master or
          NIS Slave server, I need better bug reports since I 
          couldn't test it.

	o Implement the :include: directive from /etc/aliases

	o Make sure there are no memory leaks

	o Remove all remaining bugs :-)
