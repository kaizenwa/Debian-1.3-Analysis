.SH NAME
strobe \- Super optimised TCP port prober
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B strobe
[ -vVbetnSilfs ] [host1 ... [hostn]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I strobe
locates and describes all listening tcp ports on a (remote) host or on
many hosts in a bandwidth utilisation maximising, and process resource 
minimising manner.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose output.
.TP
.B \-V
Verbose statistical output.
.TP
.B \-s
Statistical information describing the average of all hosts probed is sent to
stderr on completion.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode. Don't print non-fatal errors or the (c) message.
.TP
.B \-d
Display only the first description in the port services entry file (Cf.
.BR \-B ).
.TP
.B \-o file
Direct output (but not any messages which can be affected by
.BR \-q )
to file.
.TP
.B \-b number
Beginning (starting) port number.
.TP
.B \-e
Ending port number.
.TP
.B \-t number
Time after which a connection attempt to a completely unresponsive host/port is
aborted.
.TP
.B \-n number
Use this number of sockets in paralell (defaults to 64). 
.I strobe
attempts to figure out if
.B number
is greater than the quantity of available sockets at any point in time -- and
if so, only use the amount found. On some UNIX implimentations such as Solaris,
this appears not to work correctly and you may find yourself with unusual errors
such as
.B NO ROUTE TO HOST
when you hit the socket ceiling. Remember that 
.I strobe
probably isn't the only process on the system desiring a socket or two. Having
.I strobe
pilfer all the spare sockets away from 
.BR inetd (8)
and other daemons and clients isn't such a crash hot idea, unless you want
to stop all new incoming and outgoing connections.
.TP
.B \-S file
Change the default port services description file to
.BR file .
Note that if 
.B \-S
is not specified port services are loaded from one of
.BR strobe.services ,
.BR /usr/local/lib/strobe.services ,
or
.BR /etc/services .
.TP
.B \-i file
Obtain hostnames to strobe from 
.B file
rather than from the command line. Note that only the first white-space
seperated word in each line of
.B file
is used, so one can feed in files such as
.BR /etc/hosts .
.TP
.B \-l
Probe hosts linearly (sequentually) rather than in paralell. The actuall
ports on each host are still checked in a paralell manner (with a paralellism
of -n (defaults to 64)).
.TP
.B \-f
Fast mode, probe only the tcp ports detailed in the port services file (see
.BR \-S ).
.TP
.B \-a number
Abort and skip to the next host after ports to
.B number
have been probed and still no connections have occurred.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
strobe -n 120 -a 80 -i /etc/hosts -s -f -V -S services -o out
.PP
.I strobe
all entries in
.B /etc/hosts
(identical ip addresses are skipped automagically)
using 120 sockets in paralell, but only check the individual tcp ports mentioned
in
.BR services .
If we have probed up to port 80 on a host
and have still not yet evidenced a connection, then skip that host. Display speed/time
statistics for each host and for the totality of hosts to stderr. Place the regular
output in
.BR out .
