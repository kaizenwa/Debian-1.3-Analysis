Ver 2.1 : Scot E. Wilcoxon, Minnesota, USA (sewilco@fieldday.mn.org) 96/01/02
          - Report last error number and number of errors from recvfrom().
          - Reorganized display to be more compact (making room for creeping
            features).
          - Dynamically show IP protocols and known TCP and UDP ports.
          - Dynamically show Ethernet protocols.
          - Added loopback interface statistics. 
          - Only show the active interfaces.
          - Added a hint of what keys to press when 'h' or unknown key entered.
          - Added SN_LIST_SWAP as a list swap thrashing limit, to reduce redraw.
          - Regularly check for read errors and dropped packets on eth0.
          - Changed subwindow allocation logic, and only reallocate upon redraw.
          - Tall skinny or short wide screens supported.

Ver 2.0 : Scot E. Wilcoxon, Minnesota, USA (sewilco@fieldday.mn.org) 95/11/30
          - Fixed a memory leak in curses screens.
	  - Replaced constant byte values into frame buffer with references
            to system-defined values where known.
	  - Replaced calculation of protocol number with the ntos() standard.
	  - Speed up screen update by only writing labels once.
	  - Release initialization memory after initialization.
	  - Added test for Appletalk protocol number.
          - Added Appletalk command line option.
	  - Added TCP/IP port statistics.
          - Added PPP and SLIP to PLIP statistics.
          - Added dynamic alteration of screen (type options while running).
          - Changed Kb/sec (kilobits) to KB/sec (kilobytes).
          - Reduced size of packet buffer (kernel discards the excess).
          - Added some IEEE 802.2 packet recognition.
          - Added labels for "Other" packet types and "Other" 802.2 SAPs.
          - Added symbol in stat.h to specify number of seconds between updates.
          - Added display of number of frames to Types screen (the number
            of total frames during the sampled interval, not frames/sec).
          - Option in itstime.c to show ICMP packets (might show flood pings).
          - Add Vines protocol packets to Vines_under_IP total.

Ver 1.00: Jeroen Baekelandt (jeroenb@igwe.vub.ac.be) 95/01/06
          - fixed a floating point exception
          - added a new column in the types window, displaying
            percentuale use of each frame type.
          - added some command line options to choose which windows
            to display. Less windows results in less calculation.
          - edited config file so that another ethernet device can
            be specified

Ver 0.99: Jeroen Baekelandt (jeroenb@igwe.vub.ac.be)
          - first public version.. more or less stable
