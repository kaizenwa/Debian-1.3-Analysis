Statnet ver 2.1

Statnet views the statistics of your Ethernet and PLIP/PPP/SLIP for TCP, IP,
IPX, Appletalk, and whatever else it notices.

It views:
	- kilobytes per second on ethernet, plip, and other interfaces.
	- the load of ethernet
	- frames per second.
	- how many frames of each type (like IP, ARP .. and some Appletalk
	  or TCP frames) were seen.

The purpose is to give some idea of the quantity and type of network
activity (flashing lights on the hub are minimally informative).  Other
tools are needed for detailed analysis.

Only certain packets were shown in earlier versions.  Now the data for the
packets encountered on your net are shown.  Only certain TCP/UDP ports are
known (under port 1024 by default), and TCP/UDP traffic to unknown port numbers
is not shown, although the presence of the frames are shown in protocol counts.

Probably a configuration file should be used, and that mess in services.c
should be read from /etc/services and rfc1700.txt or a data file.

This tool is used to help an administrator see how the network is being used.
Users often don't need this much detail, although many students are
administrators-in-training.  Administrator's network monitors might detect
this tool, so approval by an administrator before using this tool is courteous
and prudent.

The "make install" creates an executable which anyone on your system can use.
Might not be a good thing to do if you have users in your machine who
shouldn't be able to see what's flowing through your network.

Some receive errors may happen, depending upon your interface card and
hardware/software configuration.  See `netstat -i` or `ifconfig` while statnet
is not running to find if errors occur while the NIC is not in promiscuous mode.
The 3C509 is known to have problems (http://www.3com.com/ Etherlink III FAQ).

And I see this short README has grown as much as the rest.  That's it...
