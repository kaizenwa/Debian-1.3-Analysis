Statnet ver 2.1

COMPILATION:

  - Edit the makefile to meet your needs (nothing much to edit though)
  - Edit the '#define ETH "eth0"' line in stat.h if you don't want
    eth0 to be the ethernet device that statnet listens to.
  - Type "make"

INSTALLATION:

  - Copy it to the place you want to have it :)

RUNNING:

  - You need root privileges because the program has to set your
    ethernet card in promiscuous mode (don't worry, if you quit with "q", 
    it changes back to normal)

  - synopsis: statnet [-agipstuh]

  - options: a  show Appletalk window
             g  show General window
             i  show IP Protocols window

             no options shows most windows

  - options may be typed while running.
  - the other runtime option is "q" to quit

  - just run it, you'll see
