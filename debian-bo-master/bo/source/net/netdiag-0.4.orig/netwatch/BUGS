	Appears to be a linked list display problem (which self-corrects
	in time (15 sec)) where hosts are duplicated and some holes in the
	list appear. This does correct itself due to a forced update
	every 15 sec. 

	WARNING... Has not been tested on B/W display...(probably won't
		function quite right yet)

	<TAB> switching while in HELP or WATCH mode will work BUT
	needs time for display to correct (initial problem).
