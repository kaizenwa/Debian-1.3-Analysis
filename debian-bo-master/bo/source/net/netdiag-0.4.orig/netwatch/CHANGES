3.0	Added Watch Facility - to display router stats including
	maximum burst rates (on a second interval in BITS/SEC)
	Ability to Clear Burst info ('c' key)

For 0.4 Release...

1.0	Revamped the "processrcinet.c" routine to PARSE the
	"ifconfig" line and be smarter about GLOBAL variables in
	use as opposed to hard coded addresses.

	NOTE: As global variables, it still assumes IPADDR and
	     NETMASK as the names of info that it picks up.

2.0	New Statistics
	- router throughput (updated per minute -- roughly )
	- new option for actual BYTE counts received and transmitted
