#this is an example "ignorefiles" file.
#files matching a regular expression patterns listed here will not
#get a symlink from /tftpboot/$IP/$file to /$file

#BTW, please remove the '/etc' prefix when entering the filenames.

#If you want your nfsroot cliens to have different files, than the
#server, drop them in /etc/nfsroot/default/$file, or to specify
#a specific client, /etc/nfsroot/$IP/$file. (see, as an example
#/etc/nfsroot/default/etc/X11/{Xserver,XF86Config})


#Do make sure the clients aren't going to mess up the (with bootpd
#correctly) configured network, by executing the server's /etc/init.d/network
#If you want to specify one gateway, you can do so in /etc/bootpdtab;
#if you want to do more, drop it in /etc/nfsroot/default/etc/init.d/network
#

rc4.d/network

#things may get complicated if the clients start becomming bootpd servers:
init.d/bootpd
rc4.d/nrprobenet

#I don't want my nfsroot clients to run cron (creates big logfiles, ..)
rc4.d/cron

#Furthermore, the following daemons only eat up system resources.
rc4.d/.*(httpd|bind|acct|amd|diald|quota|snmpd|xntp|netstd_nfs|netstd_misc|nrprobenet)

smb.conf

#the boot script will try to write to this:
motd
