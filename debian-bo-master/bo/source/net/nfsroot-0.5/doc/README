Debian nfsroot package.

30min after you installed this package on your server, you can:

Insert a nfsrootbootfloppy (create one with "mknfsrootboot")
in any computer on your local network that has it's networkcard
configured (using whatever OS), press "RESET", and, hey presto, 
it's running LINUX! 
(and is configured to do just as much as your server).

This package provides:
- A reasonably configurable script that will create /tftpboot/$ip
  directories (mostly filled with symlinks to the server's /etc,
  or /etc/nfsroot/default, or /etc/nfsroot/$IP).
  Also, a script to update these directories after you installed
  a new package (that added a file/dir to /etc).
- A standard kernel (2.0.21) configured for most ethernet cards,
  and a one-line shell script mkfsrootboot that will copy it to
  a floppy. But making your own kernel is of cource much more fun.
- A daemon that will try to obtain hardware adresses for the machines
  using a specified IP-range (I'm using 132.229.1.*)
  Each time this daemon finds a new hardware adress+corresponding
  IP number, it adds it to /etc/bootpd, sends SIGHUP to the bootpd
  process, and creates the client's nfsroot dir in /tftpboot/$IP.
  After that the client can boot into nfsroot-linux.

Security:

Although the /tftpboot/$ip directories need to be nfs-exported rw,
all configuration files should end up in the server's (ro exported)
/etc, so that they should be safe (and this package provides scripts
to recreate any /tftpboot/$ip after this directory has been messed up).


Main objectives:
  *ro mounting of as much as possible on the server, for security
  *using small amount of diskspace per possible client
  *making the clients by default all the same as the server,
   but possible different defaults for all clients, or different
   values for specific clients.
  *make it possible to nfsboot clients just by installing this package.
