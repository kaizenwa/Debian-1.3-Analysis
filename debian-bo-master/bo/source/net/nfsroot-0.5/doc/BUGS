The files etc/{fstab,inittab,init.d/boot} are still handled
very clumsily, and I should create a dir /etc/nfsroot/essential
that holds them (and symlinks to /bin/{bash,sh,mount,rm}, ..lib,...

Although all subdirectories in /etc/nfsroot/{default,$hostip} are
copyied to /tftpboot/$hostip, only the files in
/etc/nfsroot{default,$hostip}/etc get symlinks to them in /tftpboot/$hostip.

I'm reasonably happy with they way I handle the client's /etc -- but
the client's /var could do with some extra thinking.

It seems that unfsd-2.2beta16 (and beta21) sometimes gets confused when
two clients are booting simultaneously. In such cases, one of them (sometimes
both) gets bus errors (signal 7) in random processes. I've now got
patches to prevent this from the upstream maintainer, and they
are in beta23 (23 works for me).

How do I make start-stop-daemon create a pidfile? (--pidfile didn't
work, when I tried it.) So, as long as there isn't a pidfile
/var/run/bootpd.pid with the pid of bootpd in it, nrprobenet
will (constantly) complain about not being able to read it.

The first round, nrprobenet _says_ (with -v) that it's ping-ing
the host on the network, but something goes wrong and it doesn't.
It does get it right the second an other rounds, though.

nrpobenet also uses entries for hosts outside the range of ip
adresses
