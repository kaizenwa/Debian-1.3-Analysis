<BlackJac> pana: you can put multiple servers in IRCSERVER, so why not
IRCNICK

(Jordy) you need an isban() too :p
(Jordy:#warez) it removes bans like: rban *!*@*d will glob, or rban user
will remove that users ban :p
(Jordy) rban -a will remove all bans

Anitrate offers todo yet another ansi for bitchx

do
alarm 1
connect to server
alarm 0
if connect break
next server


/traceroute
/cdcc close #N

(Sheik) $getnicklist(channel user.pubflood) or something

Jordy) isop() isaway() isuser() isonline() ischannel() isshit() isbored()
(Jordy) and they shouldnt' return anything but 1 or 0, not numbers :p
(Jordy) because i want to do something like: if($isuser(blaho 50)) { ... }
        meaning, if blaho [current user is here] has at least a 50 on the
user
        list, return 1 else return 0

[dszd0g] Is there a way to: /adduser
         panasync!panasync!edwards@*.sk.sympatico.ca #BitchX,#Scriptz 90,60
         1,0 1,0 ?

<zircon> panasync: can u fix ^Q? its SUPPOSED to be quote character (like ^N
          is for us...) but its never worked in any stock client

eval for (@sl = 0, servername($sl), @sl++) {eval menuitem serverlist
          \"[$[-2]sl]  $servername($sl):$serverport($sl)\" server
          $servername($sl) $serverport($sl)}
<mikh>        for (@ cnt = 0, blah = dccitem($cnt), @ cnt++) {
<mikh>             echo <$cnt> $blah
<mikh>             comment Or you can use $word() to access different fields
          from
<mikh>             comment blah and display it in your own way, or check for
          speed etc
<mikh>        }

[wyvern] say i do   /ban <nick>   and it bans them... as soon as the mode
         sets, it can check the users on the channel to see if any match the
         ban set and kick them.. or something =P

[Dakota(~kota@aurora.pdxnet.com)] Oh yeah, also, for /whereis, you should
make a /set variable so that like 0 = it would ping them, 1 = it would
version them, 2, = it would do an ECHO Here I am! or something
like that.. hehe:)

<BlackJac> Oh yeah, that was something I thought of...
          Can you have a way to clear the mem, like dump channel stats etc?

<mathe> panasync:  you should add an auto ignore as a shitlist option..

<kwak:#tmp2> umm.. about the cdcc.. how about adding a notice line that says
          "/ctcp mynick CDCC RESEND #<num> :to resend, Allready sending you
          pack #packnum"  to someone re requesting the same pack with only
          cdcc send #<num> ..?

<Sheik> make a  fd_set list that will call a callback function.
<Sheik> so we can make  /finger /nslookup   etc work without blocking.

[wyvern(cardinal@deepthought.armory.com)] hmm.. u should make a $chanops()
          that's like $chanusers() but it only returns channel ops =)

<kae>  char *new_new_malloc(char *str)
<kae>  {
<kae>   int len = strlen(str);
<kae>   char *ret = stack_top;
<kae>   if (str != stack_top)
<kae>           memcpy(stack_top, str, len+1);
<kae>   stack_top += len+1;
<kae>   return ret;
<kae>  }

[Raistlin(raistlin@dialup17.toledolink.com)] NoNo...  DOH.. Make BitchX.. :D
          Grumble..  The reason is with more ppl adding ANSI to there bots..
          you need a way to distinguish between ANSI and Non ANSI clients..
          the standard in ANSI is esc[6n replied with esc[XX;YYR  which could
          be used to check.

[myc-(myc@irc.nwlink.com)] a trace command.  With flaggs and such.  So you
can
          like type /trace -o <servername> and it will show you the opers on
          that server that are currently on.

<psykotyk> like, ^on ^window_birth * {window split on;window double on}

[BlackJac(~dbk7@WALNUT.CADIF.CORNELL.EDU)] FORMAT_SERVER_KILLS should be
          something like: "BlackJac killed panasync
          (edwards@firefly6.sk.sympatico.ca) on irc.cs.cmu.edu (You're a
          pantystink)"
[BlackJac(~dbk7@WALNUT.CADIF.CORNELL.EDU)] FORMAT_SERVER_CLIENTS for server
          notices about connecting/exiting clients.

[mathe(mathe@mathe.ppp.cyberenet.net)] hmm.. ok.. I'll mess with it again.. 
I
          had another idea.. if someone has level 25 (level for invite) - if
          they do /ctcp nick key (or whatever) #channel - it will tell them
          what the channel key is, or you can make it part of invite or
          something..

[mathe(mathe@mathe.ppp.cyberenet.net)] my brother thought of a way that
would
          hide the use of link looking a little bit.. was wondering what you
          thought of it.. instead of constantly doing a /links you could do
a
          /lusers to see if the # of servers changed, and if it did, then do
a
          links.. I ran it past sheik and he said he was a good idea, the
only
          prob. he saw with it, is that he said if the certain servers are
in
          high usage mode (or something like that) it won't allow you to do
a
          /luser,

2. BlackJac: /reld for DCCs

[myc(myc@irc.nwlink.com)] you need to code that /trace command like I told
	ya :) where you can /trace -o irc.panasync.com and it will give you a
        list of opers on the server that are opered :)

[mathe(mathe@mathe.ppp.cyberenet.net)] also, if someone has a number as nick
          you can't /relm them.. you should have something like this: /relm
	-l # nick/channel

<Sheik> say("%s: Couldn't connect to anything... Waiting 15 seconds to try a
<Sheik> AddCTimer(NULL, NULL, NULL, server, timed_nextserver, 15);
<Sheik> reconnect_flag = 1;
<Sheik> times++;

<Sheik> pana: scripers need to be able to address any window to set stuff =)
<Sheik> maybe have a  -* to do all windows
<Sheik> that would be cool

[scribe(~scribe@ppp147.rtp.intrex.net)] i got an idea for bitchx.. its kinda
          far fetched, but you know how BBS's have like menu.ans with ansi's
          with Codes built in.. well if bitchx could support codes.. you could
          make things like whois.ans,dcc.ans and stuff like that much easier
[scribe(~scribe@ppp147.rtp.intrex.net)] and more flexible..

[Apatrix(shadow@prometheus.hol.gr)] How about a new variable that will make
          you cycle when you detect yourself as beng the only user in an
          opless channel?

<psykotyk> /relm =# gives the past # messages
<psykotyk> /relm -# gives the message # messages ago
<psykotyk> /relm * +wm relays to channel wallops
<psykotyk> /relm * +wo relays to IRC wallops
<psykotyk> /relm * +t relays to topic
<psykotyk> /relm * +k nick relays to a kick

2. suicide (Jan 25 15:38): hey, can you add a function that
          will be like $odd(num) will return a 1 if the number is odd and a 0
          if it's even?  and.. is there a math function to get a remainder in
          division? thanks

[CoW(gmo@fsn-ppp90.lightspeed.net)] add like a /cdreset or something,
because  when I change cd's, I have to do like /set cd_device /dev/cdrom again...
[CoW(gmo@fsn-ppp90.lightspeed.net)] or mabey an auto reset?

sh00p well it may be sorta dumb.. but there are
all these /set things, right? what if their could be a way to have a
          few default setups for bitchx? everyone on IRC has different IRC
          skill levels.. have a paranoid setting that has lots of flood
          protection etcetera, maybe a newbie user, with just basic things
          enabled.. i dunno something along those lines maybe? or is it a bad
          idea? [05:24pm]
