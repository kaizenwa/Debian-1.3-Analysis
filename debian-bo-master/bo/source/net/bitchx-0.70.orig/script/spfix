/*
 * $spfix(text)
 *
 * This function returns text with the first word stripped off. We can't
 * use the $restw() builtin, because it will dump any extra spaces it sees
 * up to the first word (because the space is the word delimiter).
 * Basically what we do here is return all characters after the first word
 * (minus one space, since there is a one-space pad between all words that
 * any sane scripter will insert anyway). 
 *
 * You _must_ include the word before immediately preceding the spaces you
 * wish to keep. E.g., if you are hooking send_msg (which returns $0 as
 * recipient and $1- as the message), you must send $0- to the function,
 * not just $1-.
