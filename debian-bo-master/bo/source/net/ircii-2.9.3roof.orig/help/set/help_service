Usage: SET HELP_SERVICE <Name of ircII HELP service>
  When the HELP command is issued it first searches the
  current HELP_PATH for help files.  If they are not found it
  sends a message to the service specificed in HELP_SERVICE
  An example setting is.
    SET HELP_SERVICE help_US
  which would make the client query the United States ircII help 
  service.  Keep in mind that having local help files is always
  faster and generally guarantees better service.
