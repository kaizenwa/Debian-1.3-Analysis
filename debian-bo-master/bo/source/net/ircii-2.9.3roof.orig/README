please read the NEWS file to find out what is new in this
version of ircii, and the INSTALL file to find out how to
compile and install this version of ircii.

this is a proper release of ircii.  it has bugs (ircii always
has bugs).  feel free to send me context diffs to fix them,
or at least a sequence of actions to show the bug.  run the
`ircbug' script to submit bug reports.

the INSTALL file also has some additional notes on portability
issues.
