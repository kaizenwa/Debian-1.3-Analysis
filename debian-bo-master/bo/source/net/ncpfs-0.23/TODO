Here's a list of things I want to do. Feel free to send suggestions,
or even help me ;-).

- little utilities for bindery access, such as nwlsobj, nwlsprop,
  nwcreateobj and so on. 

- Add flags to pserver's command line, so that the print command can
  find out the name of user who printed the job.

- do rtt estimation, like tcp does.

- Do better connection management. I imagine to create a ncpd.

- When ncp is done, one can think about mounting several volumes over
  a single NCP connection. This should make the trade-off mentioned in
  ncpmount.8 unnecessary.

- long file names

- Do some kind of mapping of NCP uid's to unix uid's
