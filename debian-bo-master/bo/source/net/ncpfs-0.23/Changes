I only began this file with ncpfs-0.12. If you're interested in older
versions, you can find them on ftp.gwdg.de:/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs/old.

ncpfs-0.22 -> ncpfs-0.23
- Fixed a memory allocation problem in nwmsg.c. Thanks to 
  Andrew Ross <anr1001@hermes.cam.ac.uk>
- slist hopefully does not ask for a password anymore.
- cleaned up error messages a bit.
- ncpmount now calls modprobe instead of insmod.

ncpfs-0.21 -> ncpfs-0.22
- removed a bad race condition in kernel-1.2/src/dir.c.
- handle 0x9999-responses from the ncp server correctly.
- Bindery functions in ncplib.c by Brian G. Reid (breid@tim.com)
- set blocksize to 512 to satisfy 'du -k'

ncpfs-0.20 -> ncpfs-0.21
- Included two bugfixes in ncplib.c found by Jeff Buhrt
  <buhrt@iquest.net>.
- Included a bugfix in kernel code that could only show for servers
  that do not support namespace calls. I should have tried ncpfs
  against lwared... Thanks to Neil Turton <ndt1001@chu.cam.ac.uk> for
  this fix.

ncpfs-0.19 -> ncpfs-0.20
- Changed the home site for ncpfs from linux01.gwdg.de:/pub/ncpfs
  to ftp.gwdg.de:/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs. linux01 will remain available,
  but we would like to reduce the load on that machine. Sites
  mirroring linux01 please redirect your mirror software to
  ftp.gwdg.de. Thanks.
- Removed a bug in ncplib.c that made slist require a full
  login. Thanks to Neil Turton <ndt1001@chu.cam.ac.uk> for the hint.
- The first real user contribution: ncopy by Brian G. Reid
  (breid@tim.com) and Tom C. Henderson (thenderson@tim.com). Many
  thanks to you! If you find bugs in ncopy, tell them, not me ;-)
- Handle expired passwords. Thanks to "Mathew Lim" <M.Lim@sp.ac.sg>
  for the hint.

ncpfs-0.18 -> ncpfs-0.19

- hacked around in ncplib.[ch] quite heavily.
- SAP handling in ipxparse.c. Thanks to Jeff Buhrt <buhrt@iquest.net>
- Changed error handling to use the com_err library. This should
  eventually provide better error messages, because it's now much
  easier to define nice messages.
- If no server is active, report this correctly
- added nsend

ncpfs-0.17 -> ncpfs-0.18

- Another attempt at solving the problem that -n is not working.
- Forgot nprint in 0.17 util/Makefile.
- nprint left connections open when it fails
- added options -r and -t to ncpmount to tune ncpfs connections.

ncpfs-0.16 -> ncpfs-0.17

- Changed the name of fsinfo to nwfsinfo, to avoid a name clash with
  the X windows utility. Thanks to Henning Brockfeld
  <Henning.Brockfeld@lrz.uni-muenchen.de> for this hint. (still
  waiting for your scripts.. :-))
- made nwmsg available. This enables you to receive NetWare user
  broadcast messages. Please note that you need at least kernel 1.3.68
  for this feature.
- pserver now prints debugging output via syslog().
- Included ipxdump, a nice little utility, that has helped some
  people.

- And now the big one: you can re-export ncpfs-mounted directories
  with nfsd! You have to mount single volumes by specifying -V volume
  to ncpmount, and call nfsd and mountd with the option --re-export.  
  See the manual page of ncpmount for more information. Please note
  that I will send Linus the required patch on 1. March 1996, so you
  will have to use kernel 1.2.13 or wait at least for 1.3.70.

ncpfs-0.15 -> ncpfs-0.16

- Included ipx-1.0, made available by Greg Page <greg@caldera.com>,
  Caldera
- Made -n work for password-less accounts. Thanks to Alexander Jolk
  <jolk@ap-pc513b.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de>.
- Fixed the kerneld support.
- Fixed the NetWare 4.1 problem. Many thanks to
  Chatchai JANTARAPRIM <chat@ratree.psu.ac.th> and 
  hitesh.soneji@industry.net for their patience.

ncpfs-0.14 -> ncpfs-0.15

- A bug fixed that made normal mounting impossible. It was too late
  yesterday. Sorry
- Manpage for pserver.c

ncpfs-0.13 -> ncpfs-0.14

- Improvements of manual pages by B. Galliart <bgallia@luc.edu> and
  Terry Dawson <terry@perf.no.itg.telecom.com.au>
- fsinfo
- pserver.c. Please see this as ALPHA software. There is no
  documentation, and it is not tested enough. But it might be useful for
  you. 

ncpfs-0.12 -> ncpfs-0.13

- support for automatic loading of ncpfs.o by kerneld.
  Thanks to Steven N. Hirsch <hirsch@emba.uvm.edu>.
- A subtle problem in the read routines has been removed by Uwe Bonnes
  <bon@elektron.ikp.physik.th-darmstadt.de>. Thanks a lot.
