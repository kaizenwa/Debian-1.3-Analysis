fixmount is a variant of showmount(8) that can delete bogus
mount  entries  in  remote  mountd(8C) daemons.  I find it particularly
useful in conjunction with automounters that frequently leave a remote
mountd's idea of what's NFS mounted and the actual mounts out of sync.
See the man page for details.

The code is tested on SunOS4.x and 5.3, NeXT 1.0 and 2.1, Ultrix 4.x, 
IRIX4.0.x and 5.x, and DEC OSF/1 2.0.  The following things need editing in
the Makefile (unless you have pmake):

* Some systems need a replacement for the missing ualarm() timer.
* Some also don't bind their RPC sockets to reserved ports by default,
  in which case a modified clnt_generic.c module from the Sun RPC4.0
  distribution needs to be linked in.
* SVR4 needs -DSVR4 and linking with -lsocket -lnsl. The reserved port stuff
  in SunOS5.x seems to require linking with /usr/ucblib/librpcsoc.so as well.
  Don't know about other SVR4 systems.

fixrmtab is shell hack to invalidate rmtab entries on the local machine.
mountd needs to be restarted for changes to take effect.
