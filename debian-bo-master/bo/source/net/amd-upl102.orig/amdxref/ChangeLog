	Added some code to parser to make it better.  The YACC
        stuff needs to be dropped and just use a pure C code.

        Added `fstree.c' which keeps track of a virtual
        directory tree, from which a report is generated
        on the "read-write"/"read-only"-ness at each
        "possible" mount point.

	Out with the YACC parser.  parser.c now does all the
	parsing.

	Think I handle leading '-' correctly now.

	Fixed bug in 'chario.c'... this must have been the
	cause of the problems with YACC (as opposed to Bison).

	Uncommented '.' & '/' handling in variable expansion.
