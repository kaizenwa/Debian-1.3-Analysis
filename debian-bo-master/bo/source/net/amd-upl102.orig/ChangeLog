Wed Mar 22 17:46:02 1995  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  <ezk@shekel.mcl.cs.columbia.edu>

	* Released amd-upl102.

	* Added small patch from greg@duke.CS.UNLV.EDU (Greg Wohletz)
	for Ultrix 4.4.

Mon Mar 20 15:08:10 1995  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  <ezk@shekel.mcl.cs.columbia.edu>

	* Privately released amd-upl101.

	* Added patch to amq from Bob Drzyzgula <m1rcd00@FRB.GOV> that
	fixes amq -M on Solaris 2.4 (and probably other svr4 systems).

	* Included changes to default config/Makefile.irix[45] makefiles
	from Andreas Stolcke.

	* Added a minor fix to contrib/automount2amd.awk from
	Philippe-Andre Prindeville <philipp@res.enst.fr>.

Wed Mar  8 20:37:33 1995  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  <ezk@shekel.mcl.cs.columbia.edu>

	* Privately released amd-upl98.

	* Added patch from Andreas Stolcke which fixes fixes as heap
	corruption problem when using "opts" with prepended "-".  See
	amd/am_ops.c.

	* Added patch from Brent Callaghan for Solaris/Sunos compatibility
	(see config/os-sos5.h).

Wed Mar  1 17:55:58 1995  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  <ezk@shekel.mcl.cs.columbia.edu>

	* Privately released AMD unofficial-patchlevel 96.

	* Completed port to FreeBSD 2.x.

	* amd/mount_fs.c: fixed problem in new patch from Stolke which
	prevented compiling on some systems that undef'ed MOUNT_TRAP and
	used UMOUNT_FS instead, such as osf1.

	* Minor fixes to get hlfsd to compile on NextStep 3.0.

	* config/mtab_svr4.c: now using MTAB_LOCK_FILE.  This defaults to
	/etc/.mtab.lock, and for Solaris 2.4 it's defined as
	/etc/.mnttab.lock (in Makefile.i86pc_sos5_5.4 and
	Makefile.local.sun4_sos5_5.4).

	* Changed ifdef of symlink-cache fooling code to
	HAVE_SYMLINK_CACHE.  Added config/Makefile.i86pc_sos5_5.4 and
	config/Makefile.sun4_sos5_5.4.  These two define -DSOLARIS_2_4 in
	the ${DEBUG} variable so that the symlink cache is automatically
	disabled under Solaris 2.4.  Also for Irix, there's no need to use
	the HAVE_SYMLINK_CACHE code if NFSMNT_SYMTTL is defined.

	* updated config/os-version so irix does not run uname -v as part
	of the name of the A.* directory.

Tue Feb 14 09:39:23 1995 Rens Troost <rens@imsi.com>

	* released upl90

	* incorporated latest fixmount from <stolcke@ICSI.Berkeley.EDU>.

	* integrated patches from <ezk@cs.columbia.edu> which fool the
	  Solaris 2.4 symlink cache to think the values are always new
	  for amd and hlfsd.

	  workaround to amd coredump when inheriting a direct map entry
	  pointing into automounted namespace.

	* Included patch from Andreas Stolcke <stolcke@ICSI.Berkeley.EDU>
	  cleans up TIRPC interface and makes spurce port on mountd calls
	  go out over priveleged port, allowing svr4 interoperability with
	  SunOS 4.x.

	* Included patch from Steinar Haug <Steinar.Haug@runit.sintef.no>
	  to prevent amd from losing track of it's child processes and
	  hanging under heavy load.

	* Integrated patch from Douglas L. Acker <acker@se01.wg2.waii.com>
	  amd now designates automounts as such in the mtab with
	  "map=<mapname>" option, furthering Sun Automount compatibility.

	* Released upl77.

	* Fixed bugs in wire.c which prevented wire-test/amd from running
	on Solaris 2.4 (x86).

	* Included my LISA-7 paper on hlfsd with the next upl release.

	* Fixed lots of hlfsd portability problems.

Wed Sep 29 11:28:05 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Included patch from Mike Mitchell <mcm@unx.sas.com>, which fixes
	many small problems.  Patch collection file is in
	patches/used/mcm-2.

	* Included patch from chk@alias.com (C. Harald Koch) which removes
	unnecessary pings when using type:=host and restarting filesystems.
	Patch file is in patches/used/host_ops-ping-1.  Then included a
	slightly improved patch for the same problem, which is in
	patches/used/host_ops-ping-2 -- same author.

	* Fixed a $PATH problem in config/arch which after checking for an
	arch program in a particular order, executed it from a different
	search path.

	* Rewrote parts of broken code in host_ops.c for svr4/solaris.
	This avoids the use of obsoleted rpc_soc calls.

Tue Sep 28 10:35:19 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Included patch from Andy Chittenden <asc@concurrent.co.uk> which
	fixes problems with host_ops for solaris/svr4.  Patch file is in
	patches/used/sos5-host_ops.

	* Included contributed files from Andy Chittenden
	<asc@concurrent.co.uk> which lets you build a solaris packages for
	amd, and the startup script for /etc/init.d/.  Patch file is in
	patches/used/svr4-pkg.

	* Included patch from Bob Hatcher (rrh@chevron.com) to allow
	setting pref:=null.  Patch file is in patches/used/null-prefix.

	* Included and tested support for cdfs, pcfs, and lofs for
	Solaris.  Included support for cdfs and pcfs for hpux-9, but only
	tested cdfs.

	* Fixed some signal-handling code for hlfsd.

Fri Sep 24 10:54:26 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Renamed hsfs to cdfs, a more general name.

	* Fixed Makefile bugs which prevented wire-test/hlfsd from
	building on hpux9.

	* Fixed many bugs in hlfsd port to hpux-9.  Bugs fixes for non-hpux
	as well.

Tue Sep 14 19:37:36 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Fixed problem on sos5 where amd would hang on machines that did
	not run mountd.  Amd now creates a CLIENT * handle to rpcbind
	instead of mountd (just as ok.)

	* Completely ported hlfsd to solaris 2.2 and hpux-9.01.  Included
	new man page, a few new features, and a paper (to be published in
	LISA-VII.)

Mon Aug 23 00:01:08 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Added filesystem disk space/quota exceeded tests for hlfsd.

	* Included patch from neal@ctd.comsat.com (Neal Becker) which
	fixes port of hlfsd to hpux.  Patch file in
	patches/used/hlfsd-hpux-seteuid.

	* Released upl67.

Sun Aug 22 22:29:47 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Included patch from Dan Mosedale <mosedale@genome.stanford.edu>
	which fixes minor warnings from texinfo.  Patch file in
	patches/used/amdref.texinfo-2.

	* Included patch from Andy Chittenden <asc@concurrent.co.uk> which
	fixes nisplus_info.c.  Patch file in patches/used/nisplus-4.

	* Included patch from Andy Chittenden <asc@concurrent.co.uk> which
	fixes nis_info.c for RTU machines.  Patch file in
	patches/used/info-nis-rtu.

	* Completed port of amd/amq/hlfsd to pure SVR4 code!!! -Erez

Mon Aug  9 19:11:18 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Included patch from Andy Chittenden <asc@concurrent.co.uk> that
	improves nis+ code for Solaris.  It allows one to tell amd if you
	have nis+ at all, and if you have nis+ maps, using a second
	variable.  Look in config/os-sos5.h.  Patch file in
	patches/used/nisplus-3.

	* Included patch from Mitchum DSouza <m.dsouza@mrc-apu.cam.ac.uk>
	that adds more porting support for linux, as well as ports to
	hpux9 and linux for hlfsd.  Patch file in
	patches/used/linux-hlfsd-2.

	* Included patch from Mitchum DSouza <m.dsouza@mrc-apu.cam.ac.uk>
	to make hlfsd build cleaner on hpux 9.x and linux.  Patch file is
	in patches/used/hlfsd-1.

	* HP-UX 9.0.1: fixed config/arch script, turned on NFS_4 and
	ported the code when using NFS_4, using either cc or gcc.

	* Changed solaris' mount type to "nfs" and added an "ignore" to
	the afs default mount options.  That's how solaris automounters
	are supposed to do it so that df does not report amd mount points
	by default.

	* Changed default mount type for hpux 9.x to "ignore" so bdf works
	better.

Tue Jul 20 17:16:00 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Fixed porting problems for HP-UX 6.5.

Fri Jul 16 18:21:40 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Released upl61.

Thu Jul 15 20:11:45 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Changed all references to memcpy() to memmove().  Memmove()
	deals with overlapping buffers (as bcopy() does) where memcpy()
	does not.

	* Included patch for extending fsinfo's syntax to allow overriding
	of mount options.  Patch file from clarsen@ux5.lbl.gov (Case
	Larsen) is in patches/used/fsinfo-extend-1.

	* Included patch for SunOS 3.x on sun-3s.  Patch file from
	tschmidt@pefs1.micron.com (Tom Schmidt) is in
	patches/used/sun3-sos3.

	* Included small fix for Makefile.osf1 so that it compiles with
	standard make programs.  Patch file from Jim Belonis
	<belonis@dirac.phys.washington.edu> is in
	patches/used/alpha-osf1-nislib.

	* Included patch which provides NIS+ (NIS version 3) support for
	Solaris 2.2.  The code is unverified so far.  Patch is from Andy
	Chittenden <asc@concurrent.co.uk> in patches/used/nisplus-2.

Tue Jul 13 12:44:19 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Included port to irix 5.0.x.  Patch from srp@cgl.ucsf.edu (Scott
	Presnell) in patches/used/irix5.

	* Included patch which avoids core dumps when unmounting an nfsx.
	Patch from Sanjay (sanjay@lcs.mit.edu) is in
	patches/used/efs-umounted.

	* Included port to linux, from 	Mitchum D'Souza
	<m.dsouza@mrc-apu.cam.ac.uk>.  Patch file is in
	patches/used/linux.

	* Based on the lofs-escapes patch, I've added hsfs (cd-rom
	filesystem) and pcfs (ms-dos filesystem.)

	* Added lofs, a loopback filesystem type, and enhancements to
	recognize escaped sequences in amd maps ala \000, \n, etc.  Patch
	file from christos@deshaw.com (Christos Zoulas) is in
	patches/used/lofs-escapes.

	* Turned off verbose errors when using linkx fstype.  Patch file
	from wpm@is.morgan.com (W. Phillip Moore) is in
	patches/used/linkx-plog-errors.

Fri Jul  9 13:50:58 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Added HAS_PLOCK to os-sos5.h and os-rtu6.h as per Andy
	Chittenden <asc@concurrent.co.uk>.  Patch file in
	patches/used/plock-sos5-rtu6.  I then also decided to add
	HAS_PLOCK to os-sos4.h.

	* If HPUX_9 then don't turn off OS_HAS_NDBM, because HP-UX 9.0 has
	it.  Patch from neal@ctd.comsat.com (Neal Becker) in
	patches/used/hpux9-has-ndbm.

Wed Jul  7 16:57:03 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Included two new contributed perl scripts in the contrib/ dir:
	amdls.pl from jgd@acl.lanl.gov (Jerry G. DeLapp) and
	automount2amd.pl from mike@tab00.larc.nasa.gov (Mike Walker).

	* Included patch from Andy Chittenden <asc@concurrent.co.uk> which
	fixes amd hangs on Solaris 2.2.  Patch file is in
	patches/used/sos5.2-sig-hang.

Wed Jun 16 11:57:05 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Released upl49.

	* Added code dealing with systems that have a broken NIS
	implementation of yp_all().   The NIS bug is triggered if you are
	using NIS maps, and -cache:=all.  Either get your vendors to fix
	the NIS bugs, or compile amd with BROKEN_YP_ALL.

	* Changed plog to dlog in amd/opts.c for "found first assignment
	past selectors", as per <Piete.Brooks@cl.cam.ac.uk> suggestion.

Tue Jun 15 18:31:46 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Removed redundant check for "/defaults" in NEW_TOPLVL_READDIR
	code.

Fri Jun 11 17:55:38 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Released upl48.

	* Included patches to upl48 from <Piete.Brooks@cl.cam.ac.uk>.
	Mostly osf and ultrix 3.0 stuff.  See
	patches/used/piete-brooks-upl45.

Thu Jun 10 10:48:56 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Updated fixmount code with new one from Andreas Stolcke
	(stolcke@icsi.berkeley.edu).  See
	patches/used/stolcke-fixmount.shar-2.

	* Included small patches for osf1/alpha from Sanjay
	<sanjay@lcs.mit.edu>.  See patches/used/osf1-sanjay.

	* fixed _void type in hlfsd/homedir.c

Wed Jun  9 20:50:48 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Released upl45.

	* renamed logfile to amq_logfile in amq/amq.c because aix 3.2's cc
	complains.

Tue Jun  8 03:39:18 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Added caching to hlfsd, fixed alignment problem.  Began porting
	to other architectures.

Sun Jun  6 01:03:57 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Fixed code to allow amd to reopen it's log file.  This is so
	daily amd log files can be rotated, purged, etc.  Amd always kept
	an open file-descriptor and log files just kept on growing.  So I,
	turned back on code for "amq -l".  The code was off probably
	because it was insecure.  However, I changed amd/amq_subr.c so
	that "amq -l" can only change to the same log file "amd -l" was
	started with.  In effect, it does not change the log file, just
	closes the old one and reopens it, establishing a new file-handle.

Sat Jun  5 21:30:04 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Implemented $osver, defining the version of the operating system
	amd is running on.  It is hardcoded by default as whatever the
	config/os-version script finds out, but an amd command line
	option, -o, overrides it.  The override is necessary since
	although operating system versions change, amd is (and many other
	binaries in general are) still capable of running.

	* Corrected dependency of mount_fs.c on all possible files that
	can be defined in MOUNT_HELPER_SOURCE.  Created a variable in
	amd/Makefile.amd called MOUNT_HELPER_SRCS to which
	config/mount_*.c should be added.

	* Enhanced parsing of /defaults entries.  The new code allows
	selectors as part of multi-line entries in /defaults.  This is
	useful to select different defaults depending on architecture,
	karch, host name, etc.  This code is still experimental so you
	must compile amd with -DNEW_DEFAULTS.

Fri May 28 17:03:17 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Enhanced toplvl's readdir function to list all possible entries
	that are available.  You can now list names of keys before they
	get automounted.  To get the code, you must compile with
	-DNEW_TOPLVL_READDIR.  The code is very simplistic and hardly
	tested.  It only works well for -cache:=all.

Thu May 27 14:20:25 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Copied a couple of utility shell-scripts from Case Larsen
	<clarsen@ux6.lbl.gov> to the contrib directory.  The shar file is
	called toamd+fstab-export-to-fsinfo.shar, and contains two script
	that help in building fsinfo maps from the fstab and exports
	files.  Untested.

	* Created a directory "contrib" under the amd top-level, to hold
	some contributed stuff that may not fit anywhere else and/or was
	untested.

	* Included patch to speed up mounts for amd from Sam Horrocks
	<sam@ics.uci.edu>.   See patches/used/mount-speedup-1

Wed May 26 22:30:52 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Included fix to mount type nfsx from Andreas Stolcke
	<stolcke@ICSI.Berkeley.EDU> which informs the remote mountd.  See
	patches/used/nfsx-inform-mountd-1.

Fri May 21 11:16:45 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Included most of JSP's changes which made it to
	amd930325b.tar.Z.  I changed a few things so it fits the other
	patches I included.  Most of JSP's changes were for osf1, and code
	cleanup.  I've created a context diff file between my upl28
	version on amd930325b in patches/used/jsp-amd930325b.

	* Included patch from clauberg@rrz.uni-koeln.de (Axel Clauberg).
	It fixes __osf__ port with respect to signal handling.  See the
	patch file patches/used/alpha-defined__osf1__.

	* Included patch from Sanjay Ghemawat <sanjay@thor.lcs.mit.edu>.
	It adds a port to "vanilla" BSD 4.3.  It does not look like this
	patch will conflict with the bsd44 port.  See the patch file
	patches/used/vax-bsd-4.3.

	* Included patch from <hakanson@bogart.cse.ogi.edu> Marion
	Hakanson.  It adds better recognition for sos4 and sos5 in
	os-type.  Not all of the patch was used.  See the patch file
	patches/used/os-type-sos5.

	* Included patch from Raphael Finkel <raphael@ms.uky.edu>.  It
	fixes some definitions for Ultrix 4.1.  See the patch file
	patches/used/ultrix_4_1.

	* Included patch from <hakanson@bogart.cse.ogi.edu> Marion
	Hakanson.  It fixes a locking problem with the mtab file in sos5.
	See patches/used/mtab-sos5.

	* Ported to HP-UX 9.01.  Several patches were taken from various
	people.  See patches/used/hpux-9.0.1-first.  Made sure no changes
	break other compilations.  Also ported the code to compile with
	gcc-2.3.3.

Thu May 20 15:16:03 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk@okeeffe)

	* Added support for using Makefile.${ARCH}_${OS}_${OSVER}.  I
	found it useful for placing special compilation rules for HPUX
	9.01 without changing or breaking compilations for other hpux
	versions.

Wed May 19 14:25:38 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Added rtu6 patch from <asc@slough.concurrent.co.uk>.  The patch
	file is in patches/used/rtu6.

	* Ported amd to an OKI-7330 running AOI 4.0 (and i860 machine with
	an SVR4 port.)  This was used to verify the "purity" of the svr4
	port.  Just has one problem with wire.c which is attributed to the
	OKI.

	* Confirmed that amd builds and runs when compiled with Sun's
	unbundled C compiler (SC2.0.1) for Solaris 2.1.  Added
	instructions in Makefile.sos5.

Tue May 18 13:11:11 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk at shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Converted sos5 port to use as much as the "vanilla" svr4 files
	and configuration.

	* Removed sos5 (Solaris 2.1, SunOS 5.1) dependency on libucb in
	/usr/ucblib and libelf in /usr/lib.  Still need librpcsoc because
	otherwise sockets calls in Solaris will assume TLI behavior by
	default.

Fri Feb 12 17:21:21 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk@shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Changed wire.c code to recognize a subsidiary network.  Using
	new variable names: primnetname, primnetnum, subsnetname, and
	subsnetnum.  Old names wire, network and netnumber are left there
	for backward compatibility but will be removed in future releases.
	These old names refer to the primary network

Fri Feb  5 01:36:21 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk@shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Added the svr4 port by rouilj@sni-usa.com (John Rouillard).  His
	port was based on my Solaris 2.1 port so it looks very much
	identical.

Thu Feb  4 15:25:42 1993  Erez "HWank1" Zadok  (ezk@shekel.cs.columbia.edu)

	* Added rpc-trash (which was originally rejected) after several
	people found it useful.  The patch came from  George D. M. Ross
	<gdmr@dcs.ed.ac.uk>.  The patch file is in
	patches/used/rpc-trash.

	* Added amdxref-1.03 as part of the upl distribution.  Untested.
