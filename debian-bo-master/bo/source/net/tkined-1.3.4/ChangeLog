Fri Sep 22 18:01:14 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Editor.tcl:
	  Added some tkined.defaults variables that control the
	  options menu.

Thu Sep 14 11:12:09 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Editor.tcl:
	  Always display the color menu. This seems to work fine as
	  Tk4.0 maps all colors to black on a monochrome display.	

	* Objects.tcl:
	  Added a INTERPRETER::delete proc to handle errors while
	  a new interpreter is created. <jaques@lsil.com>

Wed Sep  6 21:30:36 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Tool.tcl: 
	  You can now add attributes to LINK objects. John P. Rouillard
 	  <rouilj@dstar.iddis.com> requested this feature.

Mon Aug 28 12:44:03 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Command.tcl (Command::RemoveGroup):
	  Links are now automatically removed from a group if the
	  src or dst of the link is removed from a group.

	* Command.tcl (Command::Close), Editor.tcl:
	  Added a Close command proc. It will check for the confirmExit
	  attribute and issue a dialog for people with slow machines.

	* configure.in:
	  Added a --with-blt configure option to avoid problems
	  with broken or old blt libraries.

Fri Aug 25 00:55:13 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Tool.tcl (Tool::MakePopup):
	  Various changes to define shortcuts to commands by adding
	  them to the popup menu.

	* configure.in:
	  Cache include and library paths between configure runs.

Tue Aug 22 20:13:14 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@helios>

	* stripchart.c (DisplayStripchart), barchart.c (DisplayBarchart):
	  Fixed a bug where the first scale line was drawn below the
	  bounding box. The solution is simple: Never draw the first
	  scale line.

Mon Aug 14 10:29:15 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Makefile.in:
	  Various changes to allow compilation in other directories
	  using the VPATH and SRC_DIR variables.

Wed Aug  9 12:35:40 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Command.tcl:
	  Fixed a bug in the SelectLabel proc. It did not find
	  the label associated with an icon.

Thu Jul 27 14:04:52 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Tool.tcl:
	  Button-2 on the canvas background now allows to move the
	  whole map.

Tue Jul 18 17:20:02 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Editor.tcl, Objects.tcl:
	  Changed the accelerater bindings to avoid any conflicts
	  with standard emacs editing bindings.

Mon Jun 26 19:36:04 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* stripchart.c (DisplayStripchart)
	  barchart.c (DisplayBarchart):
	  Fixed the code to not draw more striplines than can be 
	  displayed on the X server.

Fri Jun 16 00:11:50 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* methods.c (m_interpreter_create):
	  We now use Tcl_CreatePipeline() to start applications.

	* Editor.tcl:
	  An ugly binding to process X11 destroy events.

Thu Jun 15 15:40:29 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Objects.tcl:
	  Added a wrap option to the LOG object and make no wrap
	  the default.

Sun Jun  4 13:29:49 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Tool.tcl
	  Resizing strip- or barcharts is now working again. Reference
	  objects can be opened in a new or in the current view.

Wed May 10 15:09:38 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* editor.c (do_dump), methods.c (m_expand):
	  Empty groups are handled correctly now.

Sun May  7 14:23:25 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Editor.tcl (Editor::postscript):
	  Now always dump the complete map (-x and -y options added).

Thu May  4 13:34:51 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* tkined.defaults:
	  Renamed all bitmaps from *.bm to *.xbm.

	* tkined.h, method.h, objects.h:
	  Turned the internally used Tcl lists into pointer arrays
	  to make the C code faster and easier to write.

	* Tool.tcl:
	  Removed the code to alter the label on the canvas. Use the
	  Edit Attributes command provided by the popup menu instead.

	* Tool.tcl:
	  Started to change the default bindings on the canvas. I also
	  turned the Alter tool into a Resize tool as the old alter
	  functionality is now in the right mouse binding.

Mon Apr  3 19:00:59 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Tool.tcl:
	  Fixed Tool::Find to only accept items near the cursor.

Sat Mar 25 16:45:45 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Started to convert Tkined to the Tcl/Tk coding styles.
	  Made Tkined compile with tk4.0b3.

Thu Mar 23 20:00:18 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* methods.c (m_delete):
	  Added a call to parent_resize(). Otherwise, an expanded
	  group wont be resized if a member is deleted.

Sun Mar 19 12:11:46 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* stripchart.c (StripchartValues), barchart.c (BarchartValues):
	  Fixed a free(NULL) problem.

Sat Mar 18 17:34:06 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Replaced all xmalloc() calls etc. with ckalloc() etc.

Sat Feb  4 11:50:39 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* HTML.tcl:
	  Some initial code to display some basic html tags. Needs
	  a lot of more work.

	* html.c:
	  A very simple html parser. It splits up a tagged text and 
	  returns a Tcl list of tag/text pairs. Allows incremental
	  html parsing as the stack of open tags is returned to the
	  caller.

	* methods.c (m_flash):
	  Flash all the parents of an object if an object is invisible.
          This makes collapsed groups flashing if one of its member 
          is flashing.

Sun Jan 29 11:30:25 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Objects.tcl:
	  Text views now save the current directory in the filename 
	  attribute.

	* tkined.h:
	  The command buffer is now dynamically allocated. This saves
	  about 200 bytes for most tkined objects.

	* Editor.tcl, Command.tcl:
	  Renamed the view menu to an option menu and added a locking
	  mode that allows to protect a map agains modifications.

Sat Jan 28 19:38:15 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Added HTML and DATA objects. HTML objects will replace
	  the LOG object and DATA objects will be used to replace
	  STRIPCHART, BARCHART and GRAPH objects.

Sat Jan  7 13:16:47 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Added expand/collapse to the group alter popup menu.

Thu Jan  5 19:28:15 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Reworked some menus to make them more uniform.

	* Replaced the button on the LOG windows with a menu bar.

	* Ported most stuff to tk4.0. Removed the compat directory,
	  removed the em_bind.tcl code and rewrote many pieces of
	  tcl code to work with tk4.0.

Wed Jan  4 13:05:02 1995  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* editor.c (e_readhistory): 
	  Fixed the fclose bug which caused some core dumps.

Mon Dec 19 18:55:51 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* tkined-1.2.0

	* Moved the initialization tcl code into init.tcl which
	  load site/init.tcl to allow site specific customization.

Thu Dec  8 22:15:05 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Changed the dialogs to show the default button on the left
	  side (where most people expect it ...)

	* Fixed a minor memory leak in do_ined().

	* Interpreter started while loading a saved maps are destroyed
	  when the view is cleared.

	* Added the history command to the File menu as I was
	  tired of typing file names or using the ugly file 
	  selector.

Sun Dec  4 12:43:27 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Read tkined.defaults from /usr/local/lib/tkined/ and
	  /usr/local/lib/tkined/site/ to allow site specific
	  definitions.

Sat Dec  3 22:56:31 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Changed the installation procedure: bitmaps files are
	  copied to /usr/local/lib/tkined/bitmaps and applications
	  are searched in /usr/local/lib/tkined/apps.

Sun Nov 20 17:34:11 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@sol>

	* Updated the configure scripts to autoconf-2.1.

Tue Nov  1 15:24:24 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Added a --with-auto-load option which will setup a
	  Makefile that builds a tkined binary which loads the
	  *.tcl files during startup. Useful for tkined hackers.

Thu Oct 27 11:32:09 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Added a new object type called GRAPH. A GRAPH object is
          shown using the BLT extension (required to use GRAPH objects)
	  to draw xy graphs in a diagram window.

	* Fixed a quoting bug that killed labels with " characters.
	  There were also some error returns missing. This may break
	  scripts that expect that ined commands never return an 
	  error. These scripts may need some fixing, sorry.

Wed Oct 26 11:23:04 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Fixed the initialization of a new interpreter object so
	  that exiting processes do not talk to tkined at all are
	  handled correctly.

Fri Oct  7 16:39:09 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@orpheus>

	* Added a terminal server icon that was listed in tkined.defaults
	  but not really available.

Thu Sep 29 23:37:46 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@data>

	* Added a join and leave command to the structure menu
	  to allow modifications of the group member relationship.

	* Added m_parent() and a parent command.

	* Fixed the handling of the TKINED_PATH search path.

Fri Sep 23 18:33:47 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  <schoenw@sol>

	* Hacked m_member to add and remove objects to an 
	  existing group. Needs some speed up and some tk
	  code to be usable.

Tue Sep  6 20:40:54 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Replaced the 'random placement' proc tkined_makemenu in 
	  Editor.tcl for creating submenus with a working version.

Thu Sep  1 11:16:49 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Fixed the broken dialog in tkined_print.

	* Check the header of saved tkined files for the magic words
	  tkined version to make sure we load something reasonable.

	* Fixed the LOG::save method. The dialog asking how to handle
	  existing files did not appear. I also added an option to
	  append to an existing file.

Mon Aug 29 09:52:06 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Always initialize the color attribute with black and the 
	  font attribute to fixed. Some applications got confused
	  with empty colors.

Sun Aug 28 20:23:32 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Fixed a race condition in flash.c that stopped flashing
	  sometimes.

Sat Aug 27 13:36:12 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Changed the icon flash code to use the color of an object
	  if running on a color display.

	* Overlapping icons were not handled correctly in the Alter
	  and Link tools. I rewrote the code to find the topmost 
	  object on the canvas.

	* Fixed a bug in Editor::postscript. The postscript proc tried
	  to set the outline color of a text instead of the clipbox.

Fri Aug 26 16:26:03 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* tkined-1.0

Thu Aug 25 15:35:19 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@helios)

	* Changing colors on strip- and barchart now works. This allows
	  me to flash strip- and barcharts.

Wed Aug 24 18:48:40 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Added dialogs to the alter tool that can be used to create,
	  edit or delete attributes for an object.

Mon Aug 22 13:38:24 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Renamed the ida and idb link attributes to src and dst.

Fri Aug 12 11:37:27 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Rewrote Objects.tcl which is now much smaller and at least
	  as fast as the old version.

	* Changed tkined to always use X11 font name, X11 color
	  names and bitmap file names internally. This makes saved
	  maps independent of user defined menus.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* Removed the 'ined text' command for all objects other
	  than text objects. Use the generic attribute commmand
	  instead.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Fri Aug 12 00:19:49 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Converted strip- and barcharts to real objects. They can't
	  be linked anymore.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* Added a flash command to let tkined flash icons. This can be
	  used by applications to indicate error state on color and
	  monochrome displays.

	* Added a generic attribute command to let applications
	  define any attribute they need.

Fri Aug  5 08:36:03 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Renamed TOOL objects to MENU to get rid of the old
	  naming convention that was a little bit crazy.

	* Renamed the tcl source files.

	* Fixed a bug that affected links with one fixed point.

Thu Aug  4 12:34:13 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Fixed some minor bugs which make multi line labels work.

	* Renamed the procs in tkined_tool.tcl. All tool names
	  conform to the format Tool::<toolname> which increases
	  readability.

	* Added an 'ined text' command to set the text attribute
	  of node, group, network and reference objects. I also
	  changed the 'ined label' command to not accept a text
	  argument anymore.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* Moved the Label submenu to the structure menu and the
	  grid commands from the structure to the edit menu.

Tue Aug  2 16:21:51 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Added code to close unused file descriptors after forking
	  a new process.

	* Added a socketpair(2) replacement using pipe(2) for SCO 
          based on a patch by Juergen Luksch (luksch@telenet.de).

	* Changed the syntax of the ined request command. The
	  last argument is now a list of buttons that should
          appear below the text given by the other args. This
          makes dialogs more flexible. I also added support
	  for check button.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* Changed the syntax of the ined list command. The
	  last argument is now a list of buttons that should
          appear below the text given by the other args. This
          makes dialogs more flexible.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Mon Aug  1 15:12:28 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Changed the syntax of the ined confirm command. The
	  last argument is now a list of buttons that should
	  appear below the text given by the other args. This
	  makes dialogs more flexible.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***	  

Sat Jul 30 16:53:27 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Renamed the commands to conform to the format
	  Command::<cmdname>, which increases readability.

Mon Jul 25 18:52:51 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Added an 'ined stripchart <id> jump <num>' command
	  to set how much pixels are scrolled. Fixed a bug
	  that did not allow to put objects on the border of
	  the page.

Fri Jul 22 13:51:13 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Added a new `ined postscript' command. This allows an
	  application to retrieve the current map in graphical
	  format and to convert it to something like gif using
	  ghostscript. The implementation add a new method 
	  e_postscript() to an editor object.

Tue Jul 19 16:59:06 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* tkined-0.9i

Mon Jul 18 15:34:25 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* For every trace written to an interpreter we call tk's
	  update command to process incoming ined queue messages.
	  This is *very* slow but I don't know how to fix this
	  problem without changing the protocol.

	* Added a check to expand() to ignore unnecessary calls
	  to methods that won't change anything.

Thu Jul 14 01:20:27 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Removed trace_s() and trace_sl() and rewrote the trace()
	  function. This is the generic solution.

	* Added some new functions trace_s and trace_sl to write
	  trace messages with appended strings and appended lists
	  correctly by using DStrings.

Tue Jul 12 15:16:16 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Labels written to the text attribute of objects are
	  stored when a map is dumped.

	* Changed some dump functions to append proper list
	  elements. This solves some problems with strings
	  containing quote characters.

	* Changed the dump functions to save the data stored in
	  strip- or barcharts. This allows me to connect to a
	  tkined editor and download the current status.

Fri Jul  8 00:03:08 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Objects can now be alligned on a grid using two new
	  commands: 'Set Grid Spacing' and 'Align to Grid'.
	  (I can't remember how I lived without them :-)

	* Added a width and height attribute to tkined.defaults
	  that defines the initial size of the tkined window.

Wed Jul  6 10:21:27 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* There is a new ined command that generates a sequence
	  of tcl statements to rebuild an arbitrary object. The
	  syntax is `ined dump <id>' and returns a single line.
	  The contents is the same as used to write tkined map 
	  files.

	* Added a -notrace option to the ined commands.

	* Replaced some calls to Tcl_Eval by calling the C function
	  directly. Also added lappend() and ldelete() to make list
	  handling of object references faster.

Mon Jul  4 19:15:06 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* The semantic of the ined send command was broken. If called
	  without further arguments, e.g. ined send foobar, tkined
	  appended the list of currently selected objects automatically.
	  This is not what we expect from it. Changed m_send().
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***   

	* Added a wrapper xwrite() to replace write() calls
	  with a more fail save version needed by some ugly
	  machines.

Fri Jun 24 23:25:20 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* Added a scale command to the edit menu to set the scale
	  factor used by strip- and barcharts. Also fixed a bug
	  in the scale tool which scaled always down to the maximum
	  value of a strip- or barchart.

Mon Jun 20 20:10:27 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@data)

	* Chanced the ined restart command. New commands will be replaced
          instead of appending them. A call without any arguments returns
	  the current list. This allows an application to add and remove
	  entries as it prefers.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Tue Jun  2 18:22:46 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* tkined-0.9e

Sat May 21 17:42:14 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@diana)

	* Added hierarchical menus to external tools using the
	  same syntax, e.g. "ined create TOOL foo bar:cmd1 bar:cmd2"
	  will create a submenu bar with containg the commands
	  cmd1 and cmd2.

	* Renamed the file select dialog to make it accessible
	  for applications that talk to tkined. There is now
	  an easy way to see and go back the directory path.

	* Added a button to freeze/melt a log window and replace
	  a call to regexp with something faster in C.

Sun May 15 20:41:38 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

        * tkined-0.9d

Sun May  1 18:48:25 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Set the scale factor in the scale dialog dynamically.

Sun Apr 17 23:08:51 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Added hierarchical menus to the icon, font and color menus.

Sun Apr 10 10:05:19 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Renamed the procs that implement the dialogs to 
	  Dialog::<type>. Additional dialogs can now be defined
	  by simply writing another Dialog::<type> proc.

Sat Apr  9 13:42:48 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Rearranged the code that dumps objects into asccii
	  strings. This makes the dump methods smaller.

Fri Mar 25 19:00:32 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Added the new object type REFERENCE.

Thu Mar 24 16:02:23 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Accept URL file names. A simple ftp interface allows
	  me to retrieve files via ftp and put it into tkined.

	* Added a new command to bind commands to text strings
	  in a LOG window.

	* The ined append command does not append a newline
	  character automatically anymore.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Wed Mar  9 20:07:43 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* tkined-0.9 released.

Sat Feb 26 16:35:39 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Removed ined.tcl from the tkined sources. It is now
	  part of scotty since it uses the scotty event loop.
	  Hence there is no reason to distribute it with tkined.

Thu Feb 24 19:00:51 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Added some code to check some buffer overflow conditions.
	  This should make tkined save even when used with very
	  large groups or while processing ined command with extremely
	  large arguments.

Tue Feb 22 11:36:17 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Changed the name of the default entries in tkined.defaults.
	  Node icons are now set using tkined.node entries and group
	  icons are set using tkined.group entries.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Sat Feb 19 15:07:42 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* tkined-0.8 (internal release only)

Fri Feb 18 16:26:24 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* The delete command on a group object now really deletes
	  the whole group. Previous versions simply ungrouped the
	  object, which is an error.

	* Any object can be a member of exactly one group. Previous
	  versions allowed to put one object into more than one group,
	  but they did not handle them correctly. Now tkined
	  enforces a strict hierarchy.
          *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Wed Feb 16 12:33:24 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@helios)

	* Fixed a bug in ined.tcl that sometimes delayed command
	  processing. The command buffer was not flushed after a
	  tkined command was received while the interpreter was
	  waiting for an ined ok or ined error message.

	* Added a new ined command: ined restart <args> writes
	  a command string to tkined. Tkined creates code to reinstall
	  running scripts when saving a configuration. The args will
	  be send to a restarted tkined interpreter to reinitialize
	  it. See the ip_monitor.tcl script on how to make use of this
	  feature.

	* Networks with one segment are now resizable using
	  the alter tool.

Tue Feb 15 14:36:45 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@helios)

	* Added a select by label command.

Fri Feb 11 20:49:36 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@helios)

	* Rewrote the clipboard handling. Now the editor has a
	  function to evaluate the clipboard. This mechanism is
	  also used to load a saved tkined map file.

Tue Feb  8 19:29:00 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Some minimal support for legal and letter page sizes.

	* Moved all menus provided by external interpreters into
	  the menu bar. Rearranged some menus in a new way to 
	  reduce the amount of space occupied in the menu bar.
	  And I added a command to hide and show the complete 
	  toolbox.

Sun Feb  6 19:43:29 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* The editor does not allow to move objects outside of 
	  the canvas anymore. But it is still possible to loose
	  objects when reducing the page size.

Fri Feb  4 15:24:56 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* Changed the naming convention: All tk procs that implement
	  methods of tkined objects are named using the convention
	  <TYPE>::<OPERATION>, e.g. the move operation is implemented
	  using NODE::move, GROUP::move, etc.

Wed Feb  2 01:29:30 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@hektor)

	* All tools and commands are called with an editor
	  argument. This makes coding of editor specific
	  commands in C straightforward.

	* Renamed the label tool. Now it is called alter tool
	  and supports altering of text objects and resizing
	  of strip- or barchart objects.

	* Updated the stripchart and barchart canvas item
	  written by Guntram Hueske (hueske@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de).

Sun Jan  9 18:13:14 1994  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* tkined-0.7 released.

	* Rewrote the m_group_move() and the m_collapse() methods
	  to speed things up.

Thu Dec 30 02:21:22 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Removed the piechart. It was never useful since you had
	  to guess the meaning of a slide. Better use barcharts.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* Added the new stripchart and barchart canvas item 
	  written by Guntram Hueske (hueske@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de).

Tue Dec 28 18:27:15 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Added a log object that creates a new top level window
	  which may be used to log information. The contents
	  can be saved or send via email to someone you love.

Mon Dec  6 11:08:38 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* The tcl part of tkined is now compiled into the binary.
	  This allows us to have multiple versions around and
	  hopefully solves some installation problems.

Tue Nov 23 23:15:29 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* The open command of the file menu now clears the current map.
	  The merge command can be used to add objects of another map.

Fri Oct  8 17:09:09 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* tkined-0.6 released.

Mon Oct  4 00:01:04 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* ined trace command added.

Sun Oct  3 13:40:44 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Changed the ined browse command to interpret the first
	  lines as headings. The text to browse must be contained
	  in the list of the last argument.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* Tools of exiting interpreters are silently removed.

Thu Sep 30 14:17:37 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@sol)

	* Support for scale and radio button in a request dialog.

	* Added Stefan Schoek's (schoek@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de) job 
	  scheduler added to the ined.tcl module.

Thu Sep 23 13:22:17 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* Print command added to the file menu.

Wed Sep 22 13:13:21 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* Most commands of utils.tcl are now in the tkined core.

Fri Sep 10 20:48:10 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@ra)

	* tkined-0.5a released (based on tk3.3 / tcl7.0)

Tue Aug 31 18:31:14 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@ra)

	* tkined-0.5 released.

	* The text of a text label is not saved anymore. This
	  seems useful to get rid of status messages generate
	  by external tools.

Mon Aug 23 23:36:38 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* Added the size command. It reports the size even if the
	  object is currently invisible. This is needed by the
	  network layout algorithms to allocate space for the object.

	* Changed the ined select command. There is now a select
	  and an unselect command. This is much easier to use then
	  a single command that toggles the selection state. The
	  command ined select clear is no longer allowed.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Sat Aug 21 19:52:55 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* The ined commands retrieve, select and delete are now
	  restricted to accept only a single argument.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Fri Aug 20 19:00:15 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* Move the proc's to compute the link position to C.
	  This makes tkined_misc obsolete. I took the time to 
	  change the algorithm a little bit. Links connected to
	  networks with fixed points now guess if they really 
	  should use horizontal or vertical lines.

Fri Aug 20 10:18:58 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw at sulu)

	* Menus defined in the tkined.defaults file now support
	  separators. This makes large menus a little more readable.

Thu Aug 19 19:38:02 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* 'ined create TOOL ...' now returns an id for the new
	  tool. To delete the tool, you now have to use the
	  standard command 'ined delete <id>'.
	  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Mon Aug 16 19:27:02 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* Hacked an ined procedure that is used when loading
	  saved images. It uses a global variable and a guess
	  for setting the canvas right. Ugly - but it works.

	* Rewrote tkined_mark_item in C to speed things up.
	  (Still slow on large selections but mainly because
	   I add so many new objects.)

Sun Aug 15 19:36:28 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* group, ungroup, expand and collapse are finished.

	* New NODE, NETWORK and GROUP objects always get a label.

	* The text tool now uses the correct color and font
	  when you type text.

	* Finished the re-implementation of the object handling
	  stuff as ordinary C code. This major step provides some
	  improvements:

	  -- tkined does not need the addinput patch anymore.

	  -- implementation of grouped objects is much easier
	     since objects save their state even if they are 
	     invisible.

	  -- speed up. moving critical parts (like computation
	     of the link position) to C code is now very easy.

Thu Jul 16 19:43:07 1993  Juergen Schoenwaelder  (schoenw@bayes)

	* tkined-0.4 released (first public release).
