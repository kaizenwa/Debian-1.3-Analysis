==> This is an EXPERIMENTAL version based on Tk4.0b4 and Tcl7.4b4.

This directory contains the source of tkined, an application
independent network editor. This version is a re-implementation of the
original INED editor described in a paper presented at SANS II, April
1993. The PostScript version of the paper can be found in the file
ined.ps.gz on ftp.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de in the directory /pub/local/papers.

The source of tkined is also available from ftp.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de and
can be found in the directory /pub/local/tkined. The file is called
tkined-*.tar.gz.  To install tkined, you need Tk Version 4.0 and
Tcl version 7.4. First unpack the tar archive:

  > gzip -d tkined-*.tar.gz
  > tar xvf tkined-*.tar

Now you have to compile tkined. Take a look at Makefile.in for
some configuration options. If everything looks fine, just type

  > ./configure

There are some options to configure to help you in case configure
can not find the Tcl or Tk library because it is installed in a non
standard setup:

	--with-tcl-include=<path>
	--with-tcl-library=<path>
	--with-tk-include=<path>
	--with-tk-library=<path>

The default compiler is cc. You can force the use of gcc by using:

	--with-gcc

For tkined hackers, there is a special option --with-auto-load which
will create a tkined binary that loads the Tcl part during startup.
This makes edit debug cycles much smaller, but I don't recommend it
for `production' versions.

Once configure has set up the Makefile, you can compile tkined:

  > make

If everything is well, copy the scripts and the bitmap files to the
directories specified in the Makefile.

  > make install

The file tkined.defaults contains a sample configuration. You may want
to merge it with your personal tkined.defaults file. Your personal
tkined.defaults file is searched in the directory ~/.tkined.  Consult
the man page for more details.

There is a sample tkined file called sample.tki. You can load it using
the open command of the file menu or by adding its name as a command 
line argument to tkined.

If you have problems or if you have made any changes to run tkined on
a new hardware platform, please contact us. This will make sure that
future versions will compile out of the box. You might want to join
the tkined mailing list which should serve as a place for the
discussion of tkined related themes. Bug fixes and updates will be
announced on this list. Send requests to:

	tkined-request@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de

Note that requests are handled by a majordomo server. (You can send
messages to majordomo@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de for further information about
the tkined list and what you can do with majordomo.) Once subscribed,
you can send messages to the list address, which is:

	tkined@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de

You might also consider to get scotty, a Tcl interpreter that has
extensions to set up tcp connections, to submit ping packets, to
query various RPC services and to talk to SNMP agents. Scotty turns 
tkined into a small but nice network management station. Scotty is 
available from ftp.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de in /pub/local/tkined.

You will find a paper presented at LISA VII (November 1993) describing 
scotty's network discovering script on ftp.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de in the file
/pub/local/papers/discover.ps.gz. There is an additional paper describing 
our computer network configuration database called bones (bones.ps.gz) 
which has been presented at SANS II, April 1993

We would also like to get nice icons for all sort of machines. If you
make new icons and if you are willing to share then with us, please
drop us a note (and the icons :-).

Edmund J. Sutcliffe <ejs1@tower.york.ac.uk> told me about an archive
of sun net manager icons at zippy.Telcom.arizona.edu. These icons are
in Sun's icon format but could be easily converted to xbitmap format.
John Rouillard <rouilj@dstar.iddis.com> did the conversion and added
a few more icons. You will find them in the contrib directory on
ftp://ftp.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/pub/local/tkined.



Have fun,

Tkined started as an experiment to rewrite an already existing network
editor called ined on top of the Tk/Tcl toolkit. The InterViews version 
was written by Thomas Birke (birke@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de) and Hinnerk
Ruemenapf (rueme@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de).

Guntram Hueske (hueske@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de) turned the stripchart and
barchart Tcl code into C code that implemented two new canvas items.
Guntram also wrote an application called tkgraphs which inspired
the GRAPH object type and the diagram window.

Erik Schoenfelder (schoenfr@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de) contributed ideas that
really improved the tkined interface. He is also a very good tester.

Thanks to Brian Bartholomew (bb@math.ufl.edu) for some interesting
proposals and Henning G. Schulzrinne (hgs@research.att.com) for some
bug reports.

Many thanks to Mark Weissman (weissman@gte.com) for making his emacs 
key bindings available (see em_bind.tcl for the Copyright), although
they are not used anymore.

Dieter Rueffler <dieter@prz.tu-berlin.de> proposed to integrate
"hyperlinks" to remote tkined maps using URLs. The idea is now
implemented as reference objects.

Juergen Luksch (luksch@telenet.de) reported compilation problems on
SCO machines and provided some suggestions on how to fix them.

Detlev Habicht (habicht@ims.uni-hannover.de) provided some icons.

Stefan Petri (petri@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de) reported some tricky bugs.

Jim Madden (jmadden@ucsd.edu) send some patches to fix some bugs.

John Rouillard (rouilj@dstar.iddis.com) always sends very good bug
and wish lists to the mailing list. This usually causes a lot of
work but is always appreciated.

And also many thanks to all the bug reports and suggestions reported
to me or the tkined mailing list.
