.SH NAME
rlprd \- remote printing proxy daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrlprd\fP  [\fB-nqV\fP] [\fB-p\fPport] [\fB-t\fPtimeout] [\fB--debug\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrlprd\fP is a proxy which runs between \fBrlpr\fP clients and
traditional \fBlpd\fP servers in situations where the \fBrlpr\fP client
cannot be installed setuid root.  For a discussion on how to configure
\fBrlpr\fP please see \fBrlpr\fP(1).
.PP
\fBrlprd\fP needs to be installed setuid root \- if it cannot be run this
way, it is \fBuseless\fP.
.PP
\fBrlprd\fP works by mapping non-privileged port requests from
\fBrlpr\fP(1) clients to privileged ports so that \fBlpd\fP's will
listen to them.  Eliminating the "security" gained by having
privileged ports is a non-issue, since the internet is no longer just
unix, and unix is the only OS that has the privileged port concept.
