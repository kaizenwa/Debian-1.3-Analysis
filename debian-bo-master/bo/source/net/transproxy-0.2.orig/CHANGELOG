version 0.2
	**	Parse the request headers looking for a "Host:" header to try
		and find the real host name the request was being sent to.
		When this works out it means no DNS lookups at all. More work
		needs to be done on reliably searching the headers.

	**	Use setuid/setgid instead of setreuid/setregid so that the
		saved uid and gid also get set.

	**	I found that if a set the SIGCLD singal to SIG_IGN then I
		don't have to worry about children or zombies!

Version 0.1
	**	Initial version.
