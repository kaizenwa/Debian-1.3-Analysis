 * After being processed by "configure", this file is placed in the
 * object directory.  This is done because a different configure.h is
 * needed for each target architecture; the object directory seems (to me)
 * like the natural place to keep object-dependant files, but it does
 * tend to look a little weird to have a .h mixed in with the .o's.
