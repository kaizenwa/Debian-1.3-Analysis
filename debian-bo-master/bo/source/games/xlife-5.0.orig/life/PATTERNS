Some patterns to check out:

breeder:	the full blown breeder pattern which constructs
		an infinite number of glider guns as it
		moves to the right in the universe. This
		is *big*.

cmu:		well, if you didn't know already, CMU's official logo
		is a 14 degree square.  Run this to see *why* it is.
		Just kidding ... really >:-)

shuttletrail:	defines a period-20 rake flotilla that leaves a 
		trail of shuttles at 10 cell intervals.

ex:		contains the example patterns referred to in the file
		pattern_editing.

p[1-9][1-9]*:	oscillators of period n

centinial:	*s*entinal (i kin spill weyl :-)

longsnake:	collapsing gliders

gourmet:	interesting new clock pattern

randomgun:	look carefully, then beat your head against
		the wall to clear your brain.

alu:		even worse
counter:	my head hurts ...
blockpusher*:	push da weetle block down the screen ...
slowship*:	*large* spaceships

plus lots and lots of nifty patterns which have been snarfed from all over the
place. You should see somewhere in there just about every interesting little
creature you ever heard of.  If you come up with any more good patterns
(hopefully smaller than the breeder :-), please send them over to us!
