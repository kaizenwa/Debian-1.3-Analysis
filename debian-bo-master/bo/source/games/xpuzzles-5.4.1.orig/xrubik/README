  X-BASED RUBIK'S CUBE(tm)
  ==================== Magic cube X widgets, V5.4


  It has been tested on the following platforms:


  HP 3xx & 700    HP-UX 9.0x  X11R5
  Sun4, SPARC    SunOS 4.1.3  X11R4
  Sun4, SPARC    SunOS 5.4  X11R5
  PC, 486      Linux 1.0.9  X11R5(*)
  PC, 486      Linux 1.2.8  X11R6(**)

    * Keypad may not work, since various keycodes may not be defined
      by default.  Check that "KP_1 - KP_9, Home, Up, Prior, Left,
      Begin, Right, End, Down, Next" are defined towards the end of
      /usr/lib/X11/etc/xmodmap.std .  If not defined
      cp /usr/lib/X11/etc/xmodmap.std /usr/lib/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap
      and then motify this or create your own at ${HOME}/.Xmodmap .
      You should just have to uncomment them (get rid of some '!').
      This should be done before X is started.  Also it may work better
      with the Num-Lock on.

  The most updated source could be found on ftp.x.org under
  /contrib/games/puzzles .  If you have to do any editing to get
  this to work, please mail me the changes (see bottom of file).

HOW TO BUILD?

  An ANSI C compiler is required for build.

  To build, it should be easy.  There are 3 choices.

    configure:
      Relatively new so there is a good possiblity that it is not set up
      correctly on your system.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE
      in Makefile.in .

      configure ; make

    imake:
      Sometimes this is not setup correctly by the distributer ... i.e. not
      my fault.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in Imakefile .
      If you have Motif you may want to do this quick edit in the Imakefile:
        Uncomment line "#define XpmLibrary".

      xmkmf ; make

    make.com (VMS users only):
      You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in make.com .

      @make

  Then just run "xrubik" (or "xmrubik" if you have Motif).
  If you do a "make install" "SCOREFILE" and "DATAFILE" must be
  set correctly.

  You should have Rubik.ad (or Stupid.ad) copied to $(HOME)/Rubik or 
  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Rubik to run, especially if the background
  is similar to one of the faces. Edit this file for your preferences.
  You might want to move xrubik into /usr/bin/X11 (or wherever your
  X binaries are).
  You might also want to move xrubik.man to /usr/man/man6/xrubik.6

  Try resizing the cube. Notice the puzzle resizes to take advantage
  of the "room" available.

  If you were looking for a auto-solver, sorry. One of the problems in
  auto-solvers the generally don't work for different number of cuts.
  If you know of one let me know. There is a real neat 3x3x3 cube called
  "magiccube" with a better 3-D look, a auto-solver, and Motif. Use
  "archie" to find "magiccube" at the site nearest you.

  Also a tesseract (4D cube) would be nice. (I heard a 3^N cube has been
  built in software and solved!)

  Personally, I have solved 1-3 using this program, 2-5 using the
  physical cubes, and 6 to my knowledge have never been done (be the
  first on your block).

  Refer to the man page for detailed command line options.

  If you want further information on puzzles, I'll be glad :-) to send
  it to you.

FOUND A BUG?

  Send bugs reports and fixes to the author. For bugs, please include
  as much information as to their location as possible, since I may not
  have the resources to duplicate the them.

  [Apr 08, 96]  V5.3: Minor changes.
  [Jan 31, 96]  V5.2: Puzzle can now moved by a more intuitive drag and
    drop approach.  Pieces will invert, when selected.
    Now using dynamic allocation, so there is no maximum size.
  [Dec 15, 95]  V5.1: Minor updates, RNG for 32/64 bit, border color
    to make faces look more realistic.
  [Oct 06, 95]  V5.0: Xt/Motif, your choice.
  [May 16, 95]  V4.10: Warnings removed from Sun's cc and lint and now
    include a random number generator.
  [Mar 13, 95]  V4.9: Removed lint warnings and added a VMS make.com .
  [Nov 11, 94]  V4.8: Conservative guess for random number generator.
  [Oct 11, 94]  V4.7: Bug fix for save with undos.
  [Sep 28, 94]  V4.6: Now allows undos, saves, and recalls.
  [Aug 08, 94]  V4.5: Auto-solves from practice mode.
  [Jun 23, 94]  V4.4: Auto-solves up to 3x3x3 courtesy of
    Michael B. Martin <martinm@sps1.phys.vt.edu>.
  [Jun 15, 94]  V4.3: Mistakenly used a Boolean variable in an array.
  [Jun 02, 94]  V4.2: Minor changes, R6.
  [May 31, 94]  V4.1: Minor changes, record sometimes displayed "32767"
    instead of "NONE".
  [May 10, 94]  V4.0: Xt version.
    I got some good ideas from oclock.
  [May 20, 93]  V3.0: Motif version.
    I got some good ideas from Douglas A. Young's
    book: "The X Window System Programming and Applications
    with Xt OSF/Motif Edition", particularly his dial widget.
    I got some good ideas on presentation from Q. Zhao's
    tetris.
  [Jan 16, 92]  V2.0: XView version.
  [Jan 16, 91]  V1.0: SunView version.
