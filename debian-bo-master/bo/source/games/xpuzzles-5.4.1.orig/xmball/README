  X-BASED MASTERBALL(tm)
  ================== Masterball X widget, V5.4


  It has been tested on the following platforms:

    Sun4 SPARC   SunOS 5.5.1  X11R5,X11R6
    DEC  VAX     VMS6.1       X11R5
    DEC  ALPHA   VMS6.1       X11R5
    HP   HPPA1.1 HP-UX 9.01   X11R5
    PC   486     Linux 1.2.13 X11R6(*)

    * Keypad may not work, since various keycodes may not be defined
      by default.  Check that "KP_1 - KP_9, Home, Up, Prior, Left,
      Begin, Right, End, Down, Next" are defined towards the end of
      /usr/lib/X11/etc/xmodmap.std .  If not defined
      cp /usr/lib/X11/etc/xmodmap.std /usr/lib/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap
      and then motify this or create your own at ${HOME}/.Xmodmap .
      You should just have to uncomment them (get rid of some '!').
      This should be done before X is started.  Also it may work better
      with the Num-Lock on.

  The most updated source could be found on ftp.x.org under
  /contrib/games/puzzles .  If you have to do any editing to get
  this to work, please mail me the changes (see bottom of file).

HOW TO BUILD?

  An ANSI C compiler is required for build.

  To build, it should be easy.  There are 3 choices.

    configure:
      Relatively new so there is a good possiblity that it is not set up
      correctly on your system.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE
      in Makefile.in .

      configure ; make

    imake:
      Sometimes this is not setup correctly by the distributer ... i.e. not
      my fault.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in Imakefile .
      If you have Motif you may want to do this quick edit in the Imakefile:
        Uncomment line "#define XpmLibrary".

      xmkmf ; make

    make.com (VMS users only):
      You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in make.com .

      @make

  Then just run "xmball" (or "xmmball" if you have Motif).
  If you do a "make install" "SCOREFILE" and "DATAFILE" must be
  set correctly.

  You should have Mball.ad copied to $(HOME)/Mball or 
  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Mball to run, especially if the background
  is similar to one of the wedges. Edit this file for your preferences.
  You might want to move xmball into /usr/bin/X11 (or wherever your
  X binaries are).
  You might also want to move xmball.man to /usr/man/man6/xmball.6

  The control feature allows you to move the whole masterball at
  once without being entered as a move.  Hold down the control key
  while using the left mouse button or the keypad.

  One has to orient the wedges in orient mode, besides getting all the
  wedges to be the same color. To do this one has to get the wedges
  with the numbers on one side and in order (clockwise).  This will add
  complexity, so there are 2 sets of records.

  Try resizing the masterball. Notice the puzzle resizes to take
  advantage of the "room" available.

  The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
    xmball.{2|4|6|8}: <int> @ (<Number of moves>/\
      {<Record number of moves>|NEVER|PRACTICE}) - <Comment>
      {2|4|6|8}: current number of wedges.
      <int>: number of sectors per wedge.
      {<Record...}: puzzle is either in practice mode or record mode
        In record mode, if there is no record of the current puzzle, it
        displays "NEVER".

  If you were looking for a auto-solver, sorry. One of the problems in
  auto-solvers the generally don't work for different number of cuts.
  If you know of one let me know.

  I know the look is not exactly right.  For simplicity, I did not take
  into account spherical placement of the latitude cuts.

  Refer to the man page for detailed command line options.

  If you want further information on puzzles, I'll be glad :-) to send
  it to you.

FOUND A BUG?

  Send bugs reports and fixes to the author. For bugs, please include
  as much information as to their location as possible, since I may not
  have the resources to duplicate the them.

HISTORY

  [Jan 01, 97]  V5.4: Username, concurrency check, configure, bug fixes in
    get, write, and undo, man page updates.
  [Apr 08, 96]  V5.3: Minor changes.
  [Jan 31, 96]  V5.2: Puzzle can be moved by a more intuitive drag and
    drop approach.  Sectors will invert, when selected.
    Now using dynamic allocation, so there is no maximum
    number of rings.  The maximum number of wedges though
    is still fixed at 8.
  [Dec 15, 95]  V5.1: Minor updates, RNG for 32/64 bit. Better sector
    drawing algorithm.  I did not figure out the border
    lines on the sectors, next time...
  [Oct 02, 95]  V5.0: Xt/Motif, your choice.
  [May 16, 95]  V4.10: Warnings removed from Sun's cc and lint and now
                include a random number generator.
  [Mar 13, 95]  V1.4: Removed lint warnings and added a VMS make.com .
  [Nov 11, 94]  V1.3: Conservative guess for random number generator.
  [Nov 07, 94]  V1.2: Now allows undos, saves, and recalls.
  [Sep 19, 94]  V1.1: Minor changes.
  [Sep 15, 94]  V1.0: Xt version.
