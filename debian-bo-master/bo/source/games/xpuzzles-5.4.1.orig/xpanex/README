  The most updated source could be found on ftp.x.org under
  /contrib/games/puzzles .  If you have to do any editing to get
  this to work, please mail me the changes (see bottom of file).

HOW TO BUILD?

  An ANSI C compiler is required for build.

  To build, it should be easy.  There are 3 choices.

    configure:
      Relatively new so there is a good possiblity that it is not set up
      correctly on your system.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE
      in Makefile.in .
 
      configure ; make

    imake:
      Sometimes this is not setup correctly by the distributer ... i.e. not
      my fault.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in Imakefile .
      If you have Motif you may want to do this quick edit in the Imakefile:
        Uncomment line "#define XpmLibrary".

      xmkmf ; make

    make.com (VMS users only):
      You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in make.com .

      @make
      
  Then just run "xpanex" (or "xmpanex" if you have Motif).
  If you do a "make install" "SCOREFILE" and "DATAFILE" must be
  set correctly.

  You should have Panex.ad copied to $(HOME)/Panex or 
  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Panex to run, especially if the background
  is similar to the tiles. Edit this file for your preferences.  For
  monochrome, the tile color needs to be brighter.  You might want to
  move xpanex into /usr/bin/X11 (or wherever your X binaries are).
  You might also want to move xpanex.man to /usr/man/man1/xpanex.6

  Try resizing Panex.  Notice the puzzle resizes to take advantage of
  the "room" available.

  Keep in mind that Panex is a widget that can be simply stuck in
  other X programs. (If you find a use for this, let me know).

  Refer to the man page for detailed command line options and instructions
  on how to operate.

  If you want further information on puzzles, I'll be glad :-) to send
  it to you.

FOUND A BUG?

  Send bugs reports and fixes to the author. For bugs, please include
  as much information as to their location as possible, since I may not
  be able to duplicate the problems with my limited resources.
