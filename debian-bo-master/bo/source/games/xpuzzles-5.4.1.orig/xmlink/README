  X-BASED MISSING LINK(tm)
  ==================== Missing Link X widget, V5.4


  It has been tested on the following platforms:

    Sun4 SPARC   SunOS 5.5.1  X11R5,X11R6
    DEC  VAX     VMS6.1       X11R5
    DEC  ALPHA   VMS6.1       X11R5
    HP   HPPA1.1 HP-UX 9.01   X11R5
    PC   486     Linux 1.2.13 X11R6(*)

    * Keypad may not work, since various keycodes may not be defined
      by default.  Check that "KP_1 - KP_9, Home, Up, Prior, Left,
      Begin, Right, End, Down, Next" are defined towards the end of
      /usr/lib/X11/etc/xmodmap.std .  If not defined
      cp /usr/lib/X11/etc/xmodmap.std /usr/lib/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap
      and then motify this or create your own at ${HOME}/.Xmodmap .
      You should just have to uncomment them (get rid of some '!').
      This should be done before X is started.  Also it may work better
      with the Num-Lock on.

  The most updated source could be found on ftp.x.org under
  /contrib/games/puzzles .  If you have to do any editing to get
  this to work, please mail me the changes (see bottom of file).

HOW TO BUILD?

  An ANSI C compiler is required for build.

  To build, it should be easy.  There are 3 choices.

    configure:
      Relatively new so there is a good possiblity that it is not set up
      correctly on your system.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE
      in Makefile.in .

      configure ; make

    imake:
      Sometimes this is not setup correctly by the distributer ... i.e. not
      my fault.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in Imakefile .
      If you have Motif you may want to do this quick edit in the Imakefile:
        Uncomment line "#define XpmLibrary".

      xmkmf ; make

    make.com (VMS users only):
      You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in make.com .

      @make

  Then just run "xmlink" (or "xmmlink" if you have Motif).
  If you do a "make install" "SCOREFILE" and "DATAFILE" must be
  set correctly.

  You should have Mlink.ad copied to $(HOME)/Mlink or 
  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Mlink to run, especially if the background
  is similar to one of the faces. Edit this file for your preferences.
  You might want to move xmlink into /usr/bin/X11 (or wherever your
  X binaries are).
  You might also want to move xmlink.man to /usr/man/man6/xmlink.6

  Monochrome users may have to run it with -tile Black or -tile White.
  or with -fg White or -fg Black.  Whatever works for you.

  I chose to display the puzzle horizontally because if I ever decide
  to implement the auto-solver, it will be easier because the IDEAL
  solution book shows it that way.
 
  Keep in mind that Mlink is a widget that can be simply stuck in
  other X programs. (If you find a use for this, let me know).

  Refer to the man page for detailed command line options.

  If you want further information on puzzles, I'll be glad :-) to send
  it to you.

FOUND A BUG?

  Send bugs reports and fixes to the author. For bugs, please include
  as much information as to their location as possible, since I may not
  have the resources to duplicate the them.

HISTORY

  [Jan 01, 97]  V5.4: Username, concurrency check, configure, man page
    updates.
  [Aug 01, 96]  V5.3.2: Fixed for default for monochrome.
  [Apr 08, 96]  V5.3: Minor changes.  Links are drawn now with the same
    orientation as the original.
  [Jan 31, 96]  V5.2: Now uses an intuitive drag and drop approach for
    rotating tiles.  Tiles will invert, when selected.
    Now using dynamic allocation, so there is no maximum size.
  [Dec 15, 95]  V5.1: Minor updates, RNG for 32/64 bit.  Better sector
    drawing algorithm.  Border color to make faces look more
    realistic.
  [Oct 01, 95]  V5.0: Xt/Motif, your choice.
  [May 16, 95] V4.10: Warnings removed from Sun's cc and lint and now
    include a random number generator.  Bug fixed where
    xmlink moved correctly but was hard to turn.
  [Mar 13, 95]  V1.4: Removed lint warnings and added a VMS make.com .
  [Nov 11, 94]  V1.3: Conservative guess for random number generator.
  [Nov 07, 94]  V1.2: Now allows undos, saves, and recalls.
  [Sep 19, 94]  V1.1: Initialize bug removed.
  [Aug 30, 94]  V1.0: Xt version.
