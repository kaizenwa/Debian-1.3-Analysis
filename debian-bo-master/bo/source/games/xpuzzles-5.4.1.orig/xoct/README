  X-BASED OCTAHEDRON
  ================== Octahedron X widget, V5.4


  It has been tested on the following platforms:

    Sun4 SPARC   SunOS 5.5.1  X11R5,X11R6
    DEC  VAX     VMS6.1       X11R5
    DEC  ALPHA   VMS6.1       X11R5
    HP   HPPA1.1 HP-UX 9.01   X11R5
    PC   486     Linux 1.2.13 X11R6(*)

    * Keypad may not work, since various keycodes may not be defined
      by default.  Check that "KP_1 - KP_9, Home, Up, Prior, Left,
      Begin, Right, End, Down, Next" are defined towards the end of
      /usr/lib/X11/etc/xmodmap.std .  If not defined
      cp /usr/lib/X11/etc/xmodmap.std /usr/lib/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap
      and then motify this or create your own at ${HOME}/.Xmodmap .
      You should just have to uncomment them (get rid of some '!').
      This should be done before X is started.

  The most updated source could be found on ftp.x.org under
  /contrib/games/puzzles .  If you have to do any editing to get
  this to work, please mail me the changes (see bottom of file).

HOW TO BUILD?

  An ANSI C compiler is required for build.

  To build, it should be easy.  There are 3 choices.

    configure:
      Relatively new so there is a good possiblity that it is not set up
      correctly on your system.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE
      in Makefile.in .

      configure ; make

    imake:
      Sometimes this is not setup correctly by the distributer ... i.e. not
      my fault.  You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in Imakefile .
      If you have Motif you may want to do this quick edit in the Imakefile:
        Uncomment line "#define XpmLibrary".

      xmkmf ; make

    make.com (VMS users only):
      You may want to set SCOREFILE and DATAFILE in make.com .

      @make

  Then just run "xoct" (or "xmoct" if you have Motif).
  If you do a "make install" "SCOREFILE" and "DATAFILE" must be
  set correctly.

  You should have Oct.ad copied to $(HOME)/Oct or 
  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Oct to run, especially if the background
  is similar to one of the faces. Edit this file for your preferences.
  You might want to move xoct into /usr/bin/X11 (or wherever your
  X binaries are).
  You might also want to move xoct.man to /usr/man/man6/xoct.6

  Try resizing the octahedron. Notice the puzzle resizes to take
  advantage of the "room" available.

  If you were looking for a auto-solver, sorry. One of the problems in
  auto-solvers the generally don't work for different number of cuts.
  If you know of one let me know.

  Personally, I have solved 1-2 in  "Period 3" mode, 1-3 in the
  "Period 4" mode, 1 in the "Both" mode, and "Sticky" I have not
  solved it in any mode.

  Refer to the man page for detailed command line options.

  If you want further information on puzzles, I'll be glad :-) to send
  it to you.

FOUND A BUG?

  Send bugs reports and fixes to the author. For bugs, please include
  as much information as to their location as possible, since I may not
  have the resources to duplicate the them.

HISTORY

  [Jan 01, 97]  V5.4: Username, concurrency check, configure, man page
    updates.
  [Apr 08, 96]  V5.3: Minor changes.
  [Jan 31, 96]  V5.2: Puzzle can now moved by a more intuitive drag and
    drop approach.  Pieces will invert, when selected.
    Now using dynamic allocation, so there is no maximum size.
  [Dec 15, 95]  V5.1: Minor updates, RNG for 32/64 bit, border color
    to make faces look more realistic.
  [Oct 04, 95]  V5.0: Xt/Motif, your choice.
  [Jun 06, 95]  V4.10.1: Warning error fixed.
  [May 16, 95]  V4.10: Warnings removed from Sun's cc and lint and now
    include a random number generator.  More freedom in
    movement using control+shift.
  [Mar 13, 95]  V4.4: Removed lint warnings and added a VMS make.com .
  [Oct 11, 94]  V4.3: Conservative guess for random number generator.
  [Oct 07, 94]  V4.2: Now allows undos, saves, and recalls.
  [Jun 28, 94]  V4.1: Can accommodate a auto-solver.
  [Jun 05, 94]  V4.0: Xt version.
    I got some good ideas from oclock.
  [Apr 01, 93]  V3.0: Motif version.
    I got some good ideas from Douglas A. Young's
    book: "The X Window System Programming and Applications
    with Xt OSF/Motif Edition", particularly his dial widget.
    I got some good ideas on presentation from Q. Zhao's
    tetris.
  [Feb 01, 92]  V2.0: XView version.
  [Jun 10, 91]  V1.0: SunView version.
