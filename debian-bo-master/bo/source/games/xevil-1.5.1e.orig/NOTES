cloak done.(machines can't see)

chainsaws,lancers,grenades thru walls

cursor in window

doors

eggs and huggers "Try the HIVE scenario.  Heh, heh, heh."

dopplegangers less annoying, don't collide, computers don't use

walkers(lasers)

fixed attack_hook for BuiltIn

default to 0 machines instead of 3

aliens can't hurt hug victims

Machines can't see you when cloaked.

corpses don't collide

can chainsaw or transmogify to get away from huggers

*** TO DO
Altar of Sin come back every couple of levels.

!!!!! Sticky corners messed up on Sun5 (on everything?)

amazons

structure notify mask

accessible_rect

make doors accessible

WM_DELETE protocol

need some sort of wimpy mode

redraw on new level messed up?

protection destroyed on new level.

pause at game start.

hero caught on wall (especially jumping and getting stuck)

corpses fall slowly and keep moving
could make dead creatures continuously set vel to zero

If knocked out of world, may get stuck.

scoping of for loops (on sun5 sparc) and linux





*** DONE
stats(done)
transmog(done)
enemy_ph(done)
human_ph(done)
doppel(done)
human_name parsing(done)
game objects(done)
register everything(done)

decmips weapon string wrong

get_weapon_string() was not overridden for Hero, Ninja, and ChopperBoy

kill was_ever_hugged()

cloak auto-use?? (have to not work for machines)

make doppel auto-use for humans only

change walkers, weaker weapon 40

alien intel attacks huggers, hugger attack alien, hugger and non-bio

BuiltIn doesn't show a weapon type.

Locator::draw_area trivial reject

huggers and eggs

at at

chopper-boy knocked far out of world (warning messages) 

stars ninja better with them

O_LEMMINGS_NEED must be fixed for stupid compilers

slave reset on new level

change register_machines to _enemies and _bystanders

add highest level to statistics at end

say type of level

locator.cc:542: failed assertion `list[n].physical == p'
Illegal instruction

title screen moves...bad(fixed???)

(fixed) area.cc:103: failed assertion `nitems < AR_WSQUARES_MAX'
Illegal instruction

life span and other stats.

clears level message on Ui when game over

capture_the_flag

guarantee get to exit

(fixed?)LEVELS game style
(fixed?)first level random (new_level() call) (starts out w/ wrong message)

clean up rest of stuff (make physicalIter) set_quiet_death first, including 
the exit.

too many weapons

fix duel and levels (all have levels of some sort, 2 duels perhaps)

enforcer kill self

frog killed doesn't give points(set_quiet_death, killer not transferred).
(put killerId in intel, not Physical... change Creature)

frog a frog
	FrogShell goes through a Frog

quiet death (noCorpse for Creature, User drops weapons, transmogifier)
	Something of a hack.  User still drops all weapons/items.

transmogifier (item, become other, make intel use when wounded.)

check medkits for non-users.

(done)statistics at end

(done)hero regenerate health

(fixed)unlimited lives in duel.  reset levels in duel

(fixed) Frog makes its physical follow it

(fixed?)
Assertion failed: n > 0, file actual.C, line 288
Abort (core dumped)

(fixed) seg fault with -keys on multi displays!!!!

(fixed) show controls doesn't do a very good job

(fixed) add hardts@media to actual code (file headers already done)

(done)fix man pages

easier to tell weapon... flashes on screen

vIndexNum should becom vIndexNum and vIndexMax
Ui::init_x

copy of Xvars inside Panel

timer on demos (frog demo)

check shield dies with owner.  Put protection in Physical or shadow it 
properly.
n-shield with swapper and frog gun.  teach intel to use it.
other shields. (done)

locator.cc OLgridEntry::remove crashes because no prev.
also OLgridEntry::get_area  

reorder so that die done by locator and between act and update phases.

// When unregistering intels in the Ui
tooui.cc:648: failed assertion `!intels[n]->alive()'
IOT trap (core dumped)

intel still attack even if running away.

after death allow scrolling around

(only run at enemy if has
weapon or is fighter--fixes frog also) 

bomb does not always hit. (at close range??) (haven't noticed problem)

fix World::empty so posters don't overlap

weapon change (don't keep) 

fire should last longer and still do same total damage Fire::DAMAGE
constatnts should be in fire.bitmaps

Add quanta to the Ui.

show more at level change

machines shouldn't wait for weapon regenerate

machines don't use flamers at long range

don't get kills for using flame-thrower

Creature::act assertion fails...corpse with intel
swap with corpse??  have moving corpse -- have dead with non-NULL intel
Assertion failed: !get_intel(), file physical.cc, line 1317
world->open_offset failure
	virtual function fuckup

panic avoid should stop velocity.

game style (levels and death)

use select for wasting time.

machines with chainsaws

Physical::set_mapped_next should call some update next.  Perhaps items being
stranded.  User::die calls Item::dropped which calls set_mapped_next.
	allow setting of next variables in update phase for all except 
yourself.

ammo stuff--pick up weapon, take it's ammo

slow objects-speed up clock

enemies can't off ladder around edge of ledge 
	fixed by having updowns

go off ladder--keep climbing

frog dies -> kill person, leave person's corpse

give warning if can't allocate color

Physical::update: dieCalled unnecessary??
	Use health and healthNext to make sure die() only called once.

make all classes have an enumerated id

bouncing on things
	have Area::avoid_no_up

crash when take over a machine, something to do with string compares
	got rid of all string compares with ClassId

bombs gone after death

shells kill each other

seg fault (???)

jump against edge of walls(keep moving a bit for walking only)

shells don't push
things levitating to ceiling
	only one of 2 objects that collide avoids the other

soul swappers should only fire once.

flashing shit
lancers disappear. 
	new drawing method: locator erases old stuff

cleanup world stuff

Can only add to locator in update phase or on clock.  Does not recognize new
objects until the beginning of the next clock cycle.

DISABLED sleeping 5/10/94
	things don't die until awakened(put something into corporeal attack)
	timer problems

put event check on clock only.  find best quanta.

things keep moving after death.

Walking::act, etc  set vel_next to remove x or y component anytime you are
touching

colors of statuses reflect humans color

no more stationary

lance and swap shell black on B&W display

make lancer fire at tilted angles
	fucked, perhaps cant get offset.

flush messages on reset, clear statuses

add command line options to set num players and machines

fighting by Size::get_dir instead of Area::dir_to

Number indicating players alive

firing gun puts shell ahead constant dist 

take over enforcer.  says weapon and item is none.

enemy jumping off ladders
	added ladderJump timer.

finish implementing use of guns.  put in timer for firing.

change quit key to 'b'

(?) change ui so that events are seen by arenas first, then statuses, etc.

make next item available when item is dropped

locator has listMax

don't redraw world twice on new game start.
	reset after ui clock in Game::clock

dead bodies keep moving. (maybe because of items) ??
	drop items off to side.	

grounded shouldn't start at CO_center -> don't need set_stance()

make sure drops things off to side(FAILED)
moving::set_raw_pos_next screwed.  perhaps should offset area here.
order of this call and moving::act seems to matter.

draws wrong when drop item if holding more than one item
	incremented n wrong in end of User::act

check doesn't draw when out of world.

check that no keys set on machine's viewport (?)

???? Assertion failed: locator->lookup(current,items[itemCurrent]) == OL_NO_SIG, 
file physical.cc, line 1085 

tap key for fighter attack
	weapon dir memory in ui now.

message that __ corpse takes damage

bug because items that are held still draw. 

explosion drawing is fucked

dangling references from user

make ui only redraw on clock

-keys on command line

in Locator::draw checking that area overlaps twice.

mark_world screwed??

improve world->open
items should follow user. (So bomb explodes correctly.)
user checks list for dead, etc.

(??)
	locator.cc:126: failed assertion `nitems < OL_NEARBY_MAX'
	caught in infinite loop
	grid not clean

still have blocked off rooms

(??)knocked out of locator grid--can be pushed off world

(??)Assertion failed: nitems < AR_WSQUARES_MAX, file area.cc, line 96

die on ladder -> get stuck

now if knocked outside world you die

change object goes to active object first.

Assertion failed: shape == AR_RECT, file area.cc, line 182

corpses can die

only one of each weapon



*** INFO
scopes not all right(?? supposed to be?)

keep act and update separate because of chainsaw.
act() phase for synchronized interactions.  Unsynchronized interactions allowed
in update() phase.

can now put act() and update() calls to parent anywhere in child procedure.
Child is responsible for correct placement. (User::act)

turning key repeat off is not worth it.(screws other applications.)

could compute offsets automatically.

exception handling not implemented

static class members that are classes don't work

nested scopes don't work with CC, they do with g++

bitmaps:  all maps with just different letters are same size.  First should
          be biggest in actuality.

*** IDEAS
theives

leaches, slime from ceiling

doors

teleporters

turrets

blob... health == mass

hold down keys...don't tap

heros jump on ledges, maybe higher jump

swords, axes, big steel fists

shape-changers (items) or creatures that can't use weapons or items

predator

User orders weapons

full screen

better explosions

could improve X resources and -keys for multiple displays

doors(open when close) 

different levels (capture the flag, bonus level(kill frogs in timer))

massive death

optimize area, middle and smaller.

bonus for killing all on bonus level

chinese dragon 

fire bombs/grenades/other grenades

order weapons, machines choose smartly

temporary lava pits

aliens spray acid

chopper boy blades

drugs(dope)

alien eggs

lawyers

dogs

really should have list for dontCollide (for slaves)

drugs(dope)

tapping keys(chopper-boy brakes, hold move and use weapon, real careful movement) DISABLED

CHANGES VS WINDOWS VERSION
lasers do 50 damage.

BuiltIn wrong string displayed.

fireDemon not bio creature to avoid being hugged (and acquiring hug immunity)
