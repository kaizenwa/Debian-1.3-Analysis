This is the README for LinCity Version 1.03 - development continues.

WHAT IS LinCity?
================

LinCity is an SVGALIB and X based city/country simulation game for Linux.
(Solaris 2.5, FreeBSD, HP_UX, AIX and IRIX are ALPHA at this time, but have
been reported to work - sometimes needing a tweak to the Makefile[s].)

You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house,
provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable
economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for
broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource
starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources available in any
one place, this is not a game that you can leave for long periods of time.

The code is (sort of) BETA; it is still under development. However few
problems have been reported and the game is more or less complete. It would
be nice if you could send me an e-mail (ijp@floot.demon.co.uk) saying
'good', 'bad', etc., or any bug reports or ideas. Also, for those who are
really keen, I have set up a mailing list. To subscribe, send mail to

      majordomo@floot.demon.co.uk   with

      subscribe lincity     in the body of your mail.


As game is still under development, you will notice that some of the
graphics are better than others, and that some are not animated yet. There
are some new graphics, and ones that are still there from the early days.

Major changes since 1.00
========================

1.03
****

- Endian checking added. Big endian machines couldn't load good-times etc.
- (Actually in 1.02) Multi-transport added. Activated by shift+leftclick.
  This is for X only. (SVGALib players can use the keyboard to quickly draw
  a long bit of transport.)

1.02
****

- Another screen scrolling bug fixed. Thanks to Erik Schoenfelder.
- Man page by Erik Schoenfelder. It feels good to go 'man lincity' :)
- sbut size changed to 32 (was 34).
- Various small fixes to make the compile '-Wall' clean... well nearly.
- Sparc (and some other CPUs perhaps) bug fixed. Misalignment of 32 bit
  data at 16 boundary. (Most CPUs are happy with this.)

1.01
****

- MAJOR BUG FIX. The bug that sometimes corrupted the the odd square,
  causing a SEG fault (among other things) has been FIXED. It's been there
  since the very beginning - 18 months or so. :(  Thanks to Kay Hamacher for
  that (insignificant seeming) observation, that put me on the right track.
- Pixel doubling added for X. ( xlincity -d ) Makes it 1280x960 - bigger,
  but slower.
- Mini screen 'power cover' button added.


REQUIREMENTS:   *  A graphics card supported by svgalib or X11.
============
                *  svgalib 1.2.9 (or greater), some earlier versions are
                               broken (eg compressed fonts)
                        [  1.2.9 and 1.2.10 are now available in 
                    disabuse.demon.co.uk:/pub/unix/linux/libs/svga ]

         OR	 X11.
         ^^
                *  An ELF install, or...
                 ... if you are using a.out libraries you will have to compile
                               it for yourself (make clean, make install).

                *  You probably need at least a 486DX2-66. (Even better
                   for the X version I suspect.)

                *  Other things? That's what you're there to find out :)



INSTALLATION:
============

To install LinCity, (as root) untar the file lincity103-src.tgz 

     tar -xzvf lincity103-src.tgz

This will unpack the game into the directory ./lincity103 .

You now want to compile the source, go into the direcrory ./lincity103

      cd lincity103
      make lincity      (or xlincity)
      make install


For more instructions on compiling/installing, look at thee file
README.INSTALL   (Typing  make  on its own will also give you some help.)

If you are non-linux, please read the README for your platform. Do not try
to compile using the Imakefile or the (platform)Makefile - they will not
work - these need to be called from the top level Makefile.

If you have a version less than 0.95 installed on your system, you MUST
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                     ^^^^
remove the following symlinks with:
                rm /usr/local/bin/lin-city
		rm /usr/local/bin/xlin-city
You should also get rid of the old source tree (although this isn't strictly
necessary), with
		rm -r /usr/local/games/lin-city


RUNNING LINCITY
===============

Usually you will invoke the game with    lincity   or   xlincity

             lincity  [opts]
             xlincity [opts]

The following options apply to both.

        -w   Do some crude gamma correction to boost the red and blue.
             This makes some 'washed out' displays a bit more colourful.
             You have control of the individual values, see below.

        -R <num>
	-G <num>
	-B <num>
             These options allow you to boost the individual colours.
             <num> is a number between 0.0 and 1.0
             The default values for -w are  1.0   0.0   0.4  (ATTOW)

This option only applies to xlincity.

        -b   Do not include the extra border around the game.
        -d   Double the size of the window to 1280x960


KNOWN BUGS:
===========

Had a report of the technology indicator showing both a rise and fall,
although I have now seen this, I haven't tracked it down yet.  (This has
been here for ages. The indicator code needs a rewrite. :(  )

"This program has something for everyone. Some people want to find bugs, so
I added some."
                                                      -unknown.

HISTORY:
=======

I started writing LinCity in June 1995 as an exercise in mouse control in
SVGALIB. It quickly became a usable, then even fun, game to play. Over the
next 18 months it evolved into a challenging and stable game which, in a
number of people's opinion, is worth uploading to the net. The current
version is 1.03 . It goes on...
