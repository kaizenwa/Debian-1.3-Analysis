FAQ for LinCity.


GENERAL
*******

Q. I did a make install, but I've got no binaries.

A. If you got the source only distribution you need to compile the programs.
Use 'make' on its own, to get a list of options.


Q. I compiled and installed, but I get a 'no such file' error when I try to
run lincity.

A. Make sure the directory where the Makefile installed the binaries is on
your path (the library directory does not have to be on your path). To see
where it will be installed, type 'make' on its own. This will show you what
the current install paths are.


SVGALIB VERSION
***************

Q. All the text seems to be 'Greek'.

A. You need at least version 1.2.9 of SVGALIB.


Q. I compiled and installed, but I get a permission denied when I try to run
lincity as anyone but root.

A. The install failed to make the file lincity suid root. 
  'make install'   again making sure that you are root.


X VERSION
*********

Q. When I move the mouse in and out of the xlincity window, the colour
palette flashes between the 'normal' colours and lincity's own. It's REALLY
annoying!

A. If you can, run your X server in a mode that displays more than 256
colours. Sorry, this is not always possible and depends on your hardware. I
use a 2M pci card and 'startx -- -bpp 16' to get 64K colours. It's really
nice.

There is a 'confine pointer' button, under the select buttons, that traps
the mouse pointer in the lincity window. Press it again to release it.

HP_UX & SOLARIS
***************

Q. It doesn't do much, must be broken, blew up my monitor...


A. I have few HP and SUN testers at this time, so I would like feedback from
you if the game fails to compile/run etc. If your monitor blows up, you're
on your own... but if you then want to dispose of it... johnw :).
