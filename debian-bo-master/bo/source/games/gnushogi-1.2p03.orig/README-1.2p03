Hello,

this is GNU Shogi 1.2 patchlevel 3. There are only minor
changes of the patchlevel 2 version. Some bugs have been
removed.

For installation procedure read doc/INSTALL.

You cannot use the binary book file from previous versions,
you have to rebuild it.

You may email discovered bugs or comments to me.

Have fun,

  Matthias Mutz.
