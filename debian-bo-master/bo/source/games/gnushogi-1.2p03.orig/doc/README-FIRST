GNU Shogi is the japanese version of chess. You can find the
rules of Shogi in "shogi.rules". This file and many other
shogi related stuff can be obtained from the SHOGI-L listserver (see
"listserv.ref"). 

GNU Shogi is based on GNU Chess 4.0, i.e. the first
version of GNU Shogi has been obtained by "simply" modifying
the chess-specific parts of GNU Chess 4.0.

There are now major changes compared to GNU Chess.

I would like to thank all people who have made the
sources of GNU Chess 4.0 available.
