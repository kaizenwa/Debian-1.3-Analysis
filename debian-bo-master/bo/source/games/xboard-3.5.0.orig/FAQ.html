<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[A.1]">[A.1] What are the gnu.chess newsgroup and info-gnu-chess mailing list for?</A></H3>

The newsgroup gnu.chess and the mailing list info-gnu-chess@prep.ai.mit.edu
are for the discussion of GNU Chess, XBoard, and related free chess software.
<P>
gnu.chess and info-gnu-chess are not for general chess or computer chess
discussion.  You won't be flamed if you post such messages here, but you will
find more information in other places.  See topic <A HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A> below.
<P>
PLEASE DO NOT try to start or play chess games by posting messages to
gnu.chess.  Instead, read the rec.games.chess FAQ 
(see topic <A HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A>)
to learn about the IECG, the
IECC, and other groups that you can join to find opponents, and send one or
more of them email to join.
<P>
The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed bidirectionally; that is,
any article posted on the newsgroup is automatically forwarded to the
mailing list, and any mail sent to the list is automatically forwarded
to the newsgroup.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[A.2]">[A.2] How do I subscribe or unsubscribe?</A></H3>

The simplest way is to either choose to read gnu.chess in your newsreader, or
choose not to.
<P>
If you want to be added to or deleted from the mailing list, mail to
info-gnu-chess-request@prep.ai.mit.edu (not to the list or newsgroup itself).

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[A.3]">[A.3] Where can I get chess information and chess 
software?</A></H3>

As a shortcut to most things mentioned in this FAQ, try my Chess Web page,
<A HREF=
"http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Tim_Mann/chess.html"
>http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Tim_Mann/chess.html</A>.
<P>
For general news and information about chess, try the newsgroup hierarchy
rec.games.chess.*, especially the groups rec.games.chess.misc and
rec.games.chess.computer.  Both of the latter groups have very informative
FAQs maintained by Steve Pribut; look for them on the newsgroups or at
<A HREF=
"http://www.clark.net/pub/pribut/chess.html"
>http://www.clark.net/pub/pribut/chess.html</A>.
<P>
Like other GNU software, you can get GNU Chess and XBoard by anonymous FTP
from 
<A HREF=
"ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/"
>ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/</A>
and its many mirror sites.  Look for files
matching the patterns gnuchess-*.gz and xboard-*.gz.  The .gz suffix indicates
the files were compressed with gzip.  You can get gzip from prep.ai.mit.edu
also.  The GNU FTP sites generally 
carry Unix-compatible versions of GNU software only,
so you won't find WinBoard or AmyBoard there.
<P>
For other chess software, try the Internet Chess Library.  Use anonymous FTP
to connect to caissa.onenet.net, or go to the Web page
<A HREF=
"http://caissa.onenet.net/"
>http://caissa.onenet.net/</A>.
You can get chess software, game
collections, the FAQ file for rec.games.chess, and other chess-related
material there, in the directory pub/chess.  Sometimes new XBoard versions
arrive on this site before they make it to prep.  The FTP server can
automatically decompress files for you as you download them, useful if you
don't have gzip.  Note that caissa.onenet.net is not necessarily the same 
machine as fics.onenet.net!
<P>
You can get WinBoard from the Internet Chess Library, in directory
pub/chess/Win3.

Here is a sample anonymous ftp session.  Some of the ftp server's responses
are abbreviated, but all the commands you must type are included.

<H3><A NAME="[A.4]">[A.4] What are the current version numbers for GNU Chess, XBoard, etc.?</A></H3>

At this writing, the current version numbers are:

<UL>
<LI>GNU Chess 4.0 patchlevel 77</LI>
<LI>XBoard 3.5 patchlevel 0</LI>
<LI>WinBoard 3.4 patchlevel 1</LI>

<H3><A NAME="[A.5]">[A.5] Who is working on this project?</A></H3>

Stuart Cracraft is the GNU Chess project coordinator.  Currently Chua
Kong Sian seems to be the only person working the GNU Chess engine
itself.  Conor McCarthy is responsible for GNU Chess 4.00 for Windows.
Tim Mann maintains this FAQ and is the lead developer on XBoard and
WinBoard, but he has little time to spend on the project.  Frank
McIngvale is also working on XBoard, concentrating on Crafty support.
Evan Welsh, the author of cmail, is not actively working on it but
does fix bugs when they are reported.  No one is currently maintaining
AmyBoard.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[A.6]">[A.6] How do I report bugs, offer help, etc.?</A></H3>

Any time you want to report a possible bug in GNU Chess, XBoard, etc., we need
to know exactly what you did, and exactly what error (or other) messages you
got.  If you're using XBoard, WinBoard, or AmyBoard, run it with the -debug
flag to see all the messages it exchanges with GNU Chess or the Internet Chess
Server.

<P>If you are using Unix, run the "script" program, do whatever is necessary to
reproduce the problem, type "exit" to the shell, and mail us the resulting
typescript file.  We also need to know what hardware/operating system
combination you are using.  The command "uname -a" will usually tell you this;
include its output in your typescript.

<P>If you are using MS Windows or the Amiga, you may have to write down all the
messages with pencil and paper and type them into your mail message.  Or you
may be able to use cut-and-paste in your console window.  Either way, please
transcribe the messsages carefully.  They may seem meaningless to you, but
they are meaningful to us and essential for diagnosing problems.

<P>You should be able to contact all the members of the project by sending mail
to bug-gnu-chess@prep.ai.mit.edu.  If you don't trust this list, you can send
mail about XBoard, WinBoard, or the FAQ to mann@pa.dec.com (Tim Mann); 
mail about cmail 
to R.E.Welsh@quadstone.co.uk (Evan Welsh).  Comments that are of interest to
all users of the software should be posted to the gnu.chess newsgroup.

<H2><A NAME="[B]">[B] GNU Chess</A></H2>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[B.1]">[B.1] What is GNU Chess?</A></H3>

GNU Chess is a free chess-playing program developed as part of the GNU project
of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

<P>GNU Chess is a communal chess program.  Contributors donate their time and
effort in order to make it a stronger, better, sleeker program.  Contributions
take many forms: interfaces to high-resolution displays, opening book
treatises, speedups of the underlying algorithms, additions of extra
heuristics.  These contributions are then distributed to the large user-base
so that all may enjoy the fruits of our labor.

<P>GNU Chess is intended to run under Unix or Unix-compatible systems.  It is
written in C and should be portable to other systems.

<P>For a test drive, try WebChess, a World Wide Web interface to GNU Chess
provided by DJ Delorie.  The URL is 
<A HREF=
"http://www.delorie.com/game-room/chess/"
>http://www.delorie.com/game-room/chess/</A>.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[B.2]">[B.2] What is GNU Chess's rating?</A></H3>

It would be irresponsible to answer this question with a number, without first
explaining a few things about ratings.

<P>The ratings that are commonly given for computer chess players are less
meaningful than they may seem.  Most computer chess players (including GNU
Chess) do not play in tournaments against humans, or do so only rarely, so
they do not have official ratings from FIDE, USCF, or other chess
organizations.

<P>Some people have methods for rating chess programs approximately by giving
them a set of problems to work on and seeing how they do, or by having them
play tournaments against each other.  Any rating number produced by such
means should be taken with a grain of salt; it may be only a rough
approximation to the rating the program would achieve in over-the-board
tournament competition against humans.  The chess skills required for solving
problems or playing against other computers are not necessarily the same as
those required for play against humans.  Also, of course, tournaments among
computers can rate the computers only relative to one another, not relative to
humans.  Some of the computers need to be rated by other means to give the
ratings a basis to start from.

<P>Compared with human players, computer players are strong tactically but weak
strategically, and are much better at blitz chess than at slow chess.  These
differences make it more difficult to assign a meaningful rating too.

<P>Several computers do play regularly on the Internet chess servers and have
achieved ratings there.  These ratings have the advantage of being based on
many games.  On the other hand, ICS ratings are only roughly comparable to
USCF or FIDE ratings.  Many players have ICS ratings that are hundreds of
points higher or lower than their USCF or FIDE ratings.

<P>Finally, unlike dedicated chess machines, or PC chess programs that run on
only a few different models of Intel processors, GNU Chess runs on many
different kinds of CPU at many different speeds.  Thus its strength depends on
how fast a machine you run it on and how much optimization your C compiler
does.  Some people have formulas for estimating how a computer player's rating
varies on faster or slower machines---see the rec.games.chess FAQ for more
information---but these need to be taken with a grain of salt too.

<P>All that said, here are some numbers.

<P>- On the Internet Chess Club, a copy of GNU Chess running on an SGI
Onyx R4400 under the handle MaxII has achieved a blitz rating of over
2500 and a standard rating of over 2300.

<P>- Wolfgang Gabriel ran the Bednorz-Toennissen Test BT2630 with GNU
Chess 4.0 pl74 on a 60 MHz Pentium with 16 MB of RAM.  The test gave
an estimated rating of 2213.  He also ran Fritz-2 on the same hardware
and got an estimated rating of 2311.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[B.3]">[B.3] Does GNU Chess run on a PC under DOS (or Windows, or OS/2)?</A></H3>

Yes.  There are several versions available.

<P><i>WinBoard</i> provides a graphical user interface to GNU Chess
that runs on Windows 95 and Windows NT.  See topic <A
HREF="#[D.2]">[D.2]</A>.  The WinBoard distribution includes a GNU
Chess executable for the Intel architecture, plus instructions and
patches (when necessary) for recompiling GNU Chess from the official
sources, available separately.

<P><i>GNU Chess 4.00 for Windows</i> bundles GNU Chess and a custom
graphical interface into a single program.  Unlike WinBoard, it runs
on Windows 3.1 if you have the Win32s compatibility package installed
(available free from Microsoft).
You can get GNU Chess 4.00 for Windows from
<A HREF=
"ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gnuchessPC-4.0.pl77.zip"
>ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gnuchessPC-4.0.pl77.zip</A>.
The distribution includes complete sources and an Intel executable.

<P>The standard <i>GNU Chess 4.0</i> distribution
can be compiled for MS-DOS, and will run under Windows in a DOS
box, but with no graphical interface.  Depending on what patchlevel of GNU
Chess you get and what C compiler you have, you may need to make minor source
changes to get it to compile.  Some precompiled versions are available in the
Internet Chess Library; the most recent at this writing is:
<A HREF=
"ftp://caissa.onenet.net/pub/chess/DOS/gch4077.zip"
>ftp://caissa.onenet.net/pub/chess/DOS/gch4077.zip</A>.

<P>Here is a listing of GNU Chess files for the PC in the Internet
Chess Library (topic <A HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A>).  They are scattered
among the directories /pub/chess/Win3, /pub/chess/DOS, and (don't
forget) /pub/chess/DOS/OLD-STUFF.  This listing may be outdated; see
the library itself to look for additions.

<P>
Porting GNU software to PCs is not a major focus of the GNU project, and these
ports are not supported by the FSF.  Contact the people who did the ports if
you have questions or problems.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[B.4]">[B.4] Does GNU Chess run on an Amiga?</A></H3>

There are at least three ports of GNU Chess to the Amiga.  As with the PC
ports, these ports are not supported by the FSF; contact the people who did
the ports if you have problems or questions.
<P>
The AmyBoard port (probably the best) is discussed in topic <A HREF="#[D.3]">[D.3]</A>.
<P>
UChess and AmigaGnuChess are available in the Internet Chess Library (topic
<A HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A>), in the directory /pub/chess/Amiga.  UChess is the newer of the two.

<H3><A NAME="[B.5]">[B.5] Does GNU Chess run on a Macintosh?</A></H3>

There is a port of GNU Chess 4.0 to the Macintosh.  It's available from the
Internet Chess Library (topic <A HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A>) under /pub/chess/Macintosh or
/pub/chess/uploads/Macintosh, in the following files:

<PRE>
    GnuChessMac40b5.hqx  - executable binary
    GCMsource40b5.hqx    - source

As with the PC ports, the Macintosh port is not supported by the Free Software
Foundation.  If you have questions or problems, contact Dan Oetting,
oetting@gldfs.cr.usgs.gov.
<P>
If you have the old Mac port of GNU Chess 3.0, be sure to get 4.0 instead.
GNU Chess has come a long way since version 3.0!

<H3><A NAME="[B.9]">[B.9] How do I build GNU Chess?  Do I need gcc?</A></H3>

The first step to building GNU Chess is to get the distribution file and
unpack it.  See topic <A HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A> for places you can ftp the distribution from.
<P>
To unpack the gnuchess distribution, gnuchess-*.tar.gz, put it into a new,
empty directory, cd there, and give this Unix command:

<PRE>
    gzip -cd gnuchess-*.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
</PRE>

If this command fails because you don't have gzip, see topic <A HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A>, and ask a 
local Unix expert if you need more help.
<P>
The above command will unpack all the files into a new directory.  Next, cd
into this new directory.  
<P>
Decide what directory tree you are going to install GNU Chess in.  The default
is /usr/local.  If you have write access to this directory tree, make sure
that it contains subdirectories bin, lib, and man.  (If you must "su" to get
write access to /usr/local, you don't need to do so until just before the
"make install" below.)  Type the following:

<PRE>
    configure
    make
    make install
</PRE>

If you are going to install GNU Chess under your home directory for personal
use, do this instead:

<PRE>
    mkdir $HOME/bin $HOME/lib $HOME/man
    configure --prefix=$HOME
    make
    make install
</PRE>

If you have problems or special requirements, see the files README, INSTALL,
Makefile.in, and configure.in for more information.
<P>
You don't need to have gcc to build GNU Chess.  However, GNU Chess is written
in ANSI C.  If you have only an old K&R C compiler, be sure you have the
current patchlevel of GNU Chess, and get "unproto" by:
<P>

It was released in comp.sources.misc Vol 27 with patches in vol 28 and
vol 38.  Among other places, it can be found on unix.hensa.ac.uk in
pub/uunet/usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume27/unproto.
<P>
Compile it and copy the cpp it produces into the gnuchess src directory before
you type "make" there.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[C.1]">[C.1] XBoard tells me "Error: first chess
  program (gnuchessx) exited unexpectedly".</A></H3>

Try running XBoard again with the "-debug" flag on the command line.  This
will print out all the messages received from GNU Chess.  
<P>
If you see this problem as soon as GNU Chess starts up, most likely GNU Chess
is exiting with an error message.  If you see the message "NO LANGFILE", it
means that you did not install GNU Chess correctly, and it is unable to find
the file gnuchess.lang.  Make sure that you defined LIBDIR in the gnuchess
Makefile, and that gnuchess.lang is in that directory.  If gnuchess.lang is
not there, you probably didn't type "make install" in the gnuchess src
directory; you must do this to install gnuchess.lang (and the gnuchess book).
If you defined LIBDIR to something that is not an absolute pathname (that is,
to something that does not start with a "/"), GNU Chess will work only if you
run it from the GNU Chess "src" directory where you built it.
<P>
If the problem happens while GNU Chess is running, you may have hit a GNU
Chess bug.  There used to be a bug that could corrupt the stack and cause
the program to exit, sometimes with a nonsensical message first, sometimes
with no message.  It was especially evident on Linux.
We believe this bug is fixed in GNU Chess 4.0.pl77.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[C.2]">[C.2] GNU Chess lets its flag fall a move or two
before the time control.
</A></H3>

GNU Chess is known to be a bit too aggressive in using its clock time and
sometimes lets its flag fall.  Some bugs that caused this symptom have been
fixed, but more work on the problem may be needed.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[C.3]">[C.3] GNU Chess (used with XBoard)
freezes after it gets out of its opening book.
</A></H3>

First, be sure you have the latest versions of GNU Chess and XBoard; see topic
<A HREF="#[A.4]">[A.4]</A> above.  If you do, and you still have this problem, check the following.
<P>
a) Perhaps the feature in GNU Chess that lets you stop it thinking on your
time by just entering your move is not working.  This feature relies on the
FIONREAD ioctl, which seems to be broken on some versions of Unix.  XBoard
uses this feature if the flag -DATTENTION is not present on the DEFINES line
of the XBoard Makefile.  XBoard 3.1 and later are distributed with this flag
already set, so you should not have a problem unless you have removed it.
<P>
b) You might have a persistent transposition table (hashfile) that has been
corrupted.  Look in the LIBDIR directory you defined in the GNU Chess
Makefile, and if you find a file named gnuchess.hash there, remove it.  Do not
use the hashfile if you are running multiple copies of GNU Chess at the same
time (for instance, with Two Machines mode in XBoard).  In fact, it is
probably best not to use the hashfile under any circumstances.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[C.4]">[C.4] GNU Chess (used with XBoard) sometimes

</A></H3>

a) First, be sure you have the latest versions of GNU Chess and XBoard; see
topic <A HREF="#[A.4]">[A.4]</A> above.  Several different bugs that could cause this symptom
existed in old versions but have been fixed in the latest ones.
<P>
b) Another possibility is that you have a persistent transposition table
(hashfile) that has been corrupted.  Look in the LIBDIR directory you defined
in the GNU Chess Makefile, and if you find a file named gnuchess.hash there,
remove it.  Do not use the hashfile if you are running multiple copies of GNU
Chess at the same time (for instance, with Two Machines mode in XBoard).  In

<H3><A NAME="[C.5]">[C.5] GNU Chess crashes when I try to compile and run it on the DEC Alpha.</A></H3>

Get the latest version of GNU Chess.  Some bugs that showed up only on the
Alpha are fixed in version 4.0 patchlevel 73 and later.  If you still have
problems, try compiling with the -migrate flag or the -O1 flag.  Some versions
of the Alpha C compiler have optimizer bugs that affect GNU Chess.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[C.6]">[C.6] Running (or building) GNU Chess fails with
a message about FIONREAD.
</A></H3>

The message looks something like this:

<PRE>
    FIONREAD: Operation not supported on socket
    You probably have a non-ANSI ioctl.h; see README. -1 45 4004787f
</PRE>
<P>
If you are using gcc to compile, the solution to this error message is usually
to go to the GNU Chess Makefile, find the line that starts "CFLAGS=" (with no
# character in front of it), and append the flag "-traditional-cpp" to the end
of the line.  Then do

<PRE>
    rm dspcom*.o gnuan.o
    make
    make install
</PRE>

to rebuild gnuchess.
<P>
If you aren't using gcc, we don't really understand why this should happen,
but we do have a brute-force workaround: You can simply disable the gnuchess
feature that uses FIONREAD.  Find all the places in dspcom.c (and gnuan.c)
where the line "#ifdef FIONREAD" occurs.  Change each of them to "#ifdef
NOTDEF".  Then recompile gnuchess.
<P>
With this code disabled, if you tell gnuchess to think on your time ("hard"
mode), you will have to type ^C to make it stop thinking when you want to make
your move.  The current version of XBoard does this automatically, so
disabling the code has no effect on XBoard.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[C.7]">[C.7] GNU Chess runs way too slow and makes my 
disk seek wildly.</A></H3>

This happens if you don't have enough real memory (RAM) to run GNU
Chess.  You may need 16MB or more.  You can reduce GNU Chess's memory
requirements by reconfiguring it, or just buy more memory.  Some
(rather out of date) suggestions are in the file doc/PORTING from the
GNU Chess source tree.

<P>The following is from Nikhil Nair:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is perfectly possible to run gnuchess on an 8Mb system.  I would 
suggest that you don't edit the source (though the defaults are the 
definitions of ttblsz or something like that in src/ttable.h and 
DEFETABS in src/gnuchess.h), but rather use the -C and -T command-line 
options (which even work for gnuan, though not documented in the manpage).

The defaults are `-C 18001 -T 150001' (for MS-DOS, -T 8001).  On my Linux 
system, this uses just over 9Mb.  From memory, `-C 6001 -T 40001' uses 
around 3Mb.  Fiddle with these and see what results you get.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Why does GNU Chess use so much memory?  The extra memory lets it keep large
hash tables that speed up its search and make it play better, and a large
on-line book that improves opening play.  If you have lots of memory you may
want to reconfigure GNU Chess to use *more* than the default amount.

XBoard is a graphical chessboard that can serve as a user interface to
the GNU Chess and Crafty chess programs, the Internet Chess Servers,
email correspondence chess, or your own collection of saved games.
XBoard is free software.

<P>As an interface to GNU Chess or Crafty, XBoard lets you play a game

watch a game between two machines.  
(See topic <A HREF="#[F.3]">[F.3]</A> below for information on Crafty.)

<P>As an interface to the Internet Chess Servers, XBoard lets you play against
other ICS users, observe games they are playing, or review games that have
recently finished.  You don't need GNU Chess for this.

<P>To play email correspondence chess with XBoard, you use it with the cmail
program.  See topic <A HREF="#[D.6]">[D.6]</A> below.

<P>You can also use XBoard as a standalone chessboard to play through
games.  It will read and write game files and allow you to play
through variations manually.  You can use it to browse games off the
net, or to review GNU Chess, ICS, and email correspondence games you
have saved.  It saves games in PGN (portable game notation), and can
read almost any game in algebraic notation.  These features are
available at all times, even if you do not have access to GNU Chess or
an ICS.

System, version X11R4 or later.  There are also ports of XBoard to Microsoft
Win32 (that is, Windows NT or Windows 95) and to the Amiga.  See topics <A HREF="#[D.2]">[D.2]</A>

The only way for two humans on different machines to play chess in real time

each player runs his own copy of XBoard, both of them log into an ICS, and
they play a game there.  Two copies of XBoard cannot communicate with each
other directly.
<P>
Instructions on how to get started with Internet chess are included with the
XBoard distribution.  The network addresses included in the XBoard
distribution may not always be current.  The oldest ICS is the Internet Chess
Club at chessclub.com, which now has a fee for registered use, but still allows
free unregistered use.  There are also many newer sites with no fees, using
the Free Internet Chess Server implementation (FICS).  Some current FICS sites
are fics.onenet.net (the most active), eics.daimi.aau.dk,
and chess.unix-ag.uni-kl.de.
On all these machines, the port number to use is 5000.
<P>
Note: If you don't have network connectivity to any ICS site, you can
run your own server using the FICS code.  You can get a copy by anonymous ftp
from the Internet Chess Library (topic <A HREF="#[A.3]">[A.3]</A>).  The code is changing rapidly,

WinBoard basically does not run on Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
Although you can use the program as a PGN viewer/editor under the Win32s
compatibility package, the major features (interfacing to GNU Chess and to

- Exit from your Web browser and restart it.
<P>
2) On MS Windows systems:
<P>
The exact procedure depends on which Web browser you are using.  Generally,
you need to select something like Helper Applications or File Types from an
Options menu or dialog, click the button that makes a new type, and fill in the
boxes:
<PRE>
    Extension: pgn
    Mime type: application/x-chess-pgn

You will probably have to give a full pathname for WinBoard; you will probably
be able to use a Browse button in the configuration dialog to look for it.
<P>
If your Web browser doesn't let you include arguments on the application
command line, you'll need to put a file named WinBoard.ini in the working
directory where the browser starts up WinBoard, containing the string 
<SAMP>-ncp</SAMP>.  Without the -ncp, WinBoard will try to start up GNU Chess
whenever you use it as a viewer.  This will work if you have GNU Chess
installed, and you might even prefer it if you want to have GNU Chess
available to analyze the games you view.
<P>
3) To confirm that your external viewer configuration is working, open one of
the following URLs and click on any of the game names shown.

<P>If you normally have to use the "-icscomm" command line option on

Unix machine, you are out of luck.)  Get the appropriate version of
timestamp or timeseal onto the shell machine via FTP; see the help
files on ICC and FICS for instructions.  Then simply run it when you
would normally run telnet.  In this configuration you are not protected
against lag between your PC and the shell machine, or for lag caused by
heavy load on the shell machine itself from other users.

<P>If you have a firewall between your machine and the ICS, you may
have a harder time.  The timestamp and timeseal protocols do
not work through firewalls, across serial lines, or across telnet
connections.  You have to run the timestamp or timeseal program on
a machine that can make a direct TCP connection to the ICS.  You may
or may not be permitted to do this, depending on your firewall's 
security policy.  See the section on FIREWALLS in the WinBoard help file,
and where it says to run "telnet" on your firewall
machine, run timestamp or timeseal instead.
In this configuration you are not protected

<H3><A NAME="[D.14]">[D.14] How do I play bughouse with XBoard or WinBoard?
</A></H3>

XBoard (and WinBoard) have simple but effective bughouse support.  Offboard
piece holdings are shown in the board window's banner, and you drop offboard
pieces using the right mouse button.  Press it over the destination square
to pop up a menu of pieces.
<P>
XBoard can display only one board at a time, but you can observe your
partner's game by running a second copy of XBoard and logging in as a
guest.  (Unfortunately, this is not possible if you are using the
-icscomm option.)  To observe your partner's games automatically, turn
on <I>Auto Observe</I> in the second XBoard's <I>Options</I> menu, and put your
partner on your ICS <I>gnotify</I> list.  Or on ICC, use the "follow"
command to follow your partner's games.

<h3><a name="[D.16]">[D.16] What is Zippy?  How can I interface a 
chess program to the Internet Chess Servers?</a></h3>

Zippy is an interface that lets GNU Chess or Crafty act as a computer
player on an Internet Chess Server.  Zippy is included in both the
XBoard and WinBoard distributions.  It is implemented as a small
amount of additional code within XBoard or WinBoard.  
For documentation, see the file
zippy.README, included in both distributions or available
from my chess Web page,
<A HREF=
"http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Tim_Mann/chess.html"
>http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Tim_Mann/chess.html</A>.
The version of zippy.README on my Web page is often more up-to-date
than those in the XBoard/WinBoard distributions.
You'll also find a "biography" of Zippy and pointers to the original
Zippy the Pinhead comic strips there.

These are the header files for the Athena Widgets library, which XBoard uses
heavily.  Some versions of Unix don't supply these files, but they are part of
the standard X distribution, freely available from MIT.

For general information on getting missing X sources, see the FAQ on
comp.windows.x.  Note that you may be missing only the header files, or you
may be missing the libraries themselves too.

HP-UX users are missing only the header files.  You can get them by anonymous

someone else at your site has already done this.)  Get the archive files
/hpux9/X11R5/Core/imake-5.04.tar.gz (imake and xmkmf, optional but useful) and

Thanks to Richard Lloyd for this information.
<P>
If you have the Xaw header files installed in a different place than the other
X11 headers, you may need to configure XBoard with an extra flag to help it
find them.  For example, if yours are in /foo/bar/X11/Xaw, try this:

<H3><A NAME="[E.2]">[E.2] Building XBoard fails due to
undefined symbols or missing include files.
</A></H3>

The configure script for XBoard looks for X libraries and header files in some
common places.  Sometimes it fails: If yours are installed in an odd place, it
may not find them at all.  If you have more than one version of X installed on
your system, it may find the "wrong" one, or occasionally it may find
libraries from one version and incompatible header files from another.  You
can work around these problems by telling the configure script where the files
are.  For example:

<PRE>
    configure --x-includes=/odd/place/include \
              --x-libraries=/odd/place/lib
</PRE>
<P>
The directory named in the argument to --x-includes must have a subdirectory
"X11" that contains the actual .h files.
<P>
Some linkers have bugs that cause bogus error messages when you try to link X
programs.  The configure script includes a workaround for a bug of this kind
that exists in some SunOS 4.x.x installations.  See the FAQ on comp.windows.x
for more information about problems of this kind.
<P>
If all else fails, check whether anyone else at your site has been able to
compile any X programs on your system.  Your X installation might be buggy.
If so, the system administrator at your site might know how to fix or work
around the problem.

<H3><A NAME="[E.3]">[E.3] I have problems using WinBoard on ICS with a modem.  I'm not running
  SLIP or PPP, but just dialing in to an ordinary login account ("shell
  account").</A></H3>

Here are solutions to some common problems in this area.
<P>
Some people want to connect to ICS through HyperTerminal or some other
terminal program first, then run WinBoard.  This is not how it works.
WinBoard wants to talk directly with your modem, acting as a terminal program
itself.  Start out with the modem "on hook" (not making a call).
<P>
Run WinBoard with a command line like this (adding more options if desired):

<PRE>
    start WinBoard /ics /icscomm com1
</PRE>

Use com2, com3, or com4 in place of com1 if your modem is connected to one of
those ports.  Leave out the "start" if this is the command line in an icon
you are making for WinBoard.
<P>
After you start WinBoard, you may need to change some of the options in the
Communications dialog (on the Options menu).  The dialog has the usual options
for talking to modems: bits per second, bits per byte, parity, number of stop
bits.  If you have to change anything in this dialog, you'll have to change it
every time you run WinBoard; there is currently no way to save these options
or specify them on the command line.  Sorry.
<P>
Next, type dialing commands to your modem in the text window that WinBoard
creates.  You may need to turn off Local Line Editing on the Options menu
while you are typing commands to your modem.  Turn it back on when you're
done.  See the WinBoard Help file for instructions if you see your typing
echoed an extra time after you hit Enter.

<H3><A NAME="[E.4]">[E.4]
I have problems using WinBoard on ICS with Windows 95 and SLIP
or PPP.  When trying to start up, it gets the error "Address family
not supported by protocol family" (or some equally strange message).
</A></H3>

WinBoard is a 32-bit application, but some Winsock (TCP/IP) implementations
support only 16-bit applications.  You get a strange looking error message
if you try to use a 32-bit application because
there is no standard Winsock error code number
for "32-bit application not supported."

<P>Microsoft TCP/IP works with both 16-bit and
32-bit applications, supports SLIP, PPP, Ethernet, etc., and is included
with Windows 95.   
If possible, I recommend that you uninstall
whatever Winsock you are using and install Microsoft TCP/IP instead.
For more information, see
<A HREF=
"http://walden.mo.net/~rymabry/95winfaq.html"
>http://walden.mo.net/~rymabry/95winfaq.html (the Win95-L FAQ)</A>.

<P>Trumpet Winsock 2.1 (and earlier) supports only 16-bit
applications, and hence does not work with WinBoard.  But there is a
beta-test release available that does support 32-bit applications.  
I have not tried it with WinBoard, but it 
should work.  See Trumpet's Web page
<A HREF=
"http://www.trumpet.com.au/wsk/winsock.htm"
>http://www.trumpet.com.au/wsk/winsock.htm</A>
for more information.

<P>A few versions of Winsock may have bugs that prevent
Windows timestamp/timeseal from working with them.  I'm not sure if
such bugs exist in any versions that actually have 32-bit support,
so this point might be moot.  Again, Microsoft TCP/IP is known to work.

  program gnuchesx on localhost: NO LANGFILE (file gnuchess.lang not found)".</A></H3>

This problem should not occur with WinBoard 3.4.pl1 and later.
It used to happen because some unzip programs (notably pkunzip) do not
understand long file names, so they would unzip gnuchess.lang as gnuchess.lan
and gnuchess.data as gnuchess.dat.
I have changed the GNU Chess port included with WinBoard to
use the shorter names.  However, if you want to recompile WinBoard,
you still need to use an unzip that understands long file names, because
some of the WinBoard source files still have long names.

XBoard and WinBoard have three major modes that can't be changed from the

a Windows program like WinBoard?</A></H3>

<P>There are many ways; pick your favorite:

<LI>Type the command line into an MS-DOS Prompt box.  Add the command
"start" in front of it to avoid tying up the box the whole time WinBoard
is running.  Example: "start WinBoard -ics".  Starting Windows programs
from an MS-DOS Prompt box works only on Windows 95
or Windows NT, but then, WinBoard itself works only on those systems.</LI>

<LI>Choose File|Run from the Program Manager, choose
File|Run from the File Manager, or choose Run from the Windows 95 Start
menu.  Type the command line into the dialog you get.  You may have to
give WinBoard's full drivespec and filename
if it is not in a directory on your search path.</LI>

<LI>Make a Program Manager icon for WinBoard.  You can do this by dragging
WinBoard.exe from the File Manager into the Program Manager, or by using
File|New in the Program Manager.  Select the icon and choose File|Properties.
Edit the Command Line text box to add the command-line options to the end.</LI>

<LI>Make a Windows 95 shortcut for WinBoard.  You can do this by
right-dragging WinBoard.exe to the desktop and selecting "Create
Shortcut(s) Here" from the menu that appears.  Then right-click on the
shortcut, select Properties, and click the Shortcut tab.  The
command-line text box is labelled "Target" instead of "Command line"
just to confuse you.  Edit this box, adding the command line options to
the end.</LI>

<LI>Bonus alternative, WinBoard only:  Make a file called winboard.ini
in WinBoard's working directory or a directory on your search path.
Put all the command line options in it.  Don't put the word "WinBoard"
in the file, just the options.</LI>

I don't really understand why this happens, but several people have reported
it.  They were all using SunOS 5.x (Solaris 2).  The following workaround
has been reported to fix it.  Recompile XBoard with the commands:

<PRE>
    configure --disable-ptys
    make

If you needed additional flags on the configure command line the first
time you did it, add them here too.

<P>This workaround may solve strange and mysterious problems on other
platforms too.  I'm not sure that the pty code (which is disabled by
the above command) is really needed at all, but it was included in
XBoard 1.2 by the original authors, and I don't have access to any of
the kinds of machines where it is supposed to be needed, so I can't

<H3><A NAME="[E.9]">[E.9]
When I exit from WinBoard after using it to play against GNU Chess
or Crafty, the chess program keeps running in the background.
</A></H3>

This is a bug in WinBoard, not yet fixed in the current version (3.4
patchlevel 1).  To work around it, always exit from WinBoard by
selecting the Exit item on WinBoard's File menu.  Do not select Close
from the system menu in the upper left corner of the window banner, do
not double-click in the upper left corner of the banner, and do not
press the Windows 95 [X] button in the upper right corner of the
banner.  In the latter cases, WinBoard does not take control and kill
off the chess program before exiting.

<p>Also, if you are using Crafty, be certain to get the version compiled
for Win32 (wcrafty.exe), not the version compiled for MS-DOS (crafty.exe).

When running WinBoard, I get the message
"Error getting user name:

WinBoard does not care if you are logged in "to the network."
WinBoard does ask Windows for your user name, for use in the PGN tags
of games you play.  Unfortunately, if you have your Windows 95
configured so as not to require you to log in, Windows pops up this

<h3><a name="[E.10]">[E.10]
WinZippy (the Windows version of Zippy) crashes Windows 95!

Unfortunately, this is quite true.  WinZippy tends to crash Windows 95
periodically, generally right at the start of a new game.  I don't
understand why this happens, I don't have a reliable workaround, and I
am not actively working on a fix.  It could be a bug in WinZippy, or
WinZippy could be doing something unusual that triggers a bug in
Windows 95.  If your machine is not absolutely wedded to Windows 95,
try running Linux (with xboard) or Windows NT (with WinBoard) instead.

Crafty is a rapidly evolving chess program. This rapid
pace of development is good, because it means Crafty is always
getting better. However, this can also cause problems with
backwards compatibility.

<P>To make life easier for the user, and also for the XBoard
developers, an "XBoard-supported" version of Crafty is being
provided. The "supported" version of Crafty includes some important
changes that make it work better with XBoard.

>ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/hyatt/crafty.tar.gz</a>.
But please be aware of the caveats mentioned on the Web
page before reporting "bugs" to the XBoard developers.

To use Crafty with XBoard, give the -fcp
parameter like this:
<PRE>
    xboard -fcp "crafty xboard"
</PRE>
You can add more Crafty command
line flags inside the quotes; see Crafty's documentation to find out
what they are.  You can add more xboard options at the end of the command line.
Also give the -scp parameter with the same value if you
want to use matchMode to have two copies of Crafty play each other.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="[F.5]">[F.5] How do I use Crafty with WinBoard?</A></H3>

<P>With WinBoard, you must use the version of Crafty compiled for 
Win32 (wcrafty.exe), not the version compiled for MS-DOS (crafty.exe).  
The MS-DOS version may appear to work, but it will generally
fail to exit when WinBoard tries to kill it.
This happens even if you select File|Exit to exit
(topic <A HREF="#[E.9]">[E.9]</A>).
Use the following command line:
<PRE>
    winboard -fcp "wcrafty xboard"
</PRE>
You can add more Crafty command
line flags inside the quotes; see Crafty's documentation to find out
what they are.  
You can add more WinBoard options at the end of the command line.

<P>As of this writing, WinBoard is behind XBoard in its support for
Crafty.  I'm not sure what versions of Crafty do and do not work with
WinBoard.  Hopefully we will be able to port the improvements in
xboard 3.5 to WinBoard.
