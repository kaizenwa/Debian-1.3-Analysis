To use ncurses, change the LIBS in snake/Makefile from -lcurses to 
-lncurses.

As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The originals
are in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

Also as usual, set the DESTDIR.  Also set the MANDIR, SCOREDIR, and
RAWSCOREDIR in snake/Makefile.

If you change any of the predefined paths, remember to make corresponding
changes in the man page.
