9/25/93 - Hunt needs to worked through to make sure it will run over a
	  network.

9/25/93 - Top level Makefile paramaters are inherited/everything works,
	  but man pages are not modified .... :(

9/23/93 - fix up inherited MANDIR, MAN8DIR (fortunes)
	  Maybe make the following:  MAN6DIR MAN6EXT MAN8DIR MAN8EXT

8/21/93 - use -I/usr/include/bsd instead of #include <bsd/sgtty.h>

8/14/93 - Review score file permission scheme.  Someone might appreciate it
	  being a little bit more secure ... especially in a multi-user
	  environment.

	  This could be better secured by having a games user or games
	  group, and letting the scoring programs run set group id or
	  set user id.
