9/25/93 - Installation directions
=================================

Installing Source Release:
--------------------------

  (Note, first cd to bog and decide if you want -DPURE or not -- see
      bog/README.linux for more information.  If you are in a hurry,
      don't worry about it ... it really is more of an aesthetic thing.)

  1.  cd to the top level directory in the source distribution.  i.e. the
      directory that contains this file.  (Your probably already here!)
  2.  Edit GAMESROOT to reflect you personal preferences.
  3.  type make
  4.  become root
  5.  type make install

  If something doesn't install correctly you probably have a non-standard
  Linux configuration. :) :) :)  Actually, let us know, we probably
  screwed something up.  (curt@sledge.mn.org or teffta@engr.dnet.ge.com)

  Each subdirectory has a README.linux file.  If you are still having 
  trouble with a program, check this file first -- it may contain some 
  helpful hints.


Installing Binary Release:
--------------------------

  1.  become root
  2.  cd /
  3.  zcat <bin-tar-file-name> | tar xvf -

  Files will go into /usr/games, /usr/man/man6 and /usr/man/man8
