As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still "compile"
under bsd.

Also as usual, set the DESTDIR in the Makefiles.  

There is no man page for this program.  

Hmmm ... Jonah, John, Jim, Jeffrey ... ???
Well ... Deuteronomy, ..., Judges, RUTH!, I & II Samueul, ... ???

Hmmm ... Joshua!  Yes, that's it.  Would you like to play a game?
