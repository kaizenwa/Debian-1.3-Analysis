As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

Also as usual, set the DESTDIR in the Makefiles.  There is no available
man page.  If you wish to create one, or know where to find one, please
let me know.

Morse takes text from stdin, and outputs morse code to stdout.
