To use ncurses instead of curses, edit canfield/Makefile to use 
-lncurses instead of -lcurses. Also edit canfield/canfield.c and
change the curses.h after #ifdef linux into an ncurses.h. And if
your ncurses stuff is installed in a non-standard place, I assume you
know how to otherwise change the Makefile. 

As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch. The original
is in Makefile.orig. Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd. Perhaps later I will enhance the Makefiles but it doesn't
seem worth the effort.

The binaries are meant to go in /usr/games. and the high score file in
/usr/games/lib/cfscores/. If you want to change these, set the DESTDIR and 
SCOREFILE in the Makefiles.  Also set the MANDIR in canfield/Makefile. 
Make sure the scorefile dir != DESTDIR or else you will overwrite the 
cfscores program (or not have a score file!).

If you wish your man page to be up to date, edit it to reflect
the locations if you place your binary in other than /usr/games
and your score file in other than /usr/games/lib.
