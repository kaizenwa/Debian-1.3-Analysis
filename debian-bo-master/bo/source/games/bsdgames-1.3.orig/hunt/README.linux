Finally, we have a version of hunt that appears to work!!!!!!
It hasn't been extensively tested, and may contain many bugs.  Note,
any problems would most likely be due to my mangling/porting the code.
The original authors have done a nice job.

Good luck using ncurses with this game! :)

As usual, set the BINDIR, LIBDIR, and MANDIR in the Makefile.  Also, you
can go through the Makefile and specify your desired game parameters.  Be
careful what you change, this Linux version is rather fragile.

One hint for those who have never played hunt before ...
  1.  Start the hunt driver:  % /usr/games/lib/huntd &
  2.  Now start hunt:         % /usr/games/hunt [options]
In other words, for best results, get the driver running first.

Happy hunting!  (And if you ever see "black tite" show up in one of your
hunt games, RUN!!!!!)
