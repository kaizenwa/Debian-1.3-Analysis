To use curses, change the #include in player.c to curses.h instead of 
ncurses.h, and change the LIBS from -lncurses to -lcurses in the Makefile.

As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

Also as usual, set the DESTDIR in the Makefiles, and edit the location
of the log file in pathnames.h.  Also set the MANDIR in the Makefile.
