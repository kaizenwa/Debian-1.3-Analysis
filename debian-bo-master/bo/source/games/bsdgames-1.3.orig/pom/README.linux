As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

Also as usual, set the DESTDIR and MANDIR in the Makefiles.

I added the following line, which probably was supposed to be in 
/usr/include/bsd/tzfile.h, but wasn't.

#define isleap(y) (((y) % 4) == 0 && ((y) % 100) != 0 || ((y) % 400) == 0)
