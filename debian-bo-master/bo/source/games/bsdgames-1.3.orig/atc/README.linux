To use ncurses, change the #include in include.h to ncurses.h instead of 
curses.h, and change the LIBS from -lcurses to -lncurses in the Makefile.

As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

Also as usual, set the DESTDIR, ATCDIR, SCOREDIR, and MANDIR in the 
Makefile.
