xabacus is an implementation of the classic Chinese abacus for X.

o   It has a built-in demo-mode that teaches the user:
    - how to count (from 1 to 20) using the abacus
    - how to perform simple additions 
    - how to perform simple subtractions.

o   In addition, there is a rudimentary facility for generating data that 
    may be used to write customized scripts for teaching other concepts.

o   The PostScript document, Abacus.ps, included in the distribution,
    describes every possible techinique for performing additions and 
    subtractions using an abacus (typing "make ps" will build the file).

o   Refer to xabacus.man, for details about command-line options and user-
    definable X-resources available.

This application has been tested on a SPARCstation 1, 1+ & 2 running SunOS 4.1
& 4.1.1B (color & monochrome) under X11R4.  It uses Xt, the X Toolkit, for the
resource and command-line parsing functions.  All other graphics are
implemented using raw Xlib calls.

The distribution contains:
    Imakefile                3 guesses...
    Makefile                 in case imake is not available
    README                   this file
    main.c,aba.c,Xinit.c     the source of all that is good...
    demo.c,maindefs.h            :
    main.h,demo.h                :
    resource.h                   :
    patchlevel.h                 :
    icon.bm                  bitmap for the icon
    Lesson?.cmd              3 script-files for the demo-mode
    XAbacus.ad               applications-default file (examples only)
    xabacus.man              man-page
    abacus.psaa,abacus.psab  (parts 1 & 2 of Abacus.ps)

To build xabacus, first unpack all the shar files. Then type...

xmkmf               (if you have it) will make a Makefile, otherwise edit the
                    supplied Makefile
make                will build the application
xabacus -demo ./    will run the application in demo mode (assuming the
                    Lesson?.cmd files are present in the directory in which 
                    you issue this command)
xabacus             will run the abacus in operational mode 
make ps             will create Abacus.ps from: abacus.psaa & abacus.psab; the
                    original PS file was split into 2 files of managable size.

For a site-installation it is recommended  that the Lesson?.cmd files be copied
to /usr/lib/X11/xabacus (or some other appropriate place; on the condition that
the reference to /usr/lib/X11/xabacus in the manual-page be modified to reflect
this new path).
