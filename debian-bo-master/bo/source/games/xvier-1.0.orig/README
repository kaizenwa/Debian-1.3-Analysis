xvier is a simple game where you and your opponent alternately throw
stones into free columns. The stones pile up in the columns, and the
goal is to get four stones in a row, in a column or diagonally. The
game compiles without modifications at least on

	Sun Sun4		SunOS 4.0, 4.1.1
	Sun Sun3/60		SunOS 4.0
	IBM RS6000		AIX 3.1
	HP 9000/720		HP-UX 8.05
	HP 9000/350		HP-UX 8.00
	DEC VS3100		Ultrix-32 V3.1
	DEC DS5400		Ultrix 4.2
	Sequent Symmetry	Dynix 3.0.17.9

To install xvier:

1. If you use Makefile.std, copy it to Makefile and choose locations
   for the X11-binary (default: /usr/local/bin), the game program
   (default: /usr/local/lib), and the manual page (default:
   /usr/local/man/man6).
   If you use imake, type "xmkmf" and "make depend".

2. Type "make".

3. Test the game with "./xvier -prog ./xvier_prog"

4. If it works, type "make install" (and "make install.man" with
   imake).

If you have problems with the compilation, look at the comments in
Makefile.std or Imakefile.

The game program uses a simple search tree, and the levels correspond
to the depth of this tree. Thus the higher levels are quite slow, but
normally I don't need them to get a good opponent ;-)
It's interesting that level 1 seems to be weaker than level 0.

You may use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its
documentation for any purpose and without fee. It is provided "as is"
without any express or implied warranty.

Have fun!
