(*) The old and obsolete version 1.0 had a nasty little bug that
    caused the game to crash in a certain situation in level 25.
    On normal UNIX systems (like Linux ;), this leaded to an exit
    with a message "Segmentation fault". On some exotic systems
    (like HP-UX and AIX ;), this leaded to a total system crash,
    where the system had to be rebooted completely.
    This bug is fixed since version 1.1, and I never had any bug
    reports about abnormal exits since then.

(**) The AIX system mentioned in (*) was used in a nuclear research
     center in Germany that probably wants to remain nameless.
