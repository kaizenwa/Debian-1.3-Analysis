1.3	- the 'names' file can now have any number of player names
	  (until version 1.2b, there was a limit of 10 players)
	  (old formats will be automatically converted to the new one)
	[14. September 1995]

1.2b	- added missing file "graphics/mirrormagic_iconmask.xbm"... -:)
	- a little change that was needed on 24bit static color displays
	- added an option to the Makefile for the location of the
	  include file "xpm.h" needed for the "libXpm" stuff
	[6. September 1995]
	
1.2	- much better name handling -> modified format of RAY.names
	  (the old format will be automatically converted to the new one!)
	- setup menu lets you change some things like sound settings
	- file handling was a bit broken in 1.0, 1.1 -> fixed
	- paths for level, score and name file configurable by Makefile
	  (allows one level file for all users but individual names file
	  for each user in networks with more than 10 users, for example)
	- added switch to let the score file having only one entry for
	  each player (useful when many players use one score file)
	[23. August 1995]

1.1	- some changes for HP-UX
	- some bugs fixed, some new bugs added
	- behaviour of the 'door field' is more friendly now,
	  so level 32 is solvable now
	- bad bug fixed that crashed game especially when in level 25
	- better icon :)
	- the problem with pacmen not moving *should* be fixed now
	- added level 48 (which was blank before)
	- maybe a better game handling (mirrors not moving several times)
	- very much better sound server which takes advantage of some
	  features of VoxWare(tm), the Linux Sound System
	- most buttons can be simulated by the keyboard
	- part one of a major code cleanup (to add some bugs ;)
