INSTALLATION

This directory contains a tcl/tk based setup tool for xblast named tkXBlast.
If you want a system wide installation, type:

$ xmkmf
$ make install
$ make install.man

If you want to test tkXBlast, without installing, just type

$ wish -f tkXBlast

but be sure that an xblast executable exits in the top directory.
If it fails try to change the variables marked with *CONFIG*
in the file tkXBlast.


ALTERNATIVE INSTALLATION

If you want a private installation of tkXBlast, you must
call the setup programm by hand.

$ setup <libdir> <binPath> <tkLibPath>

where <libdir> is the X11 library directory(typically /usr/lib/X11), 
it must contain the file rgb.txt. <binPath> is the path for the
xblast binary and for the xrdb command. Make link to xrdb command
in your private bin directory if needed. <tkLibPath> is the path
for the additional bitmaps files tkXBlast needs. e.g. ~/.tkXBlast.

Copy the file tkXBlast in your bin directory (check if it is executable)

Copy all the *.xbm files to <tkLibPath> (.e.g ~/.tkXBlast)

That should be all.
