			Known Maelstrom Bugs
                       ----------------------

Generic bugs:

	If Maelstrom crashes, your keyboard will be left in no-keyrepeat
	mode.  To fix this, just do 'xset r' after Maelstrom crashes.

	Also, during the Maelstrom game, keyrepeat is turned off.

   *	Sometimes asteroids leave trails behind them when they go offscreen.

	The compiled sprite code for clipping on the right side of the
	screen is broken.  I think I know what's wrong, but I've been lazy. :)


Netlogic bugs:

	The identifying blue dot will appear in single player mode if
	compiled with multiplayer support.


Linux SVGA version:

   *	For some reason, the key release events are occasionally being missed.
	Sometimes a key will get "stuck" between levels, or even in the
	middle of a game.  Just press the key and release it again.


DEC version:

   *	Maelstrom fading has crashed twm on at least two occasions.
	Just run Maelstrom with the '-nofade' option if you run twm
	or the fading crashes your machine.

	No sound support.


HPUX version:

	Sound sucks.  Turn the volume off by typing '0' on the main menu.


[*]  The reason for this bug is not currently known.
