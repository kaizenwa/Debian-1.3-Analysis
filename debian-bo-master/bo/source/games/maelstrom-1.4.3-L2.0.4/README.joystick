				JOYSTICKS

If you don't already have it, you need to download the Linux joystick
driver and install it to use the joystick support in Maelstrom.

Maelstrom was developed with version 1.7.3 of the joystick driver,
available currently at sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/kernel/patches/console

Note, you may have to tweak the driver some to get it to compile for
the current version of Linux.  It shouldn't be too bad.

Don't forget to create the joystick device and load the joystick module
before you start Maelstrom with joystick support!

Here's the command to create the joystick device:
(as root)
	mknod /dev/js0 c 15 0

When you start Maelstrom for the first time, you'll want to give it
the "-calibrate <device>" option, to calibrate your joystick.
"<device>" is the pathname of your joystick device, i.e. /dev/js0

Enjoy!
