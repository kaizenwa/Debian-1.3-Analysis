Hey folks, Check it out!

			M A E L S T R O M
            (Mac version 1.4.3 -- Linux version 2.0.4N)

			NETWORK PLAY!! :)

	You pilot your ship through the dreaded "Maelstrom" asteroid
belt -- suddenly your best friend thrusts towards you and fires, directly
at your cockpit.  You raise your shields just in time, and the battle is
joined.  The deadliest stretch of space known to mankind has just gotten
deadlier.  Everywhere massive asteroids jostle for a chance to crush your
ship, and deadly shinobi fighter patrols persue you across the asteroid belt.
But the deadliest of them all is your sister ship, assigned to you on patrol.
The pilot, trained by your own Navy, battle hardened by months in the
Maelstrom, is equipped with a twin of your own ship and intimate knowledge
of your tactics.  The lovely Stratocaster R&R facility never sounded so good,
but as you fire full thrusters to dodge the latest barrage you begin to think
you'll never get home...

	This is a port of the high resolution "asteriods" style arcade
game written by Andrew Welch for the Macintosh.  It is now freely supported
with additional network play on the Linux platform, courtesy of Sam Lantinga
(slouken@cs.ucdavis.edu).
