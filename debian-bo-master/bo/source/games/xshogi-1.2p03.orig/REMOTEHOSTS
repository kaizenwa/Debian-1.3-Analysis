If you want to use a remote host, you have to modify "xshogi.h".
The program "gnushogix" must be known. In case of trouble, create a
symbolic link to the gnushogi distribution , e.g. :
  ln -s $(HOME)/gnushogi-1.0/src/gnushogix gnushogix1
for the first gnushogi program. If you would like to let
two versions play against each other, establish a similar link
for gnushogix2.
