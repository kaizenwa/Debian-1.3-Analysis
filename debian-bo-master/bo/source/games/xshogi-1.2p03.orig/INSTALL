1. edit Makefile.custom. Normally only BINDIR need to be changed.

2. type 'make -f Makefile.custom' and all programs will be make.

3. type 'make install -f Makefile.custom' to install in BINDIR
                                           
You should use the same BINDIR as used for installing the
gnushogix program from GNU Shogi. Otherwise, you have to
edit the makefile changing the FIRST_PROGRAM and SECOND_PROGRAM
variables.

Other option:

  - use -DWESTERN_BITMAPS to choose the pieces more oriented to
    western chess.

  - use -DBOTH_BITMAPS for being able to choose between the eastern style
    pieces and the western style pieces.

  - use -DISS if you like to use xshogi as X client for the Internet 
    Shogi Server (ISS) (default)
