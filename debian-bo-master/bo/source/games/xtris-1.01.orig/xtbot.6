.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xtbot
is a robot (i.e an automatic player) for 
.B xtris, 
a synchronous multi-user version of Tetris.
.PP
.B xtbot
connects to an
.B xtris
server, registers itself as a bot, and simulates a game of Tetris whenever
a human player hits 'play'. 
.PP
The algorithms
.B xtbot
uses to decide where to put each piece are relatively simplistic, which
makes 
.B xtbot
quite easy to beat.  Also, 
.B xtbot
purposefully waits a little before dropping each brick, so that humans
can compete speed-wise.
.PP
.B xtbot
is started automatically by
.B xtris,
with the option '-quiet', when a player presses the 'bot' button.
.PP
Running copies of
.B xtbot
can be killed either by clicking on their name from an
.B xtris
window, or by killing the process.
