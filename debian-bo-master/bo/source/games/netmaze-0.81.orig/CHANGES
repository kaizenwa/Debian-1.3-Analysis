Changes since 0.71:
Some changes in the netprotocoll. (DON'T RUN WITH OLDER VERSIONS!)
Experimental audio support using /dev/audio. (ugly quality of the samples)
For >= 8bit color-machines:
  Experimental texturemapping at the walls and the floor. (option: -texture)
Cameramode.
Two new robots written by others (see CREDITS)

-----------------

Still in progress: the rewritting of the netserv. 
  (maybe it has some new bug-'features')
