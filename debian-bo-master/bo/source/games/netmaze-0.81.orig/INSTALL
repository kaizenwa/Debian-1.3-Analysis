Read the 'README' !! :-)
------------------------

for the impatient guys:

    edit:  config.h          (to select an environment)
    (edit:  audio.c,Imakefile)
    run:   xmkmf             (to generate a Makefile)
    type:  make              (to compile the whole stuff)

if an error occures:
    cp Makefile.alt Makefile (let us use the alternate Makefile)
    edit: Makefile           (and set all important (paths/options/CC/libs) )
    type: make               (to compile the whole stuff)
