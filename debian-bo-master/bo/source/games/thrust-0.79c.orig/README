Thrust version 0.79c

This is the 9th release of this program. I started to code it for MSDOG
but later I had a revelation so now it is converted to X and Linux/Svgalib.
It would take same work to convert it back and I am not going to do it.

This is the game from the C64 that you cannot live without.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

There is a web page that is supposed to be up to date. You can find it at
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~peda/thrust/, and it should contain
information about the latest developement. It also contains information
to help you build your own levels.

Thrust is free software. See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
