Version 0.79c February 25, 1997

* The "About"-code segfaulted, and so did the gamma correction
  option handling in some cases. Both are fixed.


Version 0.79b February 22, 1997

* Sound wasn't working. Another silly play_sound=0; assignment.


Version 0.79a February 21, 1997

* Sound wasn't working. Silly play_sound=0; statement removed.


Version 0.79  February 20, 1997

* Changed the interaction between the ship and the blob when they
  are connected and the ship is accelerated. The new behaviour is
  more correct and more like the original.

* Sound added to the Linux version. Uses the SoundIt library written
  by Brad Pitzel (pitzel@cs.sfu.ca). Sound was added to thrust by
  Maik Roeder.
  In addition, SoundIt has been adapted so that sound works for
  for Solaris, SunOS and HP-UX as well, but only if the sound device
  supports linear encoding.

* Configurable keys. Configuration is stored in ${HOME}/.thrustrc
  which is read at startup. See the included file "thrustrc" for
  an example of how .thrustrc can be written.

* X version understand the -display and -geometry options.

* Support for X-servers not capable of MIT shared memory.

* Added an option --gamma with which you can change the brightness
  of the colors.

* New rules applies for advancement to the next level. Also, there
  is a maximum altitude.

* 750 points (instead of 700) are given when the bunkers are shot down.

* Messages between the levels and a game over message.

* Portability changes. The X version now builds on Linux, SunOS 4.1,
  OpenBSD 2.0, Solaris 2.4/2.5, HP-UX 10.20, Irix 4.0.5, OSF1 4.0,
  AIX 4.2 and Ultrix 4.5. Very likely a whole bunch of others.
  Fix for OpenBSD by Kenneth Stailey, the rest by myself.


Version 0.73  January 14, 1997

* Added syncronization for fast systems. The X version was way too
  fast for some systems.


Version 0.71  January 13, 1997

* Preliminary X11 support. Only works with servers capable of MIT
  shared memory and limited to visuals with 8 bits per pixel
  pseudocolor.

* Compatibility changes and the use of GNU autoconf makes it
  possible to run the game on Solaris 2.5. With some luck, it
  works for other unices as well.

* The fired shots can destroy targets even when the hit is not
  on the screen.

* Fixed the door used in level 6.

* Made the mass of the blob configurable (REL_MASS in src/thrust.h).
  The mass of the blob is given in relation to the mass of the ship.
  The value is also changed from the previous 1.0 to 0.8 in responce
  to some requests.

* Updated man page. Most of the needed information is in there.

* Some memory allocation misfeatures corrected by Maik Roeder.

* Fixed the makefile. It didn't work if you didn't have the directory
  where the binary was supposed to be installed.
  Thanks go to Martin Wickman who pointed this out.

* Removed the bindist target from the Makefile in the binary
  distribution.

* Enabled the use of svga modes larger than 320x200. The game
  is simply drawn in a small area of the larger screen. Option
  --svgamode added. I've been able to play in 640x480, 800x600
  and 1024x768. Start with 'thrust -s G640x480x256'. 320x200 is
  still the default.


Version 0.67  December 22, 1996

* Fixed the nasty little bug which caused some "unexplainable" deaths.
  It must have been there for ages, but hasn't triggered prior to v0.61.

* Level 6 included. Pictures supplied by Christian Janoff. The door is
  still in need of some work as you will notice when you get there.
  The level is playable though.

* Fixed a small cosmetic bug in level 5.

* Joey Hess changed his email address *again*. ;-)


Version 0.61  December 19, 1996

* Level 5 included. Pictures supplied by Christian Janoff.

* New and improved title picture. Supplied by Christian Janoff.


Version 0.59  December 11, 1995

* Configurable keys.

* The guns are silent for a while when the plant has been hit. Thanks
  go to Wolfram Kleff since he pointed out this behaviour.

* Fixed a small bug with the teleport bars.

* Responds to the arguments -v, --version, -h and --help.

* Changed the internal representation of the definitions of the levels
  to make it easier to enter the block codes (was ½ and others, now
  normal ASCII).

* A breif description of how to make your own level.

* Man page, maintained by Joey Hess (joey@kite.ml.org).

* Binary version compiled ELF, not a.out.


Version 0.53  November 6, 1995

* ELF-problem fixed. Thanks go to Mirko Streckenbach. Now it should
  compile on ELF systems as well.

* The game enters a demo mode if not touched.

* The teleport bars at the end of a completed level.

* The game is now not as quick as it was before, making it easier.


Version 0.47

* Can't remember. That's why I'm starting this list.


Version 0.41

* The first version released for Linux and svgalib. Before this, the
  versions wasn't numbered.

___

The first version got on the way when I discovered that my new fancy
computer was able to update the whole screen in every retrace of the
monitor. This must have been in 1993 or 1994 with my 486DX50. Not a
very efficient way of scrolling, but this is still how it works.
