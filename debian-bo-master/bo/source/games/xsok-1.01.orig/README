Hi,
Here is a short checklist of what you need to compile and run xsok-1.00.

- an ANSI C compiler
- a POSIX.1 conforming system (OK, with some patches, you may do without)
- GNU gzip / gunzip binaries somewhere in your PATH (same comment)
- X11 R5 or R6 (older ones possibly work, but are untested)
- the XPM library (libXpm.*), preferably version 3.2g or newer. I used the
  dll version of Mitch DSouza (mitchum.dsouza@mrc-apu.cam.ac.uk) found in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/libs/X/libXpm-3.4c.tar.gz (28-aug-1994)
- LaTeX if you want to print the manual.

For a standard installation, type 'make', optionally 'make manual', then
(as root) 'make install'. Type 'install.fsstnd' if you want to install the
binary in /usr/games/bin instead of X11's bin directory (I prefer this).
If you want to install xsok locally, i.e. in your home directory, change
XSOKDIR and XSOKSAVE to $(HOME)/xsok in src/Imakefile, then type 'make'
and 'make install.local'. There is a patch for this in the diffs subdirectory.

Apart from Linux, this software has been tested on a HP 9000/720 (HP-UX 9.01),
which required commenting out the HAVE_USLEEP and BSD_NETKIT options in
src/Imakefile. Diffs for this can be found in the diffs subdirectory.

Compiling on a SUN (SUNOS 4.1.3) produced LOTS of warnings due to missing
prototypes in the non-ANSI include files, but the binary worked nevertheless.

If the installation succeeds, but you get the error message
'Cannot read floor.xpm', you perhaps have an older version of libXpm.
Simply gunzip $(XSOKDIR)/*.xpm.gz and be happy again.
(This was the case with both the SUN and the HP machine.)

Please report bugs to mbi@mo.math.nat.tu-bs.de.

Should you create new levels, I would be glad if you could send them to me.

        Have fun
           Michael
