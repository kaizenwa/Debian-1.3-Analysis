     	With long anagrams it is suggested that either the --length (-l)
or the --minimum (-m) option be used to limit the output (which can
run into 10's of megabytes depending on the length of dictionary
used.)
	If you wish to only find anagrams which are meaningful for the
phrase, then until a version of AN arrives which can do this
automatically there are two methods available.  The first involves
outputting the words than can be made to a file (using the --words
(-w) option), and editing this file, removing words you do not wish
to see in the resultant anagrams.  Alternatively, a word or groups of
words that you would like to see apear in every anagram can specified
using the --contain (-c) or --used (-u) options.
