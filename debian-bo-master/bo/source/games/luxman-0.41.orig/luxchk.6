.SH NAME
LuxCheck \- Tool to check LuxMan level files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B luxchk
[
.B \-l num
] [
.B \-v
]
.B file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B luxchk
is the tool used to verify the `correctness' of a LuxMan level file.
If you edit either the
.B level file
or the
.B maze bitmap
you should definately run
.B luxchk
before running the game with the new files.

If you do not run
.B luxchk
and there is an error in one of the files, you will
get a runtime error and LuxMan will abruptly exit.
Some errors are difficult to reproduce in the game,
and may seem to happen at random times. LuxCheck
will spot these and notify you of the problem.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fInum\fP, \fB\-\-level\fP \fInum\fP
Test only level \fInum\fP. The default is to check all
levels found. This option may be useful if you are
trying to fix a particular level and you want to save
time by not checking all of the other levels.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
Turn verbose message reporting on. This may be useful
if you are trying to determine where \fIluxchk\fP is
searching for its data files.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Show a summary of command line options.
.SH FILES
.B luxchk
expects to find level files in the current directory. Additionally,
it expects to see the following subdirectories underneath the
current directory:

/maps
/mazes

This is where it will look for bitmaps (images) and mazes,
repectively.
