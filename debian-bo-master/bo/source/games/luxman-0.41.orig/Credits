I have included several small packages in this distribution
so that others don't have to search for them. They are
written and copyrighted by:

./argv		``argv'' library, (c) 1993 Gray Watson and
		the Antaire Corporation.

		I have modified the Makefile and removed `extra'
		things like the info files.

		The complete package is available from:
		ftp.antaire.com:/pub/antaire/src/argv/argv.tar.gz

./rawkey	``rawkey'' library, (c) 1994 Russell Marks

		I have modified the Makefile a bit.

		The original package is available from:
		sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/libs/rawkey-0.2.tar.gz

		(Actually, I've included v0.21 which I don't think
  		 has been released yet.)

There are also some items gratuitously lifted from others:

(fonts)		The .font files were lifted from the LIBGRX
		distribution (using `grx2map', in the `gtools' subdir).
		Thanks to Csaba Biegl for writing this library and to
		Dan Jackson for porting it to Linux.

		LIBGRX is available from:
		sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/libgrx-1.03c.tar.gz

(sounds)	The sounds were sampled from an original Pac Man
		machine. I hope that no one suffers financial loss
		because of this. :)

Thanks for bugfixes:

		Michael Weller (eowmob@exp-math.uni-essen.de) -
		Patch to stop using FIFO's.
		
Miscellaneous thanks:

		The sound server and calibration routines were
		inspired by code in `sasteroids', written
		by Brad Pitzel.

		`sasteroids' is available from:
		sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/games/video/sast-1.5.src.tar.gz

		Thanks also to Dave (daveclem@eng.auburn.edu) and
		Bruce (rbtenis@ibm.net) for testing, letting me
		use their soundcards before I had one, etc., etc., etc.

		Thanks to Hannu Savolainen for the great sound drivers.

		Thanks to the authors of svgalib for the routine
		`vga_init()' and for the variable `graph_mem' :)
		(Um, oh yeah - and the mouse routines!)
