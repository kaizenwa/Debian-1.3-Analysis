	* rawkey.c: fixed VT switch termios problem. I had missed just one
	damn line. (sigh)

	* Test programs fixed. They used to call rawmode_exit after
	exiting from graphics mode rather than before, which meant they
	screwed up the 'susp' setting (among others). Bit embarrassing,
	really... *blush*

	* Should be callable from C++ now.

	* Fixed DEEPLY IRRITATING bug in rawkey.h. The FUNC_KEY() macro
	needed another pair of brackets around a ?: operator. It didn't
	look necessary to me, but it didn't work before and it does now.
	Guess I'd better brush up on my operator precedence. :-(

	* Fixed problem with old versions of bash not liking us leaving
	stdin as non-blocking.

	* Added vt switching stuff. You need to specify two functions, one
	for 'undrawing' your screen (i.e. returning to text mode) and one
	for 'redrawing' it (if your program refreshes all the time, you
	can just switch back to graphics mode). You then need to enable vt
	switching, which is then checked for whenever you use
	scan_keyboard(). Your program will pause whenever another console
	is switched to.

	* Bugfix: disable ctrl-c (this meant that pressing the '2' key
	would cause bad things to happen) and similar keys. In other
	words, turn off ISIG and ICANON.

	* Started changelog.
