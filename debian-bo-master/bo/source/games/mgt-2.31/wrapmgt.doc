       WWrraappmmggtt formats Smart-Go files as generated by mmggtt so that
       the lines are shorter than nn, the number specified on the
       command line.  The default format width is 79  characters.
       WWrraappmmggtt  reads  its input from stdin and writes to stdout.
       This means you should  invoke  it  using  I/O  redirection
       which  is  done under unix and DOS with wrapmgt < infile >
       outfile.

       The files are formatted in such a way that  if  the  files
       are  viewed  in  mgt after being formatted, they will look
       the same as the original.  The new  line  breaks  will  be
       visible from within the editor, however.
