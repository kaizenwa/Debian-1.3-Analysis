       mmaaiillggoo helps manage email  games  by  processing  Smart-Go
       game records received by mail, invoking mgt, and automati-
       cally sending your next move back.

       Invoking mmaaiillggoo with no flags  instructs  the  program  to
       search  the  specified  file  for a go game, ignoring mail
       headers or other such garbage.   mmaaiillggoo  will  invoke  the
       game  processor  specified  in  the  environment  variable
       MAILGO or of this variable is undefined, will  attempt  to
       run mmggtt from the inherited path.  If you give the filename
       -- then mmaaiillggoo will read its input  from  stdin,  allowing
       you  to  redirect  messages into mmaaiillggoo directly from your
       mailer.  Your mail program  may  not  support  redirecting
       messages  into  external programs.  Check it's man page to
       find out.  This option to use stdin as the input  is  only
       valid  if  you give mmaaiillggoo no other arguments.  (Technical
       note:  mgt is instructed to read its input  from  /dev/tty
       if you use this feature.)

       If  your opponent loses your move, you can resend the game
       with the -r switch.

       To start a new game, use the -n switch.  Without  a  file,
       you  will  be  prompted  for your address, your opponent's
       address, and the filename for both  your  and  your  oppo-
       nent's local game record.  The game processor will then be
       invoked for you to make the first move.  If a filename  is
       specified,  the  address  and  filename data is taken from
       that file.

       The -c switch causes the program to delete any  extraneous
       files  it  might  have created during a previous run which
       was abnormally terminated.  These  files  have  the  form:
       MailGo*

       To edit the mailgo headers (including mail addresses, file
       names and game record format) or the game record, use  the
       -e  switch  with the file name of the mailgo file you wish
       to edit.  The file may be a saved mailgo mail message or a
       processed  mailgo  game file.  The -e option will not mail
       changes because of the possibility of confusing addresses.
       To  mail edited files, use 'mailgo <file>' for edited mail
       messages and 'mailgo -r <file>'  for  edited  files  which
       have been previously processed by mmaaiillggoo..

       mmaaiillggoo  also  supports  go  board  sizes of 9x9, 13x13 and

        Trailing garbage ignored

       The game data file contains a leading tag to indicate  the
       start  of the data.  It contains both addresses, as should
       be used to mail the game files, and it contains the  files
       to  store  the  games  in.   In the example above, you are
       playing opponent@hissite, and the game is being stored  in
       my_game_record.

       The  file  format  used  can  be  either  long,  short, or
       extrashort indicated by L, S,  and  E  respectively.   The
       long format uses the full size Smart-Go file saved with no
       options from mgt.  The extrashort format uses mgt with the
       -s  option  to  save  short format files.  This format may
       cause problems for  some  mailers,  however,  because  the
       lines will grow longer than 512 bytes.  In any game record
       format, if very long comments are created, there is a dan-
       ger of causing mailer problems.  The short format is simi-
       lar to  the  extrashort  format  but  has  extra  newlines
       inserted.   The short format is the default when selecting
       format from the prompt, but the long format is the default
       if  a  file  contains no FORMAT line.  When mmaaiillggoo is used
       normally, the  file  specified  on  the  command  line  is
       removed  at  successful  completion,  and  the new game is
       saved to the file specified in the received  game  record.
       If  the destination file does not look like a mailgo file,
       mmaaiillggoo will query for confirmation.

       When a new game is started, the first mailgo message  con-
       tains  the  line  NEWGAME inserted before the FORMAT line.
       This is used to check for  the  overwriting  of  old  game
       records.

       mmaaiillggoo tries to handle the case where you start a new game
       but do not make the first move.  If after the  first  move
       you  have  a  reason to convince mgt that you have changed
       the game record  without  really  changing  anything,  you
       should enter and exit the comment editor.
