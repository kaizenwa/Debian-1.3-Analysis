.TH WRAPMGT 6  "23 November 1992"
.SH NAME
wrapmgt - wraps long lines in Smart-Go files to make them safe to post
or email
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wrapmgt [nn]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Wrapmgt
formats Smart-Go files as generated by
.B mgt
so that the lines are shorter than nn, the number specified on the
command line.  The default format width is 79 characters.
.B Wrapmgt
reads its input from stdin and writes to stdout.  This means you
should invoke it using I/O redirection which is done under unix and
DOS with wrapmgt < infile > outfile.
.LP
The files are formatted in such a way that if the files are viewed in
mgt after being formatted, they will look the same as the original.
The new line breaks will be visible from
within the editor, however.
