       Go is an ancient oriental strategy game based on the  cap-
       turing of territory.  The players alternate putting stones
       on the board, trying to surround as many  empty  intersec-
       tions as possible.

       MMggtt  allows the user to examine Go game tree files created
       through the Macintosh(tm) programs  SSmmaarrtt--GGoo  ((ttmm))  or  GGoo
       EExxpplloorreerr  ((ttmm))..   MMggtt  also has basic Go game tree editing
       capabilities and may be used to create or edit  game  tree
       files.   The  on-line material provided by a rather exten-
       sive and growing database allows many  hours  of  instruc-
       tional enjoyment of various studies and tutorials concern-
       ing the game of Go.

       MMaaiillggoo is a utility which manages E-mail  Go  games  using
       mmggtt  as  the  Go  board editor.  It is included in the mmggtt
       package.

       The mmggtt program was originally developed to be a companion
       for  the  series,  "From  My  Go  Teacher",  archived bsd-
       server.ucsf.edu for ftp.  Also available is  the  Internet
       GO  Board communications program, 'go', also by Greg Hale,
       which connects up two terminals in real-time  anywhere  in
       the world, and the clients for the Internet Go Server.

               Invoke a set of options used by the mmaaiillggoo program
               for managing email games.  If a filename is speci-
               fied  for  loading (see below), the game record is
               loaded, and mmggtt automatically moves to the end  of
               the  main  variation of the game record.  The game
               can be modified without confirmation.  If the game
               record has been modified, it will be automatically
               saved, on exit, to the  filename  specified  after
               the -m and mmggtt will return success (zero).  If the
               game record has not been modified, or has not been
               allowed  to be saved, then mmggtt will return failure
               (nonzero).


       --ss      Change save format used to write save files.   The
               default  save  format  is the long format Smart-Go
               file.  Using this option results in  short  format
               Smart-Go files.

               playing on the board.  The key for making  a  move
               has  special  behavior in this mode.  See the sec-
               tion on the "space or 0" keyboard  command  for  a
               description.


       ffiilleess   These  are  the  files to be loaded.  The Unix and
               IBM version support  wildcards.   If  no  file  is
               specified,  mmggtt  loads  a  blank  board.   If  you
               attempt to modify a file that was loaded, mmggtt will
               prompt for confirmation the first time.

       MMggtt  can  be  used to view and edit game records, or as an
       electronic game board for a two person  game.   There  are
       many  keyboard  commands which execute the various editing
       and display functions.

               by the > < around the captured stones on the lower
               right.   Normally,  this adds the move to the game
               tree and moves to a new node.  In tutor  mode,  it
               checks  the various game continuations.  If one of
               them contains the move you made, it moves to  that

       x       Set/unset white stones.


       q or ESC.
               Quit.   q  will prompt for confirmation.  ESC will
               not prompt for confirmation.


       v       Create a variation below the  current  node.   The
               variation will initially contain a null node.  You
               must move to that variation to make a move in  it.
               If  the  "v" command is invoked at a node which is
               at the end of a variation, variation "A"  is  cre-
               ated  with a null node.  Subsequent invocations of
               the "v" command will create the "B", "C"... varia-
               tions.


       !       Cut  tree.   Moves the current node and everything
               below it to a temporary  holding  buffer.   (Moves
               your  location  back to the parent of the node you
               are one when you invoke it.)


       ^       Paste tree.  Pastes the temporary  holding  buffer
               in  after the current node.  Usually the  opposite
               of cutting the tree.


       c       Edit the current comment.  The editor has two mod-
               els  of  operation.   The  default  model has been
               vaguely designed after emacs.  That means that the
               editor   commands  are  either  'control-key'   or
               'escape-key'.   The  controls   are   configurable
               through  an  environment  variable.   The notation
               "^key" is  used  to  indicate  control  keys,  and
               "]key"  is  used  to indicate keys which should be
               preceeded by the escape character.

               On some terminals, instead  of  ESC-key,  you  can
               press  Alt-key  or Meta-key.  (On the IBM version,
               you can use the Alt key.)  Under VMS, the ESC  key

               does not work.  VMS users may need to redefine the
               edit keys.

               The second edit model was vaguely  designed  after
               vi.  That means that the editor has a command mode
               for cursor movement, etc. and an insert  mode  for
               inserting  text.   The  vi  model editor starts in
               insert mode.  The ESC key changes mode from insert
               mode to command mode.  If pressed in command mode,
               the ESC key exits the comment editor and saves the
               comment.   The  letters below are typed in command
               mode to obtain the specified function.   To  leave
               command  mode  and enter insert mode, you must use
               the function which is listed as  the  insert  mode
               command.  This defaults to 'R'.   To select the vi
               like mode of operation, put _ASCEDVI in  your  MGT
               environment variable.

               Defaults are:

                   exit, don't save comment      ^W      q

               Pressing  c on a comment larger than the 120 lines
               allocated for comments will cause the extra to  be
               lost.   Also,  on  terminals which generate IBM PC
               arrow key codes, the  arrow  keys  will  correctly
               move  the  cursor  within the comment editor.  The
               arrow keys only work in the emacs based model.


       d       Delete node.  Deletes the current node,  replacing
               it  with  its  child.   If the current node has no
               child, then clear the properties  of  the  current
               node.

               previous string.)


       to get the default characters.  (This is csh syntax.   For
       other  shells,  the syntax will be different.)  Place this
       line in your .cshrc so the alternate characters are always
       in effect.

       The  _ASCCOM string allows you to change the keyboard com-
       mands.  Upper case letters stand for control characters.

       The _ASCCHAR string specifies the display characters.  For
       example,  to  use @ for black stones, change the # to @ in
       the _ASCCHAR string.  You need only include one of the two
       declarations  ("_ASCCOM:" or "_ASCCHAR:") if you only want
       to change the commands or characters but not both.

       To set the default display  type  to  inverse  video,  use
       _ASCINV in the MGT environment variable.

       To  set the comment editor commands, use _ASCED in the MGT
       environment variable.

       For the _ASCED environment variable setting in  the  emacs
       based editor model, control keys are specified with a cap-
       ital letter, and ESC keys are anything which is not a cap-
       ital  letter.   This  is  the key string for the defaults:
       PNpnBFAE<>DKIzO.  Note that ^V, ^O, ^C  and  ^Z  are  poor
       characters  to  use for anything if you have berkeley unix
       because the berkeley tty drivers interpret  these  charac-
       ters.   The  ^V  character  is the quoting character which
       quotes the following character.  You will need to press it
       twice  for mgt to see it.  The other characters have to be
       quoted by first pressing ^V or mgt will not recognize your
       keypress.   You  cannot  use ^H or ^? for anything because
       the  editor  always  interprets   these   as   destructive
       backspace.

       For  the  _ASCED  environment  variable  setting in the vi
       based editor model, no special processing is done  on  the
       characters.   In  order  to specify control keys, you must
       place actual  control  characters  into  your  environment
       string.   The  default string has two control commands (^B

       The  vi  based  editor  model may be selected be including
       _ASCEDVI in the environment variable.

       you  can  do this most easily by editing a file which sets
       the environment.  Vi can insert most of the control  char-
       acters directly.

       In all cases, when you set your own keys, you must set all
       of the keys, and they must appear in  the  correct  order.
       If  you  give  assign the same key to different functions,
       then an arbitrary one will be used by mmggtt  and  the  other
       functions  will be unavailable.  If multiple contradictory
       specifications occur in the mmggtt environment variable,  the
       last  that appear will be used by the program.  Any option
       not specified will assume the  default  values  identified
       above.

       With  the  IBM  version,  the same effects may be achieved
       under DOS 4.0 or DOS 5.0 with a SET command placed in  the
       AUTOEXEC.BAT  file.   Under  previous DOS versions, quotes
       were interpreted literally and "|", ">" and "<" characters
       have special meanings and thus cannot be put into environ-
       ment variables with the SET command.

       Under VMS, the command is just MGT = "_ASCCHAR:..."

       The bottom line indicates that Black has  just  made  move
       #11.   On  the bottom right, the angle brackets around the
       white stone indicate that it is White's turn.  Above that,
       the  word  "read"  indicates that the Smart-Go file hasn't
       been modified, and "long" indicates that the default  save
       format  is  the long format.  "Read" will change to "edit"
       if you modify the file, and it will  say  "tutor"  if  you
       enter tutor mode.
