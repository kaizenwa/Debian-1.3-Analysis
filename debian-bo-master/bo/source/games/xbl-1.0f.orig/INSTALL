================================ Xbl ====================================

This game is a 3D extension of Tetris on X11.

Installation :
--------------
	Modify ``Makefile.in'' if necessary
	   Important values are :
		GROUPGID    is the executable file GID.
			    (GROUPGID=2)
		USE_SETGID  protect score. 
			    Protected by 's' GID bit by default.
	   If you have neither ``xmkmf'', nor ``imake'', customize
	   the following values :
		SCOREDIR    contains the score directory place. 
			    (/usr/local/lib/xbl)
			    ( $(LIBDIR)/xbl with xmkmf or imake)
		RESOURCEDIR contains the X11 app-defaults directory.
			    (/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults)
			    ( $(XAPPLOADDIR) with xmkmf or imake)
		BINDIR      is the binary's directory where to install 
			    the executable.
			    (/usr/local/bin)
			    ( $(BINDIR) with xmkmf or imake)

	Type ``configure'' to create ``Makefile''
	Type ``make''.
	Test ``bl'' program to find best defaults :
		- Find best buffering.
		  The more interesting buffering methods are 3,1,2.
		  Method 2 works on any screen, but heavily uses resources.
		  Choose the fastest method that doesn't flick.
		  For more details, see "xbl-man.html" file.
			Option = -buffer
		  
		- Choose the keyboard configuration
		  1:AZERTY 2:QWERTY| 3:AZERTY- 4:QWERTY- 5:SPATIAL
			Option = -keyboard
		  "SPATIAL" is another 3d tetris.

		- If the buttons are moving too slowly, reduce their height.
			Option = -buttonheight

	Put your defaults in "Xbl.ad" file.
	If ok, ``su root'' and ``make install''.
	You play with ``xbl''.

Configuration :
---------------
	Xbl Parameters are searched in X database under name "xbl.args";
		in $RESOURCEDIR/Xbl (by default /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xbl);
		in $SCOREDIR/Xbl (by default /usr/local/lib/xbl/Xbl);
		in server resource database;
		in XBLOPTIONS shell variable;
		in real args of the program.
	There's only one resource name, but parameters are independent.
	For example :
		xbl.args: -buffer -1 -color 1 -x 5 -y 5 -smooth

	Test ``xbl'' and choose the best buffer mode.
	You will indicate this mode in X database.
	Buffering mode 2 works on all hosts/screen (though slowly).
	If all your keyboards are identical, select the good one.


I would highly appreciate if I received a mail from you telling :
	- Your configuration problem
	  (don't forgot computer type and XBL version) 
	- The enhancement you would like.
