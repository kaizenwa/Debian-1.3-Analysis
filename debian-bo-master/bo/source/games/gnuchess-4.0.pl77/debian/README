This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of Gnuchess.
The original GNU chess playing program, from which Gnuchess is derived,
was written by Stuart Cracraft.

This package was put together by Nikhil Nair <nnair@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from:
 prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/gnuchess-4.0.pl77.tar.gz

Gnuchess normally uses around 9 Mb of memory per invocation, and runs
*very* inefficiently if partially swapped out.  See
/usr/doc/gnuchess/debian.README if you want to reduce the memory
requirements (Gnuchess can be configured to use less than 3 Mb).


Changes made by Nikhil Nair <nnair@debian.org>:
 * set up configurable memory usage (see /usr/doc/gnuchess/debian.README)
 * fixed slight `make clean' problem in src/Makefile.in

Changes made by Ian Murdock in the original Debian release:
 * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
 * changed installation targets from /usr/bin and /usr/games
   to /usr/games and /usr/lib/games
