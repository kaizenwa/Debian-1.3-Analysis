Yikes! It's a bug!

Ok, I'm sorry, but if you follow these steps, I'll see what I can do.

-- First make sure that the bug is reproducable. In other words, start
the game again and see if the same thing happens again.

-- (If possible) recompile Xtrojka with the DEBUG_INFO flag turned on
and start the game with the '-d' option.  Now messages will be shown in
the window from which you started the program. Redirect them to a file
and mail it to me together with the report-form. Like this:

	xtrojka -debug 2>err_list;

-- Fill in the form as completely as possible and mail it to me. The
address can be found in the AUTOR file.  When describing the systems and
window manager stuff, also mention the version numbers.
