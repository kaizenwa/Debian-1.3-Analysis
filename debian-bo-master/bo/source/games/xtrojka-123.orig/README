                           Version 1.2.3
                  Trojka for the X Window System 
              Copyright (c) 1994,1995,1996 Maarten Los


(Please read the file 'COPYRIGHT' first.)

INSTALLING

- Unpack the distribution. A subdirectory named 'xtrojka123' will be
  created.

- Edit the Makefile to change your system's specific settings.

- Copy one of the 'XTrojka.???' files to 'XTrojka'. Currently the
  following XTrojka files are shipped.

	XTrojka.us	English version configuration
	XTrojka.nl	Dutch version configuration
	XTrojka.hu.tmp	Unofficial Hungarian version configuration.

  Read the information in the files on how to make more language
  versions.

- Type 'make'.

- To install it, type 'make install'.

- To clean up the directory from unneeded stuff, type 'make clean'.

- With 'make tar' you can make a tar file of xtrojka.

- Also copy XTrojka to the app-defaults directory on your system

- If you use XPM, you should at least have version 3.4d of the library,
  since it fixes a pallette bug. It also works with earlier versions,
  but don't be surprised if things crash.

Trojka should run on the following configurations

- Sun Sparc running SunOS 4.3 or Solaris 2.3
- Sun386i systems running SunOS 4.2
- Linux boxen.
	
It's interesting to put the highscore file in some network shared
directory. When playing, track is kept of new high scores of other
players on the network. Beware: the locking mechanism is poor. It
sometimes goes wrong, but only warnings are given. You can turn of
locking, by uncommenting the -DLOCKING flag in the Makefile.

If you had to change major things in the Makefile or the source-code,
to make it running on your system, PLEASE mail the changes to me, so
that the versions are managed centrally and I can keep them up to date.
Mail them to one of the addresses below.

	maarten@djoe.iaf.nl

		OR

	maarten@mosa.iaehv.nl (HOME mail)

Of course I like receiving email, so feel free to mail me to say what
you think of this program.

(To be sure, check the file AUTHOR, which contains my latest email address)
