This file documents library maintenance; it is for the guidance of game
designers and system administrators.

imf.dir is the directory of all images in this library.  It is merely
a list of image names along with the filenames where their data is kept.
The purpose is to speed up image loading by reading only a subset of
the image files.

There are two ways to rebuild imf.dir; by running

	makedir.sh *.imf >imf.dir

or

	makedir.pl *.imf >imf.dir

The first is a Bourne shell script, and the second a Perl script; every
system that can run Xconq has either /bin/sh or Perl.

game.dir is a list (in GDL syntax) of games that should appear in new
game dialogs for players.  These games should be real games that have
been somewhat tested, so the casual browser doesn't get thrown into
some sort of horrible alpha-quality experiment.
