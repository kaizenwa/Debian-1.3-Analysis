; I wrote these because I didn't like the collection of small US towns in
; the default names.  They are an eclectic collection of place-names, weird
; allusions & random thoughts.  If you like, you can think of it as my
; Finnegan's Wake.  ;^) I'm sure even the misspellings have Freudian (&
; Jungian!)  connotations.  It must still be considered a work in progress.
; Its been run through a Unix 'sort -df', of course (Joyce was _so_ 19th
