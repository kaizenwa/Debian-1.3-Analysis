@subsection Beyond the Designer Palette

The designer palette and privileges just scratch the surface of what you
can do with @i{Xconq}.  You can define your own complete games with @i{Xconq}
using its Game Design Language (GDL), a declarative Lisp-like language
with many more capabilities than could be provided interactively
(in much the same way that HyperTalk(tm) scripting
adds to basic HyperCard(tm)).
The @i{Xconq} manual chapter ``Designing Games with @i{Xconq}'' goes into
much more detail about @i{Xconq}'s programmability,
and the chapter ``Reference Manual''
is the complete description of GDL's abilities.
