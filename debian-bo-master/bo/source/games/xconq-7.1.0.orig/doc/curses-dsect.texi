@section Designing with Curses Xconq

Although @file{cconq} does not have the richness of display that
is best for designing games, it does have a basic set of commands
for that purpose.

@itemize

@item
`@code{|}' @code{set-unit-type} .
This command asks for the unit type that you would like to be the
current type to create.

@item
`@code{\}' @code{add-unit} .
This command adds a unit of the current type to the current location.

@item
`@code{~}' @code{set-terrain-type} .
This command asks for the terrain type you would like to paint.
The prefix argument sets the radius of the area to paint.
The default radius is 0, which just paints a single cell.

@item
`@code{`}' @code{paint-terrain} .
This command applies the current terrain type to an area with the
current radius around the current location.
