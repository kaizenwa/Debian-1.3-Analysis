INSTALLING XCONQ

1. Decide which versions you want.  For non-Unix systems, you will
need to go to the appropriate subdirectory, and read the instructions
there on how to configure and compile the sources for the desired
system.  Some systems (such as the Mac) may have an already-built
executable available.  For Unix (and VMS) systems, keep reading here.

2. Decide on the user interface(s) you would like to use.  The curses
interface uses only terminal graphics and will therefore work almost
anywhere, but the X11 interface both looks better and is easier to
play.  Currently, only the X11 version allows multiple human players.

3. Decide whether to use "configure" or "imake".  If you don't know
which to choose, choose the "configure" way and go to 3a.  If you
prefer the "imake" way, go to 3b.  You should do only one of these,
never both.

3a. Type "./configure".

If you want to be able to read XPM files, and the XPM library is
available on your system, add the argument "--with-xpm" to your
configure command.

The SelFile file dialog library may have problems compiling and/or
linking, but it is not required for Xconq.  If you don't want to try
to fix it, you can disable by adding the argument "--disable-selfile".

If you want to install into a nonstandard place, such as /usr/local,
add the argument "--prefix=/usr/local".  This will put executables
into /usr/local/bin, and game library files into /usr/local/lib/xconq.
The default is to install everything under /usr/games; executables
in /usr/games/bin, library files in /usr/games/lib/xconq.

3b. Type "xmkmf", then "make Makefiles".

4. Type "make".

If you want to build xconq only, then say "make all-xconq" instead.
Similarly, for cconq only, say "make all-cconq".

5. If you want test things out before installing, just cd to "curses"
and say "cconq" or cd to "x11" and say "xconq".  You will need to add
an argument like "-L ../lib" if you want to get the game libraries in
this distribution; otherwise Xconq will use whatever games have been
installed already.

6. If you want to install Xconq in your system, type "make install".
The default installation is into /usr/games for xconq and cconq, and
into /usr/games/lib/xconq for the game modules.

If you want to install xconq only, then say "make install-xconq"
instead.  Similarly, for cconq only, say "make install-cconq".

If you want to put the executables into the traditional /usr/games
instead of /usr/games/bin, add "bindir=/usr/games" to the make install
command.

If you need to install X application defaults somewhere other than
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults, add "appdefaultsdir=<xxx>" to the make
install command.

If you do not have a program or script "install" on your path,
you can use the "install.sh" in this directory by adding
"INSTALL=<abspath>install.sh" to the "make install", or you can
even use "cp" by saying "INSTALL=cp INSTALL_DATA=cp".

7. The man pages just tell how to start up the programs; the full
Xconq manual has complete details on everything.  A lot of behavior
can be figured out by experimentation and by using the extensive
online help; you can always get to it by typing '?'.

8. If installed in a public place, announce availability.  The library
file "news.txt" provides a convenient place to put in any notes
about changes, new games/scenarios, and so forth.

PROBLEMS

Some systems may need you to add CFLAGS=-DSYSV to your make command,
in order for SelFile to compile correctly.
