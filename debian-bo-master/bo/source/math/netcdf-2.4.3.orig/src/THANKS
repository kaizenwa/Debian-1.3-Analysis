The NASA CDF data model, to which netCDF owes much, was developed by
Michael Gough and Lloyd Treinish.  Joe Fahle designed a C version for a
CDF-like interface and discussions with Joe provided much of the
inspiration for the original netCDF C interface.  The netCDF C library
was written by Glenn Davis.  The nctest test suite, ncdump, ncgen, and
C++ interface were written by Russ Rew.  The XDR library is from Sun
Microsystems.  The FORTRAN jackets and FORTRAN test code were written by
Cathy Cormack.  The port library, configure-based installation system,
and generalized hyperslab access implementation and test code are by
Steve Emmerson.
