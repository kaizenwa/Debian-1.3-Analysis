This directory contains the source code for the netCDF FORTRAN jackets for
various systems, generated from a single source with the m4 macro processor.
The resulting generated sources for some platforms on which they cannot be
easily generated (e.g. VMS, OS/2, MSDOS) are in subdirectories.  Don't
despair if your system is not identified by one of the supported platforms;
one of these or a trivial variation will work with many C/FORTRAN
combinations.  In particular, many UNIX systems seem to work fine with the
Sun version.

To generate and test one of the supported sets of jackets try

	make OS=<os>

where <os> is one of sunos, ultrix, aix, unicos, vms, or msoft.  Note that
the msoft Fortran interface requires some additional files supplied in the
msoft subdirectory.

If that works, install the jackets library with

	make install OS=<os>

To remake the FORTRAN jacket C source (jackets.c), the corresponding FORTRAN
"include" file (netcdf.inc), and a FORTRAN driver program to test the
FORTRAN interface (ftest.f) for a different platform identified by the OS
macro, just

	make clean
	make OS=<os>

You can use any value of the OS variable for which there is a corresponding
$(OS).m4 files, e.g. sunos, vms, unicos, ultrix, aix, msoft.  This will also
compile a FORTRAN test program and run it, to verify whether the resulting
interface works.  "netcdf.inc" is a file of declarations that should be
included in FORTRAN programs that use the netCDF interface.

If one of the provided versions of jackets doesn't work on a new platform
"foo", just create a "foo.m4" that encapsulates information about how C
functions are called from FORTRAN and in particular how FORTRAN character
string parameters are handled.  sunos.m4, vms.m4, aix.m4, ultrix.m4,
unicos.m4, and msoft.m4 provide commented examples of how to do this.  If
you get the FORTRAN jackets working on a new platform, please contribute
your .m4 file to our collection, either by posting to the mailing list
netcdfgroup@unidata.ucar.edu, or sending to russ@unidata.ucar.edu.
