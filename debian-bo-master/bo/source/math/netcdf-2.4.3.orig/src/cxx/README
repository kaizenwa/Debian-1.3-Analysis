This is an early release for a prototype experimental implementation of a
C++ interface for the netCDF data access library.  It presumes you already
have netCDF installed.  The files are:

   netcdf.hh	the C++ interface
   netcdf.cc	the implementation of the interface, on top of the current
		C library interface
   nctst.cc	a test program for the interface that creates a netCDF file
		and then dumps out its contents in ASCII form to stdout.
		This example may also be helpful in understanding how the
		interface is intended to be used.
   example.c	example of C code needed to create a small netCDF file
   example.cc	analogous example of C++ code needed to do the same thing
   Makefile	makefile for building nctst
   ncvalues.hh	interface for auxilliary classes of typed arrays needed by
		netCDF interface; fairly simple
   ncvalues.cc	implementation of auxilliary classes of typed arrays needed by
		netCDF interface
   nc.txn	preliminary class documentation for the experimental C++
		interface, in Texinfo form.
   nc.info	preliminary class documentation for the experimental C++
		interface, in info form, as generated from the Texinfo
		source file.  The commented example program nctst.cc may
		also be useful for understanding the interface
   README	this file
