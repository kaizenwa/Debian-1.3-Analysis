Changes since 0.2.0

   1.  MAX/MIN macros changes for clean compilation on ALPHA/AXP systems.
   
Changes since 0.1.2 

   1.  Added new REGION functions:
       
          @rsum, @ravg, @rprod, @rmax, @rmin, @rstddev

       These functions, prefixed with an `r, work almost exactly like their
       RANGE counterparts:

          @sum, @avg, @prod, @max, @min, @stddev

       except that there is a profound difference: CELLS THAT USE THESE
       FUNCTIONS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO TRANSFORM PROPERLY UNDER INSERTION
       AND DELETION OF ROWS AND COLUMNS.  

       There is a simple relationship between the two sets of functions,
       e.g.,

           @sum (A10:F20) ==  @rsum (A10:G21)
	   @sum (B15:B27) ==  @rsum (B15:B28)
	   
       That is, the @rXXX functions are equivalent to the @XXX ones except
       that the cells that define the endpoints of the region are not
       used by the function.  
       
       This is consistent with the underlying text editor analogy of the
       interface: objects in a region are those from the mark UP TO BUT NOT
       INCLUDING the point.

Changes since 0.1 of SLSC

   1.  VMS style help now case insensitive and accepts abbreviations.
   2.  format statement now accepts the extra parameter of later sc versions.
   3.  Some items left out of the menus have been put in.
   4.  Better emacs emulation (Ctrl-SPACE sets mark, ESC-W copies region, ...)
   5.  Bug in menu that caused core dump fixed.
