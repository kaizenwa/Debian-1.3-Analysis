vprint.c is the C source to a print filter that permits one to print a file
with very long lines by continuing a long line onto another page.   It has
been written specifically to print a spreadsheet.

Currently, vprint provides built-in support for the HPdeskjet printers in
Landscape mode.  However, it may be used with any other printer by
specifying the number of rows and colums.

To compile vprint.c, simply type `make vprint'.  

Put something like:

   set printer "| /usr/local/lib/slsc/vprint -deskjet | lpr"

in the slsc.rc file.   If you do not have deskjet printer, use something
like: 

   set printer "| /usr/local/lib/slsc/vprint 50x80 | lpr"
   
where the assumption has been made that the printer has 50 rows and 80
columns.
