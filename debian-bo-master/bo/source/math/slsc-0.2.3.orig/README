The installation instructions are below.

This is a much modified version of the public domain spread sheet sc, posted
several years ago by Mark Weiser as vc, originally by James Gosling. The
version that I have is based on Robert Bond's sc 6.1.  The latest version of
sc is 6.21.  

  Note:
  
   Spreadsheet files generated by 6.21 may not entirely compatable with
   with 6.1.  If you see any `syntax' errors when loading a spreadsheet,
   please email me the line causing the error so that this can be fixed.
   SLSC displays the line number at the top when it encounters an error.

I cannot possibly list all of the changes that I have made to the program.
It is my guess that the size of the diffs are greater than the source itself.
Previously, sc relied on curses for screen management.  There were comments
in the code suggesting that curses is buggy.  Whether it is or not, I did
away with curses and incorporated S-Lang's screen management routines.  In
addition, I am using S-Lang's ability to handle keymaps, readline, help
routines etc...  For these reason's I have changed the name to `slsc'.   The
upshot is that it is a new program with a new name, and a new look and feel.

Please note that there is no man page for slsc yet.  sc.doc is the man page
for the version of sc that slsc is based on.

Installation Instructions:

0. There is NO install target in the makefile yet.  It is trivial enough to
   do it by hand.

1. Build S-Lang first.  You should have received a copy of S-Lang with this
   program.
   
2. Edit the `makefile' that is in the `src' directory.
   In particular,  you will need to specify the location of SLSC_ROOT.  The
   online help file as well as the system keymap file will be kept in
   SLSC_ROOT.  I suggest using /usr/local/lib/slsc.
   
3. Create the SLSC_ROOT directory and give it the proper permissions, e.g.,

     % mkdir /usr/local/lib/slsc
     % chmod go+rx /usr/local/lib/slsc
   
3. Type `make'.  If you edited the makefile ok, you will find `slsc' when
   make is done.
   
4. Copy `slsc.hlp' and `slsc.rc' to SLSC_ROOT.

5. Test it:  type:

       % ./slsc tutorial.sc
       
   If you have a color terminal, use:
   
       %  ./slsc -C tutorial.sc
       
   [`tutorial.sc' has not been updated for slsc.  It does illustrate how
     slsc uses colors.]
   
   Hopefully, it will work.  Read the online help for usage.  Note that if
   you want to use the slsc's print command, you will have to edit slsc.rc
   to configure the printer.  See also vprint.txt for more discussion on
   this point.
   
6. If you want to change the keybindings, copy `slsc.rc' from SLSC_ROOT to
   your home directory and rename it to `.slscrc'.  Edit it.
   
   When slsc starts up, it loads SLSC_ROOT/slsc.rc.  Then, if $HOME/.slscrc
   exists it loads it.  Thus, the initialization file in SLSC_ROOT applies
   to all users.
   
   Good luck.  
   Please email suggested improvements to davis@amy.tch.harvard.edu.
