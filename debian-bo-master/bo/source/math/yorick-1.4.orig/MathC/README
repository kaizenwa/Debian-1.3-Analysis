This directory contains a set of more advanced mathematical functions
for Yorick:

All were obtained from netlib@ornl.gov.

(1) FFT (Swarztrauber's routines).

(2) Tridiagonal solver.

(3) LU decomposition (by Gaussian elimination) matrix solver

(4) QR decomposition matrix solver

(5) SVD matrix solver and analyzer

The FFT routines are from fftpack.  The matrix routines are from lapack,
and require some blas routines.  The files fft.i and matrix.i describe
the interpreted interface; see also Yorick/doc/math.doc.

The original Fortran source was converted to C using my f2c.el Emacs
functions (Emacs 19.25, but should work with others) and a few by-hand
fixes afterwards.  The "by hand fixes" included several typographical
bugs introduced by f2c.el --- so beware.

This Yorick package is an example of how to add compiled C routines to
the Yorick interpreter.  You can also read the Yorick/codger.c source
code for hints.  The Drat package is a more sophistocated example, in
which there are significant compiled interface routines.
