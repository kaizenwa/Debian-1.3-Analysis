\title{Appendix B : A sample Makefile}

We assume that you have installed the PARI library and include files
as explained in Appendix A or in the installation guide. If you chose
differently any of the directory names, please change them accordingly
in the Makefiles.

If the program example that we have given is in the file mattrans.c
(say as the first of several matrix transcendental functions), then
a sample Makefile is the following:

{\tt \obeylines\parskip=0pt plus 1pt
\hbox{}
CC = cc
CFLAGS = -O -I/usr/include/pari-include -DULONG\_NOT\_DEFINED -DLONG\_IS\_32BIT
\hbox{}
all:\qquad mattrans
\hbox{}
mattrans:\qquad	mattrans.c
\qquad	\$(CC) \$(CFLAGS) -o mattrans mattrans.c -lpari -lm
}
