.SH NAME
spline \- Akima spline interpolation

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spline
.RI "[-a " xstep "]"
.RI "[-l " llimit "]"
.RI "[-u " ulimit "]"
.RI "[-n " n "]"
.RI "[" file "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I spline
reads pairs of numbers from
.I file
(or from standard input if no file was given) as abscissas and ordinates
of a function.
It produces a similar set, which is approximately equally spaced and
includes the input set on standard output. The output is an
.IR Akima -interpolated
spline which has an continuous first derivative.
The second derivate may be discontinuous, but the output does not wiggle
as it would do with cubic splines.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-a \fIincr\fP" ", " "\-\-auto=\fIincr\fP"
supply abscissas automatically, since they are missing from the input;
spacing is given by the next argument, or is assumed to be 1,
if next argument is not a number.
.TP
.BR "\-h" ", " "\-\-help"
display help message and exit,
.TP
.BR "\-l \fIllimit\fP" ", " "\-\-llimit=\fIllimit\fP"
set lower x-limit to
.IR llimit ,
.TP
.BR "\-u \fIulimit\fP" ", " "\-\-ulimit=\fIulimit\fP"
set upper x-limit to
.IR ulimit ,
.TP
.BR "\-n \fIn\fP" ", " "\-\-points=\fIn\fP"
space output points so that approx.
.I n
intervals occur between the lower and upper limit,
.TP
.B "\-\-warranty"
display licensing terms
.TP
.B "\-\-version"
display version information and exit.

If you need a continuous second derivative, you can't use this version
of
.IR spline .
