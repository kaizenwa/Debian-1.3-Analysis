1. The hidden line algorithm is not perfect.  The back of the object
can bleed through to the front.  We should put in a option of not
drawing the back at all.

2. The list of available devices is often longer than the length of
a screen.  This output should be sent through a pager.

3. In the Atari version, windows are not currently supported.  This
means gnuplot 3.4 will not run with MultiAES.  We hope to correct
this shortly in gpcontrb.tar.z.
