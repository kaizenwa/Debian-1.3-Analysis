## usage:  X = loadaudio (name [, ext [, bit]])
##
## Loads audio data from the file "name.ext" into the data vector X.
## Default value for the "ext" argument, which has to be written
## without the initial ".", is "lin".
## Currently, the following audio formats are supported:
## *) mu-law encoding with extension "mu", "au" or "snd"
## *) linear encoding with extension "lin" or "raw"
##
## The `bit' argument can be either 8 (default) or 16.
## Depending on the value of bit, linearly encoded files are
## interpreted as being in 8 and 16 bit format, respectively, and
## mu-law encoded files are transformed to 8 and 16-bit linear
## format, respectively.
