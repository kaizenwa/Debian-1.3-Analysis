## usage: [xx, yy] = meshgrid (x, y)
##
## Given vectors of x and y coordinates, return two matrices corresponding
## to the x and y coordinates of a mesh.  The rows of xx are copies of x,
## and the columns of yy are copies of y.
##
## [xx, yy] = meshgrid (x) is an abbreviation for [xx, yy] = meshgrid (x, x).
##
## See sombrero.m for an example of using meshgrid.
