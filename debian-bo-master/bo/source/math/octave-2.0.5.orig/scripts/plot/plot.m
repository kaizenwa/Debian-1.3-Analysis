## usage: plot (x, y)
##        plot (x1, y1, x2, y2, ...)
##        plot (x, y, fmt)
##
## If the first argument is a vector and the second is a matrix, the
## the vector is plotted versus the columns (or rows) of the matrix.
## (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)
##
## If the first argument is a matrix and the second is a vector, the
## the columns (or rows) of the matrix are plotted versus the vector.
## (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)
##
## If both arguments are vectors, the elements of y are plotted versus
## the elements of x.
##
## If both arguments are matrices, the columns of y are plotted versus
## the columns of x.  In this case, both matrices must have the same
## number of rows and columns and no attempt is made to transpose the
## arguments to make the number of rows match.
##
## If both arguments are scalars, a single point is plotted.
##
## If only one argument is given, it is taken as the set of y
## coordinates and the x coordinates are taken to be the indices of the
## elements, starting with 1.
##
## To see possible options for FMT please see __pltopt__.
##
## Examples:
##
##   plot (x, y, "@12", x, y2, x, y3, "4", x, y4, "+")
##
##     y will be plotted with points of type 2 ("+") and color 1 (red).
##     y2 will be plotted with lines.
##     y3 will be plotted with lines of color 4.
##     y4 will be plotted with points which are "+"s.
##
##   plot (b, "*")
##
##     b will be plotted with points of type "*".
