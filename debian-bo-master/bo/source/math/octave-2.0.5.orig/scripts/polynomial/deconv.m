## usage: deconv (y, a)
##
## Deconvolve two vectors.
##
## [b, r] = deconv (y, a) solves for b and r such that
##    y = conv(a,b) + r
##
## If y and a are polynomial coefficient vectors, b will contain the
## coefficients of the polynomial quotient and r will be a remander
## polynomial of lowest order.
