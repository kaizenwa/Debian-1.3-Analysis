## usage: [BETA, SIGMA [, R]] = ols (Y, X)
##
## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation for the multivariate model
##
##     Y = X*B + E,  mean(E) = 0,  cov(vec(E)) = kron(S,I)
##
## with Y ... T x p     As usual, each row of Y and X is an observation
##      X ... T x k     and each column a variable.
##      B ... k x p
##      E ... T x p.
##
## BETA is the OLS estimator for B, i.e.
##
##   BETA = pinv(X)*Y,
##
## where pinv(X) denotes the pseudoinverse of X.
## SIGMA is the OLS estimator for the matrix S, i.e.
##
##   SIGMA = (Y - X*BETA)'*(Y - X*BETA) / (T - rank(X)).
##
## R = Y - X*BETA is the matrix of OLS residuals.
