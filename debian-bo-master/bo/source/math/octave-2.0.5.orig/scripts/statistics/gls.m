##
## Generalized Least Squares (GLS) estimation for the multivariate model
##
##   Y = X*B + E,  mean(E) = 0,  cov(vec(E)) = (s^2)*O
##
## with Y ...  T x p      As usual, each row of Y and X is an observation
##      X ...  T x k      and each column a variable.
##      B ...  k x p
##      E ...  T x p
##      O ... Tp x Tp.
##
## BETA is the GLS estimator for B.
## v is the GLS estimator for s^2.
## R = Y - X*BETA is the matrix of GLS residuals.
