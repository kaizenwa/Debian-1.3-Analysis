## Set the current colormap.
##
## colormap (map) sets the current colormap to map.  map should be an n
## row by 3 column matrix. The columns contain red, green, and blue
## intensities respectively.  All entries should be between 0 and 1
## inclusive. The new colormap is returned.
##
## colormap ("default") restores the default colormap (a gray scale
## colormap with 64 entries). The default colormap is returned.
##
## colormap with no arguments returns the current colormap.
