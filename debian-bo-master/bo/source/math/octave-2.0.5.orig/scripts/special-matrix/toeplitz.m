## usage: toeplitz (c, r)
##
## Return the Toeplitz matrix constructed given the first column
## c, and (optionally) the first row r.
##
## If the second argument is omitted, the first row is taken to be the
## same as the first column.  If the first element of c is not the same
## as the first element of r, the first element of c is used.
