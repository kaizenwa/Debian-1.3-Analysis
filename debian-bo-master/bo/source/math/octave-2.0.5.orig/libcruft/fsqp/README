Subject: FSQP 3.0 2/12: README

The FSQP distribution consists of the following files:
  COPYRIGHT
  README (this file)
  Version*
  fsqpd.f
  macros.tex
  manual.sty
  manual.tex
  manua2.tex
  qld.f
  sampl1.f
  sampl2.f
  sampl3.f
We suggest that you keep all these files in a dedicated subdirectory.

All the FSQP routines are in fsqpd.f.  FSQP requires a quadratic 
program solver.  As distributed,  it calls QLD (written by 
Klaus Schittkowski, provided in file qld.f for the user's convenience).  
Three sample test problems are given in sampl1.f, sampl2.f and sampl3.f. 
Thus, for example, to run sample1.f one should use the following 
compiling sequence on a UNIX-based system

        f77  sampl1.f fsqpd.f qld.f

The results obtained should be compared with those given in the 
User's Guide.

The User's Guide is provided in latex format (files manual.tex,
manua2.tex, macros.tex and manual.sty).  It provides detailed information 
concerning FSQP and its use.  Simply type

              latex manual.tex

with files manua2.tex, manual.sty and macros.tex present 
in the same directory.

Finally, the file Versionx.x lists the enhancements in the
successive versions of FSQP.

Please send us your comments.  Any feedback is highly appreciated.
