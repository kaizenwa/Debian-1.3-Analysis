@This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of rpncalc, a rpn calculator.
This package was put together by David Frey <David.Frey@@eos.lugs.ch>,
from local sources.

Changes:
 * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
 * renamed calc (original package name) into rpncalc to avoid possible
   confusion with the better known emacs calc package.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The function table lookup via the qsort/bsearch mechanism was described in 
iX 11/95 p204ff, code fragments have been taken from there with kind 
permission of Juergen Seeger (chief editor).

The getline function has been modelled after the one described in the
_Bison Manual_ by Charles Donelly and Richard Stallmann.

The command completion is modelled after the one described in fileman.c,
an example program delivered with readline, and parts of the code were
taken from this example.
