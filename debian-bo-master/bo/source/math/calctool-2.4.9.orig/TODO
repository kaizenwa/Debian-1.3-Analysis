Bugs:

1/ The following problems exist for the NeWS v1.1 version:

   a) The calctool icon (color and mono) is not being displayed correctly.

   b) The initial position of the icon should be settable via the
      -WP flag.

   c) It should be possible for calctool to start iconically.

   d) Popup menu support needs to be fully implemented.


2/ The following problems exist with the mgr version:

   a) The fonts aren't being loaded correctly.

   b) After a reshape, the "panel items" are not being redisplayed.

   c) The right button popup menu support is not correctly working.


3/ The following problems exist with the XView version:

   a) The memory register window is coming up in the wrong place.
      This is because of bug 1022495 (xview/library).
 
   b) The DEL (.) key on the right hand keypad generates ASCII 127
      which is the same as the Delete key.


4/ The following problems exist with the X11 version.

   a) The size of the calctool icon on the monochrome version is incorrect.

   b) The right mouse button currently does not bring up a popup menu.


Enhancements:

1/ Incorporate a multi-precision arithmetic package as the basis of all
   calculations. The display could then include two little arrow icons,
   one at each side of the numeric display, which would shift the contents
   to the left or the right.

2/ Add some more functions. Some suggested functions are:

  a) Common antilogarithm and natural antilogarithm.

  b) Cube root key.

  c) Root key. The y root of x.

  d) Rectangular to polar and polar to rectangular keys.

  e) Random number key. Return a random number between 0.0 and < 1.0.

3/ Add Reverse Polish notation.

4/ Support multiple graphics version in the same binary or write a front-end
   shell script that with select the appropriate binary depending on the
   environment [MGR/NeWS/SunView/tty/X11] [Sun3/Sun4/Sun386i] etc..

5/ See if it's possible to get the GET and PUT function keys working with
   the NeWS and the X11 versions.

6/ Include an engineering mode.
