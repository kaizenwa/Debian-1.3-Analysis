This is the distribution of the UMSDOS file system utilities.
There is two directories.

linux: contain administration tool for umsdos and man page.

tests: Contain regression tests for both umsdos and msdos file system

To build this distribution, do

	(All this is written in C++ and compile with G++ 2.6.2
	 It does not use libg++ though)

	make all

To install (this will put few programs in /sbin)

	make install

To clean object files

	make clean

To test umsdos, here is the sequence I do.

	cd tests
	# mount0 assume that drive F: is your floppy B:
	# I use this trick to do mformat
	make mount0
	utstgen all
	umount /mnt
	utstspc all

To learn about umsdos (internal) get the file umsdos-x.y-doc.gz
from sunsite.unc.edu in pub/Linux/ALPHA/umsdos. See also
the README in /usr/src/linux/fs/umsdos.
