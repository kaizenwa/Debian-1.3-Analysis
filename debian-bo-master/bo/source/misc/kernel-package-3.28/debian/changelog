kernel-package (3.28) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer install text files in the modules directory, since depmod
    in modutils-2.1.34 fails when it finds a non-ELF file in modules
    directory. This fixes Bug#9243.

kernel-package (3.27) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Really add in all the changes sent in by Herbert Xu. The changes are: 
    * Changed to source package name back to kernel-source-=V again. 
    * Changed the install's to be without -o root -g root since it is no
      longer useful as the chown's are done before the packages are built. It
      also means that if it is used in targets like stamp-configure which may
      be run by anyone it won't not generate an error.
    * Made rules file generate the control file.
    * Fixed some typos in chowns commands while generating the header
      packages. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Apr 1997 15:12:19 -0500

kernel-package (3.26) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the default image for ppc architecture zImage. This fixes Bug#8696 .
  * Forgot to mention that the source package for the kernel packages
    (produced by make-kpkg buildpackage, for example) has been changed to
    not contain the kernel version as part of the name (all the deb files
    produced have not changed), so we now get kernel-image-xxx_yy_zz.deb,
    kernel-source-xxx_yy_zz.deb, and kernel-headers-xxx_yy_zz.deb, along
    with kernel-source.tar.gz and kernel-source_yy.diff.gz
  * Added config dependencies for module targets

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Apr 1997 00:53:24 -0500

kernel-package (3.25) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added changes sent in by the kernel packages maintainer.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Apr 1997 00:03:36 -0500

kernel-package (3.24) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed a bash 2.0 inconsistency

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 9 Apr 1997 13:33:58 -0500

kernel-package (3.23) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed typos in rules for generating external modules

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 9 Apr 1997 12:41:45 -0500

kernel-package (3.22) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Documented constraints on the debian revision field. This is important
     enough that I am reproducing the text of the admonition here.
     The revision number (the argument supplied after the --revision flag)
     has certain constraints: it may contain only alphanumerics and the
     characters + . (full stop, and plus) and should contain a digit.
     NOTE: No hyphens allowed. (Look at Chapter 5 of the Programmers manual
     for details)

     This is because dpkg imposes an ordering on version numbers, so that
     it can tell whether packages are being up or downgraded and so that
     dselect can tell whether a package it finds available is newer than
     the one installed on the system.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 4 Apr 1997 11:48:42 -0600

kernel-package (3.21) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Tested source package creation for 2.1.30
  * set umask to copy the kernel source files untainted by package creators
    umask. 
  * set umask to copy the kernel header files untainted by package creators
    umask. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 1 Apr 1997 11:04:42 -0600

kernel-package (3.20) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Could not reproduce BUG#8274, neither could the original reporter. I have
    made some changes in the postinst to allow leading whitespace in the
    user responses, and tested it on three different kernel-source
    versions.  I believe this bug is fixed now (I have 3 suitable boot
    floppies as evidence). 
  * image postinst no longer aborts when the user gives up on formatting a
    floppy, but now offers a choice to proceed with a preformatted floppy. 
  * Fixed spelling errors in kernel image postinst, fixing BUG#8409
  * Offer to user superformat if it exists.
  * Tested boot floppy creation.
  * Tested on 2.0.29, 2.1.29, and 2.1.30
  * Spell check the Problems file, mention setfdprm in there.
  * Mention setfdprm in postinst if fail to format floppy.
  * Fix a typo in code determining which floppy drive to use
  * Allow leading whitespace in responses
  * Added required packages to the README file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Mar 1997 22:53:13 -0600

kernel-package (3.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tested again on 2.1.27 kernel.
  * Added correct Handling for ipv6 modules in rules file

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 1 Mar 1997 13:52:15 -0600

kernel-package (3.18) unstable; urgency=high

  * Succesfully compiled a 2.1.27 kernel.
  * Made make-kpkg not look for modules directoryi; that directory is
    removed by a make-kpkg clean.
  * Mentioned that ncurses-dev is required for make menuconfig in the
    README file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Feb 1997 23:36:30 -0600

kernel-package (3.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stupid @#$%$%@! vi changed Feb to February in the changelog messing up
    gencontrol. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Feb 1997 19:29:02 -0600

kernel-package (3.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Started compiling a list of known problems with compiling kernel images.
    This is now available as /usr/doc/kernel-package/Problems.
  * Moved to standards version 2.1.2.2.
  * Removed extra root checks in the rules file.
  * Added error messages to failed root check in the rules file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Feb 1997 14:40:41 -0600

kernel-package (3.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed kernel rules file so that one does not depend on the existence of 
    modules. This fixes BUG#6898.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Jan 1997 22:15:27 -0600

kernel-package (3.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made image.postinst conform to standards version 2.1.2.2.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jan 1997 09:09:37 -0600

kernel-package (3.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Silly typo in postinst (never code when sleepy).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jan 1997 00:56:48 -0600

kernel-package (3.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added more injunction to run make-kpkg clean regularly
  * Remove /lib/modules/$version/modules.dep if it exists.  Recreate 
    immediately with depmod -a.  This will help reinstall the same kernel
    version more than once.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jan 1997 00:38:59 -0600

kernel-package (3.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added suggestions for fdutils and LILO for the kernel_image package.
  * Fixed typo in include.postinst.  Fixes BUG#6692.
  * Added warnings about possible (recent?) failure to autodetect floppy
    drives if using old fdformat from miscutils while creating a boot disk.
    This addresses BUG#6037.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Jan 1997 12:03:31 -0600

kernel-package (3.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * *ALERT*.  Changed how customization variables are handled. All
    variables are given reasonable (IMHO) defaults.  Then the site
    customization file /etc/kernel-pkg.conf is read in, which can
    over-ride the defaults. THEN, the environment/command line variables
    are used to over-ride the values.
  * New env variables: KPKG_MAINTAINER, KPKG_EMAIL, IMAGE_IN_BOOT,
    IMAGE_TYPE 
  * new customization variables: kimage, image_in_boot
  * Edited README to give bare bones documentation for user customizable
    vars. 
  * Added man page kernel-pkg.conf.5.
  * Normalized existing man pages according to the templates floating
    around on the list.
  * Added copyright statements to the man pages.
  * Documented changes in make-kpkg
  * Added --bzimage option to make-kpkg for completeness.
  * Added a --zimage option to make-kpkg, (with support in the rules file),
    to make a zImage kernel rather than a bzImage kernel (the default). 
    Useful for people having problems with bzImage kernels. Suggested by 
    Richard G. Roberto <richr@Bear.COM>
 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 7 Jan 1997 12:44:00 -0600

kernel-package (3.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added documentation to the effect that make-kpkg is part of
    kernel-package in various README's. 
  * Made the final location of vmlinuz configurable (since one may have
    it under /boot as well as /).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 2 Jan 1997 11:27:06 -0600

kernel-package (3.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a man page for internal script kernel-packageconfig.  This fixes
    BUG#6304.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 1 Jan 1997 22:02:03 -0600

kernel-package (3.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in kernel image postinst script

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Dec 1996 23:40:31 -0600

kernel-package (3.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow local configuration of the destination of all kernel related
    deb file (the default remains ..).  Now one can set it to directories
    like ../kernel-deb or /boot/archive/deb or whatever by setting the
    variable DEB_DEST in the conf file.
  * Offer user a choice about floppy drive to use. Also make it explicit
    which floppy drive is being used. This fixes BUG#6037.
  * Warn intel users that they should get bin86 as well, if they intend
    to compile a custom kernel.  This fixes BUG#6144.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Dec 1996 18:09:51 -0600

kernel-package (3.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * The package needs dpkg-gencontrol to do any work whatsoever, so it
    should depend on dpkg-dev, instead of merely recommending it.  
    This fixes BUG#6040.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Dec 1996 01:54:01 -0600

kernel-package (3.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dpkg (>= 1.4) to the dependencies, since older versions do
    not understand the new dpkg --build syntax.  This fixes BUG#6041
  * Fixed target modules config in kernel/rules. This fixes BUG#5836
  * Latest default kernel config file

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Nov 1996 15:11:12 -0600

kernel-package (3.03) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * changed priority of kernel-source package to optional
  * changed priority of kernel-image package to optional
  * Recommended dpkg-dev since kernel/rules call binaries from there
    This fixes a problem that a number of people have reported on the
    lists, though it never made it as a formal bug report.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Nov 1996 11:02:31 -0600

kernel-package (3.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * kernel-source-X.XX now no longer recommends bin86, since bin86 is only
    available intel platforms.  It now merely mentions it in the
    description. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 7 Nov 1996 22:18:15 -0600

kernel-package (3.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed one last typo in postinst. This (finally) fixes Bug#4234. 
  * Also, version 3.00 fixed Bug#4500 and Bug#4624
  * kernel-source-X.XX now recommends bin86, which fixes Bug#4443
  * Added short, succint (and potentially dangerous) instructions on
    compiling kernels at the top of the README file.  This fixes Bug#4445.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@datasync.com>  Wed, 6 Nov 1996 23:58:35 -0600

kernel-package (3.00) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed the kernel-package to the new packaging schemes.
  * Removed the dist, source, and diff targets for make-kpkg, added
    binary-arch, binary-indep, and buildpackage targets.
  * Changed make-kpkg to reflect reorganization of the
    /usr/lib/kernel-package/ tree.
  * Changed Authour email.
  * Removed dithering about ./debian/* in kernel sources, now make-kpkg
    looks only at /usr/lib/kernel-package/ (clears confusion about older
    versions of kernel-package).
  * Modified make-kpkg.8 to reflect changes in make-kpkg, and ran a spell
    check. 
  * Renamed debian/package.config to kernel-packageconfig, and removed
    (obsolete) references to dchanges)
  * Moved *.README to copyright.*, and changed the rules files to
    conform. 
  * Added explanation for kernel-headers-X.XX (and why we need this
    package inspite of having headers in libc5-dev)
  
 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@datasync.com>  Mon, 4 Nov 1996 16:19:33 -0600

kernel-package (2.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in make-kpkg man pages where it insisted that it was
    make-dpkg ;-) 
  * Made the close brackets agree with open brackets in the man page
    synopsis.   This fixes Bug#3960

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  

kernel-package (2.02) unstable; low

  * Made image.postinst more polite.
  * Also enabled kernel-{source,image,headers} targets in kernel.rules 
  * Changed make-kpkg to also accept the new targets.
  * Fixed typo in man page.
  * The man page says it is an adminstrators man page rather than a 
    programmers man page.
  * Recommended libc-dev for kernel-source and kernel-package
  * source suggests ncurses3.0-dev, tk40-dev and the description explains 
    you could use make menuconfig rather than plain old make config if you
    had these packages.
  * Fixed typo in the rules for modules in /usr/src/modules/ directory
  * Made the rules for such modules ignore errors (since they are not
    really a part of this package, error there should not halt this build
    (or so people seem to want it)
  * Look for modules in the kernel config file (or the default config file
    if the user has not supplied a config file), and only make modules and
    install them if modules have been configured in the config file. This 
    could be tested better.
  * Fixed the make-kpkg.8 man page so that it now does not seem to mandate
    a source and diff file for additional modules installed under the 
    directory /usr/src/modules/ (whether these files are produced is at
    the discretion of the maintainer of that modules package.
  * Make configure depend on stamp-configure which in turn depends on
    .config Hopefully, this will remake the image atrget if one changes
    the config file Hopefully, this will not cause the image target to
    build needlessly. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  

kernel-package (2.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the scripts to refer to /usr/bin/perl rather than /bin/perl.
  * Added an extended description to the image control file.
  * Added a note that the dist target requires a PGP key.
  * Fixed a typo (missing DEBDIR) in debian.rules.
  * Fixed the targets expected by make-kpkg (kernel_image rather than 
    kernel-image, etc).
  * In image.postinst, made arguments to system be a single argument if  
    the arguments contain shell metacharacters, (this way perl passes
    them to sh -c).
  * Made make-kpkg accept non floats as revision numbers, to facilitate  
    local names.
  * Fixed silly bug in makefloppy in image.postinst.
  * Fixed the extended description of the kernel-package package.
  * Updated the image postinst to install the mbr, if it exists, and to
    activate the root partition, and to not overwrite the mbr (oops).
  * Changed maintainer email address to debian.org (I'll be in a state of  
    flux soon)
