kernel-source-=V (=D) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer install text files in the modules directory, since depmod
    in modutils-2.1.34 fails when it finds a non-ELF file in modules
    directory. This fixes Bug#9243.

kernel-source-0.13 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really add in all the changes sent in by Herbert Xu. The changes are: 
    * Changed to source package name back to kernel-source-=V again. 
    * Changed the install's to be without -o root -g root since it is no
      longer useful as the chown's are done before the packages are built. It
      also means that if it is used in targets like stamp-configure which may
      be run by anyone it won't not generate an error.
    * Made rules file generate the control file.
    * Fixed some typos in chowns commands while generating the header
      packages.

 kernel-source-0.12 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Forgot to mention that the source package for the kernel packages 
    (produced by make-kpkg buildpackage, for example) has been changed to 
    not contain the kernel version as part of the name (all the deb files 
    produced have not changed), so we now get kernel-image-xxx_yy_zz.deb, 
    kernel-source-xxx_yy_zz.deb, and kernel-headers-xxx_yy_zz.deb, along
    with kernel-source.tar.gz and kernel-source_yy.diff.gz
  * Added changes from the kernel packages maintainer (this is the
    kernel-packages maintainer speaking, Herbert Xu handles the kernel
    image, headers, and source packages at the moment).

 kernel-source-0.11 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * set umask to copy the kernel source files untainted by package creators
    umask. 
  * set umask to copy the kernel header files untainted by package creators
    umask.

 kernel-source-0.10 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * image postinst no longer aborts when the user gives up on formatting a
    floppy, but is offered a choice to proceed with a preformatted floppy. 
  * Fixed spelling errors in kernel image postinst
  * Offer to user superformat if it exists.
  * Tested boot floppy creation.
  * Tested on 2.0.29, 2.1.29, and 2.1.30
  * Mention setfdprm in postinst if fail to format floppy.
  * Fix a typo in code determining which floppy drive to use
  * Allow leading whitespace in responses

kernel-source-0.9 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  n Stupid @#$%$%@! vi changed Feb to February in the changelog messing up
    gencontrol. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Feb 1997 19:29:02 -0600

kernel-source-0.8 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed extra root checks
  * Added error messages to failed root check
 
 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org> Thursday, 13 February 1997 14:47:06 -0600

kernel-source-0.7 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed kernel rules file so that one does not depend on the existence of modules

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tuesday, 28 January 1997 22:15:27 -0600

kernel-source-0.6 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed priority of kernel-source package to optional
  * changed priority of kernel-image package to optional

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Nov 1996 11:02:31 -0600


kernel-source-0.5 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * kernel-source-X.XX now no longer recommends bin86, since bin86 is only
    available intel platforms.  It now merely mentions it in the
    description.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 7 Nov 1996 22:17:47 -0600

kernel-source-0.4 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * kernel-source-X.XX now recommends bin86, which fixes Bug#4443
  * Added short, succint (and potentially dangerous) instructions on
    compiling kernels at the top of the README file.  This fixes Bug#4445.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 6 Nov 1996 23:59:47 -0600

kernel-source-0.3 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed everything to new packaging standards.
  * Major re-organization.
  * Added explanation for kernel-headers-X.XX (and why we need this
    package inspite of having headers in libc5-dev)
  * Added README files for all packages (the old README files became
    copyright files).
  * Added target for buildpackage (wich needed a hack in the target clean
    so as not to remove the ./debian directory prematurely)

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 5 Nov 1996 22:42:12 -0600

kernel-source-0.2 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made image.postinst more polite.
  * Also enabled kernel-{source,image,headers} targets in kernel.rules 
  * Changed make-kpkg to also accept the new targets.
  * Fixed typo in man page.
  * The man page says it is an adminstrators man page rather than a 
    programmers man page.
  * Recommended libc-dev for kernel-source and kernel-package
  * source suggests ncurses3.0-dev, tk40-dev and the description explains 
    you could use make menuconfig rather than plain old make config if you
    had these packages.
  * Fixed typo in the rules for modules in /usr/src/modules/ directory
  * Made the rules for such modules ignore errors (since they are not
    really a part of this package, error there should not halt this build
    (or so people seem to want it)
  * Look for modules in the kernel config file (or the default config file
    if the user has not supplied a config file), and only make modules and
    install them if modules have been configured in the config file. This 
    could be tested better.
  * Fixed the make-kpkg.8 man page so that it now does not seem to mandate
    a source and diff file for additional modules installed under the 
    directory /usr/src/modules/ (whether these files are produced is at
    the discretion of the maintainer of that modules package.
  * Make configure depend on stamp-configure which in turn depends on
    .config Hopefully, this will remake the image atrget if one changes
    the config file Hopefully, this will not cause the image target to
    build needlessly. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  

kernel-source-0.1 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the scripts to refer to /usr/bin/perl rather than /bin/perl.
  * Added an extended description to the image control file.
  * Added a note that the dist target requires a PGP key.
  * Fixed a typo (missing DEBDIR) in debian.rules.
  * Fixed the targets expected by make-kpkg (kernel_image rather than 
    kernel-image, etc).
  * In image.postinst, made arguments to system be a single argument if  
    the arguments contain shell metacharacters, (this way perl passes
    them to sh -c).
  * Made make-kpkg accept non floats as revision numbers, to facilitate  
    local names.
  * Fixed silly bug in makefloppy in image.postinst.
  * Fixed the extended description of the kernel-package package.
  * Updated the image postinst to install the mbr, if it exists, and to
    activate the root partition, and to not overwrite the mbr (oops).
  * Changed maintainer email address to debian.org (I'll be in a state of  
    flux soon)
