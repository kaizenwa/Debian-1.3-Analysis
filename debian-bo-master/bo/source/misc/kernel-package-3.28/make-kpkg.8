.TH MAKE\-KPKG 8 "Jan 7 1997" "Debian" "Debian GNU/Linux manual"
.SH NAME
make\-kpkg \- build Debian kernel packages from Linux kernel sources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B make\-kpkg
.I [options]
\&[target [target ...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page explains the Debian
.B "make\-kpkg"
utility, which is used to create the kernel related 
Debian 
packages. This utility needs to be run from a top level 
Linux
kernel source directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.B \-\-help
Print out a usage message.
.TP
.BR \-\-revision " number"
Sets the Debian revision number for the packages produced to the argument
.BR number.
This has certain constraints: it may contain only
alphanumerics and the characters + . (full stop, and plus) and must
contain a digit.
.BR  NOTE:
No hyphens allowed. (Look at Chapter 5 of the Programmers manual for details)
.TP
.BR \-\-pgpsign " name"
Set the string used to sign the 
.B changes 
file for any external modules in 
.IR /usr/src/modules/
using PGP. This option will override the builtin default and the site
wide customizations stored in the file 
.IR /etc/kernel-pkg.conf.
.TP
.B \-\-targets
Prints out a list of known targets. See the Section
.B Targets 
below.
.TP
.B \-\-noexec
Pass a 
.B \-n
option to the 
.I make
process so that commands are merely printed to the screen but not actually
executed. This is very useful for debugging.
.TP
.B \-\-zimage
Makes a zImage kernel rather than a bzImage kernel (the default).
Useful for people having problems with bzImage kernels. 
.TP
.B \-\-bzimage
Makes a bzImage kernel. Useful for people who want a bzImage kernel on
sites where the default is zImage kernels. 
.PP
The options maybe shortened to the smallest unique string, and may
be entered with either a \- or a \-\- prefix, and you may use a space
or an = symbol between an option string and a value.
.SH TARGETS
.TP
.B clean
Cleans the kernel source directory of all files created by target
.B build,
and runs a make distclean. (Please look at a Linux kernel Makefile for 
details).
Please note that although we take care of the list of current kernel 
configuration contained in the file
.I .config,
the file 
.I include/linux/autoconf.h
is not preserved.
.TP
.B buildpackage
This target runs the targets 
.B clean, 
and
.B binary,
and produces the complete package using 
.B dpkg-buildpackage
.TP
.B binary
This target produces all three 
Debian
kernel packages by running the targets
.B kernel_source, kernel_headers
and
.B kernel_image.
.TP
.B kernel_source
This target produces a debianised package of the 
Linux
kernel sources. The package produced also has scripts called at install 
and delete times that manage the symbolic link
.I /usr/src/linux
and ensure that the link is pointed at the latest source/header package on
the system.
.TP
.B kernel_headers
This target produces a 
Debian
package containing the header files included in the 
Linux
kernel. The package produced also has scripts called at install 
and delete times that manage the symbolic link
.I /usr/src/linux
and ensure that the link is pointed at the latest source/header package on
the system.
.TP
.B kernel_image
This target produces a 
Debian
package of the 
Linux
kernel source image, and any modules configured in the kernel configuration
file
.I .config.
If there is no 
.I .config
file in the kernel source directory, a default configuration is provided
similar to the one used to create the 
.B Debian
boot\-floppies.  The package produced updates the 
.I /boot/psdatabase
file at install time, it also update symbolic links in the root directory
to point to the new kernel image in
.I /boot.
It also offers to run the 
Linux
loader, 
.I LILO,
creating a configuration file for 
.I LILO
if needed.  It also offers to put the new kernel on a floppy, formatting 
the floppy if needed.  On deletion, the package checks the version of
the kernel running, and refuses to delete a running kernel.
.TP
.B build
This target, used by target
.B kernel_image
above, compiles the 
Linux
kernel image.
.TP
.B modules
This target allows you to build all add-on modules and packages that are
very dependent on the precise kernel version they are compiled for at the
same time you build your kernel image.  This target expects to find the 
modules or packages under /usr/src/modules, and, for all such directories,
changes to /usr/src/modules/x, and runs the 
.B kdist
rule in the local 
.I debian.rules
file. This target should create the 
.B Debian
module package(s), and may also produce a compressed tar file, and a
compressed diff file, with
.I md5sums
recorded in a changes file using
.B dpkg-genchanges.
The file is signed by the same identity that would be used to sign the
kernel packages.
.TP
.B modules_config
This target allows you to configure all packages under
.B /usr/src/modules.
.TP
.B modules_image
This target allows you to build all packages under
.B /usr/src/modules,
but does not create the source or diff files, and does not create and sign
a changes file.
.SH FILES
Apart from the runtime options, the 
.I debian.rules
file run by
.B make\-kpkg
also looks for site\-wide defaults in the file 
.I /etc/kernel-pkg.conf.
The default configuration allows there to be a site wide override for
the full name and email address of the person responsible for maintaining 
the kernel packages on the site, but the 
.I /etc/kernel-pkg.conf
file is actually a 
Makefile
snippet, and any legal make directives may be included in there. 
.B Note:
Caution is urged with this file, since you can totally change the way that the 
make is run by suitable editing this file. Please look at
.I /usr/doc/kernel-package/Problems.gz
for a list of known problems while compiling kernel images.
