The file db_view.c if of unknown source, at least it is provided as a
gift so we can work with it. I have obtained it from
ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/msdos/languages/c/dbase.c. The file contains a
posting to comp.sys.ibm.pc from '87. I have saved the header in
db_view.header.

The file dBASE contains a description of the dBase II file format. I
have obtained it from one of the various CPAN Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network) ftp server in the
Internet, e.g.
ftp://ftp.switch.ch/mirror/CPAN/modules/dbperl/refinfo/formats/dBASE

The native site for this package is
ftp.infodrom.north.de/pub/Linux/Devel/dbview/.  New versions will
first occur there.
