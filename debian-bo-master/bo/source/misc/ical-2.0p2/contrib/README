This directory contains various pieces of contributed software.

ical.xbm		An icon bitmap for ical.  Thanks to
			"defert@gnuisance.cern.ch".  Put the following
			code in your ~/.tk/ical/user.tcl file if you
			want to use it --

			append-hook dayview-startup {view} {
			    wm iconbitmap [$view window] @<dir>/ical.xbm
			}

ical2calendar		Generate an old-style calendar(1) file
			from an ical calendar.  You might want
			to use this to get mailed reminders 
			every day.  You can also use the script
			as a template for writing other converters.

icaladd			Read an item from the standard input and add
			it to the calendar.  The date and times for
			the new item are extracted from the standard
			input if possible.

icaladdlines		Read one item per line from the standard input
			and add it to the calendar.  The date and times
			for the new items are extracted from the input
			if possible.  This script is a good way of
			converting an old style calendar(1) file to
			ical.  It is not perfect though.

icalexpire		Move expired items from the user's calendar
			into an archival calendar.  You may want
			to use this utility if ical starts using
			a lot of memory because your calendar
			contains a lot of expired items.

icalweekly		Print one-week-per-page organizer listings
			on appropriate stock.  Submitted by Jay Sekora. 

timeofday.tcl		Indicate the current time with an arrow in the
			appointment view.  Source this file in
			~/.tk/ical/user.tcl

weeknumber.tcl		Displays ISO week numbers along side the date
			selector.  Source this file in ~/.tk/ical/user.tcl
