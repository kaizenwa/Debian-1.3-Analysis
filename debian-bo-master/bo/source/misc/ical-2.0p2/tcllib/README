This directory contains some Tk widgets I use frequently.  Some of the
code uses my class system (implemented in class.tcl, documented in
class.doc).  That's right, yet another class system.  This one is very
minimal and reasonably efficient.

The important files are --

testlib				Allow the user to run various tests

class.doc			Documentation for class system
class.tcl			Class system
icon.tcl			Search for icon in a list of directories
warn.xbm			Until Tk 3.3 becomes widespread...

support.tcl			Miscellaneous routines
dialog_bug.tcl			Send bug notification via email
dialog_error.tcl		Report user error
dialog_string.tcl		Allow user to select a string
dialog_yn.tcl			Allow user to respond yes/no
dialog_ync.tcl			Allow user to respond yes/no/cancel
dialog_file.tcl			Allow user to select file
    fileselector.tcl		File selection widget
    stringbrowser.tcl		List of strings widget
