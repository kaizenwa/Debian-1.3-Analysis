Hi,

I have released Ical v2.0.  All information for ical is available via
the World-Wide-Web at

	http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/~sanjay/ical.html

For people without WWW access:

* Here is a brief blurb for people who don't know what ical is:
	* Ical is an X based calendar program 
	* Calendar items can be created edited and deleted easily. 
	* Items can be made to repeat in various ways. 
	* Ical will post reminders for upcoming appointments. 
	* Ical can print and list item occurrences. 
	* An ical calendar can include other calendars. 
	* Ical calendars can be shared by different users. 

* The source code is available via

	* FTP "ftp.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/sanjay"
	* WWW "http://clef.lcs.mit.edu/~sanjay/ical/ftp.html"

* Unfortunately I haven't had time to make any precompiled binaries
  for this release.  I decided it was better to release the code
  in a timely fashion than to delay everything until some unspecified
  date by which I could create binaries.

* You will need the following software installed on your machine:

	* A C++ compiler
	* Tcl 7.4 or later
	* Tk  4.0 or later

* Here is the list of changes since Ical v1.9:
