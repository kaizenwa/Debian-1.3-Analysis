<TITLE>ical - An X based Calendar Program</TITLE>
<!-- Changed by: Sanjay Ghemawat, 20-Jul-1995 -->

<H1>Synopsis</H1>

<em>Ical</em> provides an X interface for maintaining a calendar.  A
calendar is basically just a set of items. An item is either an
appointment, or a notice. An <A HREF="#appts">appointment</A> starts
at a particular time of the day, and finishes at a particular time of
the day. A <A HREF="#notes">notice</A> does not have any starting or
ending time. Notices are useful for marking certain days as
special. For example, a calendar may contain a notice for April 15th
indicating that taxes are due.  When the documentation below refers to
an <em>item</em>, it applies both to notices and appointments.  The
main features of <em>ical</em> are:

<UL>
<LI> Items can be created and edited easily.
<LI> Items can be <A HREF="#editing">cut, copied and pasted</A>.
<LI> Items can be made to <A HREF="#repeat">repeat</A> in various ways.
<LI> Ical will generate <A HREF="#alarms">alarms</A> for upcoming
     appointments.
<!--
<LI> Items can have links to files and Web documents.
-->
<LI> Users can view many calendars at a time.
<LI> Calendars can be <A HREF="#shared">shared</A> by many users.
<LI> Related items can be grouped in their own calendar.
</UL>

<H1>Invocation</H1>

You can specify various command line options to control <em>ical</em>.

</DL>

<H1>Windows</H1>

The main calendar window displays the appointments and notices for a
particular date.

<DL>

<DT> Date Selector
<DD> The top left portion of the window contains a date selector.  You
can click on the various arrows to change the month or the year.  The
day of the month can be selected by clicking on the appropriate day in
the month display.  The date selector contains various other buttons
for convenient date selection.

<DT> Notice Window
<DD> The bottom left portion of the window contains the notices for
the selected date. A scroll bar is provided if all of the notices for
the selected date do not fit into the notice window.

<DT> Appointment Window
<DD> The right portion of the window contains the appointments for the
selected day. You can scroll this region by using the scroll bar, or
by dragging with the middle mouse button in the background.

<DT> Menubar
<DD> A menubar runs along the top of the calendar window.  The
<em>File menu</em> allows you to create and destroy application
windows.

<DT> Status Line
<DD> The bottom portion of the window contains a status line. This
status line indicates the calendar from which the selected item comes
and whether or not the selected item repeats.

</DL>

<H1><A NAME=calendar_file>Calendar Files</A></H1>

A calendar is stored in a calendar file. The default calendar file is
named <CODE>.calendar</CODE> and is kept in the user's home
directory. If the <CODE>CALENDAR</CODE> environment variable is set,
its value is used as the name of the calendar file. The
<CODE>CALENDAR</CODE> environment variable and the default can both be
overridden by specifying a file name on the command line as follows --

	<PRE>
	ical -calendar <VAR>file-name</VAR>.
	</PRE>

<em>Ical</em> periodically saves any modifications made to a
calendar to the corresponding calendar file. It also periodically
incorporates changes made to a shared calendar file by other instances
of ical.  You can explicitly trigger these periodic saves and
reads by using the <A HREF="#file_menu">File menu</A>.

<H2><A NAME="shared">Including and Sharing Calendars</A></H2>

You can include other calendars into your private calendar. This
facility is mainly useful for allowing a group of people to share a
common set of items. For example, members of a particular group might
have a calendar that contains the birthdays for each member of the
group. This calendar can be included in each group member's private
calendar.  Use the <A HREF="#file_menu">File menu</A> to include and
exclude shared calendars.  Use the <em>Move Item To ...</em> entry
from the <A HREF="#item_menu">Item menu</A> to move items between
calendars.  Use the <em>From Calendar ...</em> entry in the <A
HREF="#list_menu">List menu</A> to list all items a particular
calendar.

<H1><A NAME="items">Items</A></H1>

<H2><A NAME="notes">Notices</A></H2>

You can enter notices by clicking in the background in the bottom-left
portion of the main calendar window. This click will create a new
notice for the selected date.  You can enter text into the notice by
typing into it while it is selected (selected notices are highlighted
by being displayed in different colors).  A notice can be selected for
editing by clicking with left button.

<H2><A NAME="appts">Appointments</A></H2>

You can enter appointments by left-clicking in the background in the
right portion of the main calendar window. This click will create a
new appointment for the selected date. The start time for this
appointment is determined by the click location. You can move the
appointment by dragging it with the middle mouse button held down. The
appointment can be resized by dragging with the right mouse button
held down.
<P>

Appointment text can be edited by typing into the appointment window
while it is selected.  If the appointment text you are typing in does
not fit into the appointment area, then it will overflow out of the
appointment area, but will be editable normally.  If you do not like
overflowing text, you should turn off the <em>Allow Text Overflow</em>
option in the <A HREF="#option_menu">Options menu</A> .  With this
option turned off, if the current text completely fills the area
allocated to the appointment, then any attempts to add to the
appointment text will be ignored until the appointment is enlarged
with the right mouse button.  Likewise, the right mouse button will
refuse to shrink an appointment window if the appointment text
completely fills the appointment window.

<H2><A NAME="alarms">Alarms</A></H2>

<em>Ical</em> generates alarms for appointments. By default, the first
alarm is generated fifteen minutes before the appointment is supposed
to start and successive alarms are generated every five minutes until
the appointment actually starts.  You can change this default behavior
by selecting the <em>Default Alarms</em> entry from the <A
HREF="#option_menu">Options menu</A>.  You can also change the timings
of these alarms on an appointment-by-appointment basis by
double-clicking on the appointment, or by selecting the appointment
and then chosing the <em>Properties</em> entry in the <A
HREF="#item_menu">Item menu</A>.

<H2><A NAME="repeat">Repeating Items</A></H2>

Items can be made to repeat in various ways. Item repetition can be
controlled by using the entries in the <A HREF="#repeat_menu">Repeat
menu</A>.  These entries make the item repeat in certain frequently
used ways. For example, the <em>Monthly</em> entry makes the selected
item repeat once per month and the <em>Weekly</em> entry makes the
selected item repeat once per week.  The <em>Edit Monthly</em>... and
<em>Edit Weekly</em>... entries can be used to make items that repeat
in more complex ways: for example, an item that occurs on the last
Friday of each month, or an item that occurs on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday every week.
<P>

In addition to making an item repeat in one of the pre-defined ways,
you can also restrict an item's starting and finishing date by
selecting the <em>Set Range</em>... entry from the
<A HREF="#repeat_menu">Repeat menu.</A>
<P>

Normally, a modification to a repeating item applies to all
occurrences of that item. A single occurrence of a repeating item can
be modified by selecting the occurrence and then choosing the
<em>Make</em> <em>Unique</em> entry from the <A
HREF="#repeat_menu">Repeat menu</A>.  The selected occurrence can now
be modified independently of the repeating item.

<H2>Todo Items</H2>

Items can be marked as <em>todo</em> items by selecting the
<em>Todo</em> entry in the <A HREF="#item_menu">Item menu</A>.  A
<em>todo</em> item is automatically moved forward to today's date
every day until the item is deleted or marked as done.  An item
can be marked as done by clicking in the little check-box right
next to the displayed item.

<!--
<H2>Links to External Documents</H2>
Items can contain links to files and other documents on the World-Wide-Web.
These links can be created and removed by selecting one of the entries
in the <A HREF="#item_menu">Item menu</A>.  An item with a link has a little
arrow in the top-right corner.  The link can be followed by clicking on
this arrow.
-->

<H2>Highlighting</H2>

By default, if any item occurs on a date, then the date is highlighted
in the date selector located in the top-left corner of the calendar
window.  You can use the <em>Highlight</em> entries in the <A
HREF="#item_menu">Item menu</A> to control this highlighting behavior
on an item-by-item basis.

<H1><A NAME="keys">Key Bindings</A></H1>

<em>This section is currently incomplete.</em>

<H1><A NAME="editing">Editing</A></H1>

Dragging with the left mouse button in a selected appointment or
notice sets the X selection.  The <A HREF="#edit_menu">Edit menu</A>
provides commands for dealing with the X selection.
<P>

Ical also has a clipboard that can store a single item. The
<em>Copy</em> entry in the <A HREF="#edit_menu">Edit menu</A> copies
the selected item into the clipboard.  The <em>Cut</em> entry does the
same, but it also deletes the item from the calendar. If the selected
item repeats, then the <em>Cut</em> command allows the user to delete
all occurrences of the item, or just the selected occurrence.
However, if the selected item does not belong to you, then
<em>Cut</em> just hides the item from you.  Other people will still
see the item.  An item in the clipboard can be inserted into the
current day by selecting <em>Paste</em> entry. The newly pasted item
loses all repetition information, and occurs just on the day in which
it was pasted.

<H1><A NAME=listing>Listing Items</A></H1>

You can generate listings of imminent items by selecting one of the
listing options in the <A HREF="#list_menu">List menu</A>.  You can
also use the command line options <code>-list</code>,
<code>-show</code>, or <code>-popup</code> to generate item listings.
The command line options are most useful in <code>.login</code> files.
<P>

By default an item is included in a listing for a particular date if
it occurs either on that date, or on the very next day.  You can
control this feature of item listings with the <em>List item</em>
entry in the <A HREF="#item_menu">Item menu.</A>

<H1><A NAME="print">Printing</A></H1>

Calendar contents can be printed by selecting the <em>Print</em>
option from the <A HREF="#file_menu">File menu</A>.

<H1>Customization</H1>

Some of <EM>ical's</EM> behavior can be customized via the <A
HREF="#option_menu">Options menu</A>.  Other aspects of ical's
behavior can be controlled via X Resources.

<H2>X Resources</H2>

<H3>Behavior</H3>

The following X resources can be used to control various aspects of
ical's behavior.

<DL>
<DT> Ical.pollSeconds
<DD> Shared calendars are checked for changes made by other people
     once every <em>pollSeconds</em> seconds.  The default value is
     120.  If <em>ical</em> appears sluggish, or if it is using too
     much CPU time, increase this value.

<DT> Ical.saveSeconds
<DD> Calendar files are saved once every <em>saveSeconds</em> seconds.
     The default value is 30.  If <em>ical</em> appears sluggish, or
     if it is using too much CPU time, increase this value.
</DL>

<H3>Dimensions</H3>

The following X resources can be used to control various dimensions of
ical's appearance.

<DL>
<DT> Ical.itemSelectWidth
<DD> The border width of selected items is set to the value of this
     option to display the selected status of the item to to the user.
     On color displays, the default value of this option is 1
     because on color displays selection is indicated by changing the
     color of the selected item.  On monochrome displays, the default
     value of <em>itemSelectWidth</em> is 4.

<DT> Ical.Dayview.geometry
<DD> X geometry specification for main calendar window.  Usually, you
     will just specify the window position here.  The size of the
     window is easier to control via the <em>Options</em> menu.

<DT> Ical.Reminder.geometry
<DD> X geometry specification for alarms.  Usually, you will just
     specify the window position here.  The window size will be
     calculated automatically.

<DT> Ical.Listing.geometry
<DD> X geometry specification for item listings.  Usually, you will
     just specify the window position here.  The window size will be
     calculated automatically.
</DL>

<H3>Colors</H3>

The following X resources can be used to customize ical's use of
colors.  If ical windows show up with illegible colors (not enough
distinction between background and foreground), it may be because your
X resources contain definitions for <CODE>*foreground</CODE> or
<CODE>*background</CODE> that conflict with ical colors.  In general,
it is a bad idea to define <CODE>*foreground</CODE> and
<CODE>*background</CODE> in your resources because it will break a
number of programs.  You will be better off defining resources on an
application by application basis.

<DL>
<DT> Ical*foreground/Ical*background
<DD> Foreground and background colors for most of ical's windows.

<DT> Ical*disabledForeground
<DD> Foreground color assigned to disabled buttons and menu entries.

<DT> Ical.itemFg/Ical.itemBg
<DD> Foreground and background colors for unselected items.  The
     default foreground is black and the default background is gray.

<DT> Ical.itemSelectFg/Ical.itemSelectBg
<DD> Foreground and background colors for selected items.  The default
     foreground is black and the default background is SlateBlue1.

<DT> Ical.itemOverflowColor/Ical.itemOverflowStipple
<DD> Background color and stippling used for appointment text that
     overflows out of the appointment area.  On color displays, the
     default overflow background is SlateBlue3 and no stippling is done
     (specified by an empty stipple option).  On monochrome displays,
     the default overflow background is black, and the default
     overflow stippling is gray50.

<DT> Ical.apptLineColor
<DD> The color for the background lines and times displayed in the
     appointment window.

<DT> Ical.weekdayColor
<DD> The color used to display days of the week.  The default is black.

<DT> Ical.weekendColor
<DD> The color used to display weekends.  The default is red.

<DT> Ical.interestColor
<DD> The color used to highlight interesting dates.  The default is blue.

<DT> Ical.weekendInterestColor
<DD> The color used to highlight interesting dates on weekends and
     holidays.  The default is purple.
</DL>

<H3>Fonts</H3>

The following resources can be used to customize ical's use of fonts.

<DL>

<DT> Ical.fontFamily
<DD> Preferred font family.  Fonts for various purposes are obtained
     from this family unless overridden with one of the specifications
     below.  The default font family is <CODE>times</CODE>.  Some other font
     families you can specify here are <CODE>charter</CODE>, <CODE>new
     century schoolbook</CODE>, and <CODE>helvetica</CODE>.  My
     personal favorite is <CODE>new century schoolbook</CODE>.

<DT> Ical.fontSize
<DD> Font sizes used for ical.  Use the value <code>small</code> to
    use small font sizes everywhere.  Any other value for this option
    defaults to the normal fonts.

<DT> Ical*itemFont
<DD> Font used to display item contents.

<DT> Ical.weekdayFont
<DD> Font used for displaying days of the week.

<DT> Ical.weekendFont
<DD> Font used for displaying weekends.

<DT> Ical.interestFont
<DD> Font used to highlight interesting dates.

<DT> Ical.weekendInterestFont
<DD> Font used to highlight interesting dates on weekends and holidays.

<DT> Ical.smallHeadingFont
<DD> Font used for small headings.

<DT> Ical.largeHeadingFont
<DD> Font used for large headings.

<DT> Ical*&lt;<em>class</em>&gt;*font:
<DD> Font used for windows of a certain class.  Possible values for
     &lt;<em>class</em>&gt; are <CODE>Dialog</CODE>,
     <CODE>Button</CODE>, <CODE>Label</CODE>, <CODE>Menubutton</CODE>,
     <CODE>Menu</CODE>, <CODE>Listbox</CODE>, and <CODE>Reminder</CODE>.
</DL>

<H2>Tcl Code</H2>

Users can also customize ical by writing tcl code and storing it in
the file <SAMP>~/.tk/ical/user.tcl</SAMP>.  The code stored in this
file is executed when ical starts up.
<p>
Ical also looks for site-specific customizations at startup.  These
customizations can be placed in the file <samp>site.tcl</samp> in
either the ical library directory, or its parent directory.  (By
default, ical looks for site.tcl in
<samp>/usr/local/lib/ical/v[<em>version</em>]/</samp>, and
<samp>/usr/local/lib/ical/</samp>, but these directories
 may be located elsewhere on your system.)  The site specific files
will be loaded in before any user specific customization file is
loaded in.
<P>
See the document <A HREF="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/~sanjay/ical/interface.ps">
Customizing Ical</A> for help on writing tcl code for customizing ical.
This document is available via the World Wide Web at the following location.

<blockquote>
http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/~sanjay/ical/interface.ps
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Ical can run even when X is not available, therefore
customization files should be written so that they will function
even when Tk commands are not available.</strong>

     Note that this will only change the alarm times for the
     selected appointments.  You can make this change for all appointments
     that do not have special alarm times by using the
     <em>Default Alarms</em> entry in the
     <A HREF="#option_menu">Options menu</A>.

<DT> Early Warning
<DD> By default an item is included in a listing for a particular date
     if it occurs either on that date, or on the very next day.
     Sometimes, you may want to include an item in listings for
     earlier dates. For example, if you have an item reminding you of
     a birthday on March 17th, you might want this item to be included
     in all listings from March 7th to March 17th so that you will
     have enough time to go out and buy a present.  You can achieve
     this effect by selecting this menu entry and then entering "10 days"
     into the resulting dialog.<P>

     Note that this will only change the listing behavior for the
     selected item.  You can make this change for all items you create
     from now on by using the <em>Default Listings</em> entry in the

<DD> Use this menu entry to change the time intervals at which alarms
     go off.  The factory settings cause alarms to be triggered
     fifteen minutes before each appointment, and then once every five
     minutes until the appointment actually starts.  This menu entry
     changes the default alarm behavior for all appointments.  You can
     override this default behavior on an appointment-by-appointment
     basis by selecting an appointment and then selecting the
     <em>Change</em> <em>Alarms</em> entry in the <em>item</em> menu.


<DT> Default Listings
<DD> This menu can be used to select the default listing behavior for
     newly created items.  If the <em>On Occurrence</em> entry is
     selected, then a newly created item will only be shown in the
     listing of the day on which the item occurs.  If the <em>A Day
     Early</em> entry is selected, then a new item will be shown in
     listings starting a day before the item occurrence.  Similarly,
     the other menu entries can be selected to make new items show up
     in listings a number of days before their actual occurrence.
     This menu selects the default behavior for new items.  Individual
     item behavior can be controlled by similar entries in the
     <A HREF="#item_menu">Item menu</A>.
