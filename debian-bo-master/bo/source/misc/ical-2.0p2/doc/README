This directory contains ical documentation.

	ical.{html,man,doc}	Man page in various formats
	interface.ps		The TCL interface to ical

The tcl interface to ical will be useful to people who wish to
customize ical.  The source of the tcl interface documentation is in
"interface.gtex", but that file requires processing via some local
tools that are not being shipped with ical.  Print out "interface.ps"
for the documentation instead, or run "interface.tex" through latex.
