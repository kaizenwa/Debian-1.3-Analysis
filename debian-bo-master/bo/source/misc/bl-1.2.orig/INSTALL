Edit bl.c and change the LED #defines to suit your keyboard LED layout. 

Check the Makefile for your preferences of installation locations, CFLAGS
and LDFLAGS.

Then, type 'make' and off you go.  'make install' will install the
man page and binary.  'make man' formats the man page for you to read.

Enjoy,
