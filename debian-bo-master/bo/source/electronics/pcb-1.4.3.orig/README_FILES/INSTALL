-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The release has been successfully compiled on the following platforms:

X11R4
	Check the GNU info file for problems.
	The dynamic offset for printouts is not supported because of the
	missing panner widget.

HP 700 (9.*, 10.*) and 800 (9.*, 10.*)
	All HP machines require the MIT release of X11R5 (or R6 of the
	XConsortium). HP does not ship the Athena Widgets with its release nor
	necessary tools like imake... but you can get them as a patch.
	You will also have to get yourself an ANSI compiler if you are stuck
	with HPs cc.

Sun Solaris 2.[345]
	You won't have any problems if you use X11R5 or later. 
	Using OpenWindows will cause some of them. See the GNU info file for
	details about it.

Silicon Graphics IRIX 5.3)
	No problems beside additional CFLAGS in Imakefile. Check if you are
	using a R4 server and, if you do, read the GNU info file of pcb.

Linux 0.99pl14 and later, XFree 2.1.1 and later
	No problems.

SCO ODT 3.0
	Needs tls003 of the Athena Widget library from sosco.sco.com
	(mailed by John DuBois <spcecdt@deeptht.armory.com>).

FreeBSD
NetBSD
	Get latest version of bison and flex as a replacement for yacc and lex.

Ultrix
	use GCC to get a binary with all features working :-)

DEC UNIX V3.2
	you may have to call
		xmkmf
		make Makefiles
		make includes
		make depend
	instead of using 'xmkmf -a'

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     ***** YOU MUST HAVE AN ANSI COMPILER TO COMPILE THESE SOURCES *****

Here's how to install:

1. Edit config.h:
   - define the installation path for fonts...
   - if your architecture isn't listed, define
       EXITCALL as:
         -DHAS_ATEXIT if your system supports atexit()
         -DHAS_ON_EXIT if your system supports on_exit()
		 or none of them if the OS doesn't support it
	   BTNMOD as:
	     - some X modifier key if you run HP-VUE
       PATCHES as
         -DNEED_STRDUP if your system does not have strdup()
       SYS_LIBRARIES as
         -ll (for lex) plus -lm
         -lfl (for flex) plus -lm
     add some additional defines as needed. If it works ok mail a copy to
     the author to be included in the next (sub)release.

2. Run 'xmkmf -a' to create the Makefile or if you don't have it
	 imake -DUseInstalled -I<X11 config directory>
	 make Makefiles
	 make includes
	 make depend
   Don't care about warnings at this time.

3. Run 
	   (cd doc; make)
	   (cd src; make Pcb.ad)
   to create a man page, the application default resource file, a GNU
   info file as well as documentation in PostScript forman. A
   reference card for your configuration is also created. Manuals for
   the default configuration as well as texinfo.tex can be found in doc/.

4. Get yourself a printed copy of the documentation and of the 'Pcb.ad'.
   Read 'Whats_new*' to see if old file have to be updated.

5. Run 'make' to build the program, it's manpage and the resource file
   if they haven't been build in step (3).

6. Change to the 'src' directory.

6. Test the program before you install it to see if the application defaults
   match your window environment.
       ./pcbtest.sh
   does the trick.
   
7. Take the printed copies from (2) and check if the translations work
   (see chapter 'Getting Started') by running
       ./pcbtest.sh ../example/68HC11
   It comes up with a 68HC11 microcontroller layout.

   Take special care on the resources related to functions keys and the
   pointer buttons because most of the window managers use them too.
   Change 'Pcb.ad.raw' according to your hardware/software environment.
   You may have to change all occurances of 'baseTranslations' to
   'translations' in your resource file if you use X11R4.

   You have to get newer versions of yacc/lex (bison/flex) if the
   program fails parsing the default font or the demo file.

8. When you're satisfied with the defaults and the program run:
	   cd ..
       make install
       make install.man
       make install.info
   as a user with the appropriate rights. Depending on the filemodes set
   by your X11 environment you must remove existing copies of fonts,
   manpage and program before you are able to install successfully.
   Set umask to 022 else the new created directories wont be world
   readable; the fonts cannot be found.

9. Read 'MAILING' in this directory.


If yout create any element files or package description files I would be glad
to get a copy to include them into the next release or an additional archive.


Have fun with it.

Thomas
