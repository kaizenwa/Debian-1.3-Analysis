This is a bug-fix only release:

Circuits haven't been loadable from an installed version of pcb because
of shell quoting in the resource file. The bug has been reported by
	Andreas Czechanowski <m075@ins.Uni-Stuttgart.DE>
	Ulrich Pegelow <ulrpeg@bigcomm.gun.de>
in common with a fix. There are also some typos in the manual concerning
bit numbering in the file description.
