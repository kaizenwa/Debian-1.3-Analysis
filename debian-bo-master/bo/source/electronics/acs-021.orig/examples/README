Here are some ACS example circuits.  Some of these will also run
on Spice and can be used for comparison.

You can run them in batch mode by typing "acs name" from the shell.
You can run them interactively by starting acs then "get name".
Then play, change probes, rerun, change values, etc.

The files "runall", "runsmall", and "runsmall.bat" are scripts
so you can automate the testing.  "runsmall.bat" is for MSDOS.
"runsmall" runs only the circuits small enough to run on the DOS
version.  "runall" runs most of them.  Read the scripts before 
using them.

"runall.out" is the result of running "runall".  Ideally, you should
get identical results, but there are often small differences in 
the machine math functions that will give small differences in the 
results.  Any numerically significant difference represents a serious
bug and should be addressed.
