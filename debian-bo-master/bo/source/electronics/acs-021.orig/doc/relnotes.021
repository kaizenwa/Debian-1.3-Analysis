ACS 0.21 release notes  (03/30/96)

There are several changes, most of which are only visible in subtle
ways from the outside.

1. The code is more conformant with the upcoming standard, particularly
in the use of complex, templates, lifetime of temporaries, and for
scope.  This should fix problems compiling with g++ 2.7.

2. Element commons are freed properly.

3. The manner in which elements are loaded into the matrix is
different, and should be faster for large circuits with latency.
Model bypass is more complete, because it is no longer necessary
to do anything with a latent model.  It makes little difference
for small circuits, and circuits that are mostly active.  Speed
gains on small circuits are offset by #4.

4. The bypass criteria are more strict.  It was possible to get
incorrect results through interaction between model evaluation
bypass and iteration damping.  This release will not bypass anything
when damping is in effect.  There is a slight speed penalty.

5. Logic devices work even when there is no analog model.  The bug
causing a failure in this case has been fixed.  The "bug" (that
could in a twisted sense be called a feature) that leads to random
mapping on start-up is still there.  The logic model still needs
work.

6. The code is somewhat more object-oriented.  Some classes have
been changed to be more general.
