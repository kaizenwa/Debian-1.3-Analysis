This is the Debian GNU/Linux Binary CD. It is part of a two-CD set, the
other CD containing the source. If you purchased this CD without the
source code, the person or company from whom you purchased the CD is
obligated to provide you with the corresponding source-code for no
more than a reasonable charge for copying and distribution media. For
details of the software licenses and the provisions in them requiring
source-code distribution, see the copyrights of the individual software
packages in /usr/doc/*/copyright on the installed system.

A complete Debian system, including source code, is always available on
most Debian FTP sites. Two such sites are ftp.debian.org and
debian.crosslink.net . The file /pub/debian/README.mirrors on those systems
contains the current list of Debian FTP sites.
