Colophon

All of the software used to produce this CD is part of the Debian system,
and is distributed on this CD. The scripts used to create the CD are in
the "debian-cd" package. Other packages used are "mkisofs", for constructing
the ISO 9660 filesystem images, and "cdwrite" for writing the ISO images
to a CD-writable disc.

If you have a CD-writer compatible with "cdwrite", you should be able to
write a Debian CD as good as this one, using only the software on your
Debian system.
