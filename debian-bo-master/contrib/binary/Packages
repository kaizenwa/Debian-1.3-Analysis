 .
      Support for 8, 15, 16, & 24 bit displays
      Ordered and Floyd-Steinberg Dithering for 8 bit
      RGB, Grayscale, & Indexed color modes
      Multiple views of same image to ease complex tasks
      Fast zooming and panning on images
      Full suite of selection tools - (rectangle, ellipse, freehand,
        fuzzy, bezier, intelligent)
      Transform tools - (rotate, scale, shear, flip)
      Crop, color picker, bucket-fill, blend, & text tools
      Paint tools - (paintbrush, airbrush, clone, blur, sharpen, convolve)
      Full set of brush masks and support for arbitrary brushes
      File format support - (jpg, tif, gif, png, xpm)
      Numerous effects filters - (blur, edge detect, pixelize, ...)
      Channel operations - (add, composite, blend, ...)
 .
 A good deal of the GIMP's functionality is invested in external
 modules, called plug-ins.  These independent programs are called from
 the GIMP to run as separate processes and carry out essential tasks
 such as loading and saving images, running effects filters, combining
 multiple images with channel operations, and communicating with other
 programs (such as scanning software, ray tracers, other image
 manipulation packages, etc).  Programmers are invited/urged to add

 npasswd changes or installs a login password for username (your own
 by default).  Only the super-user can change another users' password.
 .
 When changing a password, npasswd prompts for the old password
 and then for the new one.  The new password must be typed twice to
 forestall mistakes.  The new password is checked for reasonableness.
 .
 This is npasswd-boulder + cracklib 5.  I needed it because one of
 my clients had 50% of his Debian users' passwds cracked by crack.
 Some have argued that npasswd + cracklib offers as much (or more)
 security than shadow passwd.  I'm not a security guru, but it's better
 than the default passwd under Debian for multi-user systems.

 can be used to build interaction forms in a WYSIWYG (what you see
 is what you get) way and to generate the corresponding C code for
 you.  50+ demos in source code are distributed with the library.
 .
 For compilation of the examples you need to have the xpm-dev package
 installed.

Description: A user-friendly X interface to pppd/chat.
 The xisp package implements a user-friendly X interface
 to pppd/chat and provides maximum feedback from the dial-in and login
 phases on a browser screen. It also provides greater versatility in
 interrupting a call in progress and in general enhances the user's
 feeling of "what's going on", especially if he/she is not all that well
 acquainted with the intricacies of system log files. It's also much
 nicer to look at as compared to connection scripts writing output on
 the terminal :) The main application, xisp, relies on a special dialer,
 xispdial, which is spawned by pppd in order to do the dialing.
