description: tin - Threaded Internet News reader
 It has a powerful full screen text mode user interface, where
 most actions are available at the press of a single key.  It is
 highly configurable.
 .
 tin can read news from a news server via NNTP (the Network News Transfer 
 Protocol) or from the local host (/var/spool/news).  You must have either
 a news server available - large sites usually provide a site-wide server, 
 or the articles local on the host in /var/spool/news.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing
 just local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you
 can configure tin to access it.
