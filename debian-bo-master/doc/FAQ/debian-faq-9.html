<H2><A NAME="Uptodate"></A> <A NAME="s9">9. Keeping Your Debian System Up To Date </A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 How can I upgrade my Debian 0.93 (or earlier) distribution, based on a.out format binaries, to 1.1 (or later), based on ELF binaries?</A></H2>

<P>The directory <CODE>upgrades/</CODE> contains files needed by users upgrading 
from Debian 0.93R6 to Debian 1.1 (or later).  There are two ways to upgrade:
<UL>
<LI>the manual way, installing the packages by hand. Instructions are
in <CODE>upgrade_manual.doc</CODE>.  You will also need the files 
<CODE>UpGrade</CODE>, <CODE>base_list</CODE>, and <CODE>dpkg-*.deb</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>using dselect to upgrade all the packages <I>en masse</I>.
Instructions are in <CODE>upgrade_dselect.doc</CODE>.  You will also need
<CODE>dpkg-*.deb</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Note that the version of <CODE>dpkg</CODE> in this directory has the 
a.out binary format.  The versions of <CODE>dpkg</CODE> in the development 
and stable trees have the ELF format.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 How can I keep my Debian system current?</A></H2>

<P>One could simply execute an anonymous ftp call to a Debian archive, then
peruse the directories until he finds the desired file, and then fetch it,
and finally install it using <CODE>dpkg</CODE>.  Note that <CODE>dpkg</CODE> 
will install upgrade files in place, even on a running system.  
Sometimes, a revised package will require the
installation of a newly revised version of another package, in which case
the installation will fail until/unless the other package is installed.</P>

<P>Many people find this approach much too time-consuming, since
Debian evolves so quickly---typically, a dozen or more new
packages are uploaded every week.  This number is larger just before a
new major release.  To deal with this avalanche, many people prefer to
use an automated programs.  Three different packages are available for
this purpose:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>dpkg-ftp</CODE>
<A NAME="dpkgftp"></A> 
.
This is an access method for <CODE>dselect</CODE>. It can be invoked from within
<CODE>dselect</CODE>, thereby allowing a user the ability to download files 
and install them directly in one step.  To do this, bring up the 
<CODE>dselect</CODE> program, choose option &quot;0&quot; (&quot;Choose
the access method to use&quot;), highlight the option &quot;ftp&quot;
then specify the remote hostname and directory.  
<CODE>dpkg-ftp</CODE> will then automatically download the files that are
selected (either in this session of <CODE>dselect</CODE> or earlier ones).
<P>Note that, unlike the <CODE>mirror</CODE> program,  
<CODE>dpkg-ftp</CODE> does not grab everything at a mirror site.
Rather, it downloads only those files which you have selected (when first
starting up <CODE>dpkg-ftp</CODE>), and which need to be updated.</P>
<P><CODE>dpkg-ftp</CODE> is available in the directory 
<CODE>stable/binary-all/net/</CODE> on any Debian archive.</P>

</LI>
<LI><CODE>mirror</CODE>.  This Perl script, and its (optional) manager program
called <CODE>mirror-master</CODE>, can be used to fetch user-specified parts
of a directory tree from a specified host <I>via</I> anonymous ftp.  
<CODE>mirror</CODE> is particularly useful
for downloading large volumes of software.  After the first time files have
been downloaded from a site, a file called <CODE>.mirrorinfo</CODE> is
stored on the local host.  Changes to the remote filesystem are
tracked automatically by <CODE>mirror</CODE>, which compares this file to
a similar file on the remote system and downloads only changed files.  
<P>The <CODE>mirror</CODE> program is generally useful for updating local copies of
remote directory trees.  The files fetched need not be Debian files.
(Since <CODE>mirror</CODE> is a Perl script, it can also run on non-Unix systems.)
Though the <CODE>mirror</CODE> program provides mechanisms for excluding files whose
names match user-specified strings, this program is most useful when
the objective is to download whole directory trees, rather than selected
packages.</P>
<P>The <CODE>mirror</CODE> program has been packaged for Debian, and is
found in the directory
<CODE>stable/binary-all/net</CODE> in the Debian FTP archive.</P>

</LI>
<LI><CODE>dftp</CODE>
<A NAME="dftp"></A> 
.  This Perl script can 
be used to fetch user-specified Debian packages from a specified host.  
It begins by downloading the Packages.gz files for the directories 
specified by the user (e.g. stable, contrib, non-free) and presents him 
with a list of packages.  These are placed in
various sections: new upgrades, downgrades, new packages, ignored
upgrades, and ignored packages.  The user then selects the packages he wants 
and dftp downloads and installs them.  This makes it very easy to have
your Debian system 100% current all the time without downloading
packages that you are not going to install.  
<P><CODE>dftp</CODE> can be used to call 
<A HREF="debian-faq-7.html#dselect">dselect</A>,
thereby providing an integrated way to fetch and update the Debian packages
on one's system.  When the installation is finished, another <CODE>dftp</CODE> 
command can be used to remove the package archive (&quot;.deb&quot;) files.
Changes to the remote filesystem are tracked automatically by 
<CODE>dftp</CODE>, which compares the local Packages.gz file to the files on 
the remote system.</P>
<P>The dftp program is available as a script in the directory
<CODE>project/misc</CODE> in the Debian FTP archive.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Must I go into single user mode in order to upgrade a package?</A></H2>

<P>No.  Packages can be upgraded in place, even in running systems.
Debian has a <CODE>start-stop-daemon</CODE> program
that is invoked to stop, then restart running process if necessary during
a package upgrade. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Do I have to keep all those .deb archive files on my disk?</A></H2>

<P>No.  If you have downloaded the files to your disk (which is not absolutely
necessary (see 
<A HREF="#dpkgftp">dpkg-ftp</A> or 
<A HREF="#dftp">dftp</A>)), 
then after you have installed the packages, you can remove
them from your system.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5 How can I keep a log of the packages I added to the system?</A></H2>

<P><CODE>dpkg</CODE> keeps a record of the packages that have been unpacked,
configured, removed, and/or purged, but does not (currently) keep a log
of terminal activity that occured while a package was being so manipulated.
Some users overcome this simply by using <CODE>tee</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dpkg -iGOEB -R stable/binary non-free/binary contrib/binary | \
    tee -a /root/dpkg.log
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The same command written using long options:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dpkg --install --refuse-downgrade --selected-only \
  --skip-same-version --auto-deconfigure \
  --recursiv estable/binary non-free/binary contrib/binary | \
    tee -a /root/dpkg.log
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</P>
