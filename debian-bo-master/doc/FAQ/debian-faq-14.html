<H2><A NAME="Contributing"></A> <A NAME="s14">14. Contributing to the Debian project </A></H2>

<P>Donations of time (to develop new packages, maintain existing
packages, or provide user support), resources (to mirror the FTP and WWW
archives), and money (to pay for new testbeds as well as hardware for
the archives) can help the project.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="contrib"></A> <A NAME="ss14.1">14.1 How can I become a Debian software developer?</A>
</H2>

<P>The development of Debian is open to all, and new users
with the right skills and/or the willingness to learn are needed to
maintain existing packages which have been &quot;orphaned&quot; by
their previous maintainers, to develop new packages, and to provide user
support.
<P>To develop a Debian package, you should:
<UL>
<LI>(of course) download Debian and install it on your 
system.</LI>
<LI>find a program you would like to package that is not presently part
of Debian.  In this regard, the  Work Needing and Prospective Packages document
(available as 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/prospective-packages.txt">/debian/doc/package-developer/prospective-packages.txt</A> at the Debian FTP server) should serve as a useful guide.
</LI>
<LI>Subscribe to debian-devel.
<P>To do this execute   
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        mail debian-devel-REQUEST@lists.debian.org -s Subscribe
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

That is, send mail to the above address with the subject set to 'Subscribe'.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Publish your plan in debian-devel.
<P>Send a mail to debian-devel that explains what you plan to do. So other 
developers can give some hints.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Set up your PGP key.
<P>Install the PGP package; read /usr/doc/pgp/; generate a 
public-secret key pair by typing <CODE>pgp -kg</CODE>
and answering the questions.  (Be prepared to write some arbitrary text 
when asked.  PGP generates its true random numbers by measuring the 
intervals between your keystrokes.)
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Shake hands with the project administration:
<P>Send an e-mail to 
<A HREF="mailto:new-maintainer@debian.org">new-maintainer@debian.org</A><P>with this content:
<UL>
<LI> what you have done,</LI>
<LI> who you are, </LI>
<LI> request for an account on master,</LI>
<LI> request to be subscribed to debian-private (the developers-only 
mailing list). </LI>
<LI> your PGP key, obtained by executing 'pgp -kxa'.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make the programs:  .deb, .diff, .tar.gz, .changes.
<P>Use the <CODE>hello*deb</CODE> and <CODE>dpkg*deb</CODE> packages as guides,
and read the <I>policy manual</I> and <I>dpkg programmers manual</I>.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Upload the files to
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>ftp://master.debian.org/home/Debian/ftp/private/project/Incoming/</CODE>
using your user-name and password, or</LI>
<LI><CODE>ftp://ftp.chiark.greenend.org.uk/</CODE> using anonymous ftp.
<P>For instructions to upload to chiark, read this file at chiark:
<CODE>/pub/debian/private/project/README.how-to-upload</CODE>.
<I>chiark</I> then sends the files it gets to master.
</LI>
</UL>

</UL>
<P>
<H3>Are there additional information resources for developers?</H3>

<P>Besides <CODE>debian-devel</CODE>, there are these mailing lists:
<UL>
<LI>The SPARC port developers list:  debian-sparc@lists.debian.org.</LI>
<LI>The Alpha port developers list: debian-alpha@lists.debian.org.</LI>
<LI>The Motorola 680x0 port developers list: debian-68k@lists.debian.org.</LI>
<LI>The dpkg development list: debian-dpkg@lists.debian.org.</LI>
<LI>Debian for Hams: debian-hams@lists.debian.org.</LI>
<LI>Debian package maintainers only: debian-private@lists.debian.org.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To subscribe to debian-devel, or other developers' list, send a
message to 
<A HREF="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org">listmaster@lists.debian.org</A>
with a one-line explanation of what you would like to test or develop.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.2">14.2 How can I contribute resources to the Debian project?</A>
</H2>

<P>Since the project aims to make a substantial body of software rapidly
and easily accessible throughout the globe, mirrors are urgently needed.
It is desirable but not absolutely necessary to mirror all of the archive.
The current components amount to just over 1.4 GBytes, broken down roughly
as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>non-free: 120 MBytes.</LI>
<LI>contrib: 30 MBytes.</LI>
<LI>Debian-1.3 (including updates): 850 MBytes.</LI>
<LI>unstable: 450 MBytes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Most of the mirroring is accomplished entirely automatically by scripts, 
without any human intervention.  However, the occasional glitch or system
change occurs which requires human intervention.
<P>If you have a high-speed connection to the Internet, the resources to
mirror all or part of the distribution, and are willing to
take the time (or find someone) who can provide regular maintenance of
the system, then please contact Bruce Perens (E-Mail: 
<A HREF="mail:bruce@pixar.com">bruce@pixar.com</A>;
Voice (work):  510-215-3502).

<H2><A NAME="SupportingOrganizations"></A> <A NAME="ss14.3">14.3 How can I contribute financially to the Debian project?</A>
</H2>

<P>One can make individual donations to one of two organizations that
are critical to the development of the Debian project.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SPI"></A> Software in the Public Interest</H3>

<P>
<P>Software in the Public Interest (SPI) is a non-profit organization 
formed when FSF withdrew their sponsorship of Debian.  We are currently 
incorporating as an IRS 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The purpose 
of the organization is
to develop and distribute free software. Our goals are very much like
those of FSF, and we encourage programmers to use the GNU General
Public License on their programs. However, we have a slightly different
focus in that we are building and distributing a Linux system that
diverges in many technical details from the GNU system planned by FSF.
We still communicate with FSF, and we cooperate in sending them changes
to GNU software and in asking our users to donate to FSF and the GNU
project.                        
<P>SPI can be reached at:

<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="FSF"></A> Free Software Foundation</H3>

<P>At this time there is no formal connection between Debian and the Free
Software Foundation. However, the Free Software Foundation is
responsible for some of the most important software components in
Debian, including the GNU C compiler, GNU Emacs, and much of the C
run-time library that is used by all programs on the system. FSF pioneered
much of what free software is today: they wrote the General Public
License that is used on much of the Debian software, and they invented
the "GNU" project to create an entirely free Unix system. Debian should
be considered a descendent of the GNU system.
<P>When you make a donation to FSF, please be sure to tell them that you
are a Debian user. Please contact them at:
