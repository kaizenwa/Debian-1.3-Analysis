<P>
<H2><A NAME="DebianDocs"></A> <A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 What other documentation exists on and for a Debian system?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Installation instructions for the current release:  see  
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/1.1/install.html">http://www.debian.org/1.1/install.html</A>.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>dpkg programmer's manual and Debian policy manual
<UL>
<LI>The 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/programmer.ps.gz">dpkg programmer's manual</A> is the primary documentation on the
technical aspects of creating Debian binary and source packages.
<P>The 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/policy.ps.gz">Debian policy manual</A> documents the policy requirements for a
package to be included in Debian.
<P>These documents are also included in the latest <CODE>dpkg-dev</CODE> package.
</LI>
</UL>


<P>
</LI>
<LI>Documentation on installed Debian packages:  
Most packages have files that are unpacked into 
<CODE>/usr/doc/</CODE> and <CODE>/usr/doc/examples/</CODE>.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Documentation on the Linux project:
The Debian package <CODE>doc-linux_VVV-RRR.deb</CODE> installs all of the most
recent versions of the HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs from the 
<A HREF="http://www.linux.locus.halcyon.com/">Linux Documentation Project</A>.
This package is in the <CODE>stable/binary-all/doc/</CODE> section 
in the FTP archives. 
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Unix-style 'man' pages:  Most commands have 
manual pages written in the style of the original Unix 'man' files.
They are referenced by the section of the 'man' directory where they
reside:  e.g., foo(3) refers to a manual page which resides in /usr/man/man3/,
and it can be called by executing the command: 
<CODE>man 3 foo</CODE>, or just <CODE>man foo</CODE> if section 3 is the only one
containing a page on <CODE>foo</CODE>.
One can learn which directory of <CODE>/usr/man/</CODE> contains a certain
manual page by executing <CODE>man -w foo</CODE>.
<P>New Debian users should note that the 'man' pages of many general system 
commands are not available until they install these packages (both of
which are normally stored in the <CODE>stable/binary-all/doc/</CODE>
directory of the Debian FTP archive:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>manpages_VVV-RRR.deb</CODE>
(see 
<A HREF="debian-faq-5.html#nonEngl">support for non-English languages</A>).</LI>
<LI><CODE>man_VVV-RRR.deb</CODE>, which contains the <CODE>man</CODE> program 
itself, and other programs for manipulating the manual pages.  
<P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>GNU-style 'info' pages:  User documentation for many commands,
particularly GNU tools, is available not in 'man' pages, but in 'info' 
files which can be read by the GNU tool <CODE>info</CODE> or by running 
<CODE>M-x info</CODE> within GNU Emacs.
Its main advantage over the original
'man' pages are that it is a hypertext system.  It does <EM>not</EM>
require the WWW, however; <CODE>info</CODE> can be run from a plain text
console.  It was designed by Richard Stallman and preceded the WWW.  
The program that manipulates `info' files is installed
as a separate package <CODE>info_VVV-RRR.deb</CODE>, usually stored in 
the directory <CODE>stable/binary-all/doc/</CODE> on the FTP archive.  </LI>

<H2><A NAME="resources"></A> <A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 Are there any on-line resources for discussing Debian?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are several Debian-related mailing lists:
<UL>
<LI><B>debian-announce@lists.debian.org (moderated)</B>.
(Usually) major system announcements.  On average,
fewer than one message per week are posted here.
</LI>
<LI><B>debian-changes@lists.debian.org</B>.
Announcements of new package uploads for the Debian system. 
This list may carry several announcements in a day.     
</LI>
<LI><B>debian-user@lists.debian.org 
<A NAME="debian-user"></A> </B>.
A mailing list where users can ask for and receive advice on the
use or configuration of Debian packages or other aspects of Debian Linux.
This list is an invaluable learning resource;
there can be 50 messages a day or more on this list.     
</LI>
<LI><B>debian-sparc@lists.debian.org 
<A NAME="debian-sparc"></A> </B>.
This list is for those involved in porting Debian software to the SPARC
platform.
</LI>
<LI><B>debian-alpha@lists.debian.org 
<A NAME="debian-alpha"></A> </B>.
This list is for those involved in porting Debian software to DEC alpha
platforms.
</LI>
<LI><B>debian-68k@lists.debian.org 
<A NAME="debian-68k"></A> </B>.
This list is for those involved in porting Debian software to Motorola 680x0
platforms; currently this means the Atari and Amiga only.
</LI>
<LI><B>debian-talk@lists.debian.org 
<A NAME="debian-talk"></A> </B>.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>To subscribe to debian-X (for X in announce, changes, user, talk), 
send mail to 
debian-X-request@lists.debian.org with the word &quot;subscribe&quot; in 
the Subject: header.
If you have a forms-capable World Wide Web browser, you can
subscribe to debian-announce and debian-user by using the 
<A HREF="http://www.rahul.net/perens/Debian/MailingLists.html">WWW form</A>. 
You can also un-subscribe using that form.
<P>The list manager's e-mail address is 
<A HREF="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org">listmaster@lists.debian.org</A><P>Archives of the Debian mailing lists are available via WWW at 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/">http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/</A> and via FTP from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/debian-lists/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/debian-lists/</A>.
<P>Users can address questions to individual package maintainers, since their
e-mail addresses are provided in the Debian control file (see section
<A HREF="debian-faq-6.html#CtlFile">Debian control file</A>)
that is included within each package.  One can also learn the maintainers' 
names and e-mail addresses by searching the &quot;Packages&quot; file, since
this file is just a concatenation of all the available package control files 
in a particular directory tree. To extract a control file from a 
particular Debian package, use the command,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dpkg --info packageName_VVV-RRR.deb
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Another related mailing list, <B>debiangame</B>, is being run by Gary Moore 
(
<A HREF="mailto:gary@ssc.com">mailto:gary@ssc.com</A>)
at the University of Washington.  As the name suggests, it is devoted
to the discussion of games that have been (or might be) packaged for Debian.
To subscribe, send mail to <CODE>listproc@u.washington.edu</CODE>, putting in
the message body: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  subscribe debiangame FirstName LastName
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Both FirstName and LastName are required for ListProc.
<P>
<P>Users should post non-Debian-specific questions to one of
the Linux Usenet groups, which are named comp.os.linux.* or
linux.*.  Specialized Systems Consultants (a.k.a. SSC) maintains a 
<A HREF="http://www.ssc.com/linux/news.html">list of Linux, Unix, X, and networking newsgroups</A>
on their WWW site.

<H2><A NAME="MailingListConduct"></A> <A NAME="ss12.3">12.3 What is the code of conduct for the mailing lists? </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>When using the Debian mailing lists, please follow these rules:
<UL>
<LI>Do not flame; it is not polite.  Besides the people developing Debian
are all volunteers, donating their time, energy and money in an
attempt to bring the Debian project together.</LI>
<LI>Do not use foul language; some people receive the lists via packet
radio, where swear words are illegal.</LI>
<LI>Make sure that you are using the proper list.</LI>
<LI>Do not try posting unless you are subscribed.  Posting by 
non-subscribers was turned off to make the mailing lists usable.
Thus, only postings from e-mail addresses matching those of a subscriber 
are accepted. If you often post from other addresses than the one 
you subscribe with, mail the list manager
<A HREF="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org">listmaster@lists.debian.org</A>
with the subject &quot;please add subscriber alias&quot;.</LI>
<LI>See section 
<A HREF="debian-faq-13.html#bugrpt">reporting bugs</A>
for notes on reporting bugs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="Searchtools"></A> <A NAME="ss12.4">12.4 Is there a quick way to search for information on Debian GNU/Linux?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
There are a variety of search engines that serve documentation related
to Debian. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://insite.verisim.com/search/debian/simple">Verism's search site</A>.  To obtain information on how to submit
a debian bug report, enter the words <CODE>debian bug submit</CODE>
and search for &quot;all of these words&quot;.

</LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com/forms/dnquery.html">DejaNews news search service</A>.  To find out what experiences people
have had with finding drivers for Western Digital controllers, try searching
on this phrase:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
linux & WD
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This tells DejaNews to report any postings containing both the 
string &quot;linux&quot; AND the string &quot;WD&quot;
When I used it, I discovered that my WD card (which I have only had for
6 months) has been declared outmoded by Adaptec, now that they have bought
WD. So there are no drivers available.  (Bless Adaptec's hearts.)
</LI>
<LI> The 
<A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/">AltaVista Search Engine</A> can also be used to search Usenet
(although it appears to be not quite as up to date as DejaNews).
For example, searching on the string "cgi-perl" gives a more detailed
explanation of this package than the brief description field in its
control file.
