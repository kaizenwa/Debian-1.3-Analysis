<H2><A NAME="WhatIsDebian"></A> <A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What is Debian GNU/Linux? </A>
</H2>

<P>Debian GNU/Linux is a particular <EM>distribution</EM> of the Linux operating
system, and numerous packages that run on it.  
In principle, users could obtain the Linux kernel via the Internet or 
from elsewhere,
and compile it themselves.  They could then obtain source code for many 
applications in the same way, compile the programs, then install them
into their systems.  For complicated programs, this process can be
not only time-consuming but error-prone.  To avoid it, users often
choose to obtain the operating system and the application
packages from one of the Linux distributors.   What distinguishes the
various Linux distributors are the software, protocols, and practices they
use for packaging, installing, and tracking applications packages on
users' systems, combined with installation and maintenance tools, 
documentation, and other services.  
<P>Debian GNU/Linux is the result of a volunteer effort to create a
free, high-quality Unix-compatible operating system, complete with
a suite of applications.  The idea of a free Unix-like system 
originates from the GNU project, and many of the applications that make 
Debian GNU/Linux so useful were developed by the GNU project.
<P>Debian was created by Ian Murdock in 1993, initially under the sponsorship
of the Free Software Foundation's GNU project.
Today, Debian's developers think of it as a direct descendent of 
the GNU project.
<P>Debian GNU/Linux is 
<UL>
<LI><B>full featured</B>:  Debian includes more than 900
software packages at present.  Users can select which packages to install; 
Debian provides a tool for this purpose.  You can find a list and descriptions 
of the packages currently available in Debian  at any of the 
Debian
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/ftplist.html">mirror sites</A>.
</LI>
<LI><B>free to use and redistribute</B>:  There is no consortium 
membership or
payment required to participate in its distribution and development.
All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free
to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General 
Public License.
The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 100 software 
packages (in the <CODE>non-free</CODE> and <CODE>contrib</CODE> directories at the FTP
archives), which are distributable under specific terms included with 
each package.
</LI>
<LI><B>dynamic</B>:  With about 160 volunteers constantly 
contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly.
New releases are planed to be made about every three months, and
the FTP archives are updated daily.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Though Debian itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added 
Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured 
base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, 
and allows Linux distribution creators to eliminate duplication-of-effort 
and focus on the things that make their distribution special.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="linux"></A> <A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 OK, now I know what Debian is...what is Linux!?</A>
</H2>

<P>In short, Linux is the kernel of a Unix-like operating system.  It was
originally designed for 386/486/Pentium PCs; now, ports to other systems, 
including multi-processor systems, are under development. Linux is written 
by Linus Torvalds and many computer scientists around the world.  
<P>Besides its kernel, a &quot;Linux&quot; system usually has:
<UL>
<LI>a file system that follows the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 
<A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</A>.</LI>
<LI>a wide range of Unix utilities, many of which have been
developed by the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The combination of the Linux kernel, the filesystem, the GNU and FSF 
utilities, and the other utilities are designed to achieve compliance with
the POSIX (IEEE 1003.1) standard;
see 
<A HREF="debian-faq-4.html#other Unices">source code compatibility</A>.
<P>For more information about Linux, see Michael K. Johnson's
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET">INFO-SHEET</A> and

<P>
<H2><A NAME="difference"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 What is the difference between Debian and other Linux distributions?</A>
</H2>

<P>Three key features distinguish Debian from other Linux distributions:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>The Debian package maintenance system:</B><DD><P>The entire system, or any individual component of it, can be upgraded in 
place without reformatting, without losing custom configuration files, and 
(in most cases) without rebooting the system.  Most Linux distributions
available today have some kind of package maintenance system; the 
<A HREF="debian-faq-6.html#pms">Debian package maintenance system</A>
is unique and particularly robust.  
<P>
<P>
<DT><B>Open development:</B><DD><P>Whereas other Linux distributions are developed by individuals, small,
closed groups, or commercial vendors, Debian is the only Linux
distribution that is being developed cooperatively by many individuals 
through the Internet, in the same spirit as Linux and other free software.  
More than 120 volunteer package maintainers are working on over 700 packages 
and improving Debian GNU/Linux.  The Debian developers 
contribute to the project
not by writing new applications (in most cases), but by
packaging existing software according to the standards of the project, 
by communicating bug reports to upstream developers, and by providing user
support.  See also additional information on 
<A HREF="debian-faq-14.html#contrib">how to become a contributor</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>The Bug Tracking System:</B><DD><P>The geographical dispersion of the Debian developers required sophisticated 
tools and quick communication of bugs and bug-fixes to accelerate the 
development of the system.  
Users are encouraged to send bugs in a formal style, which are quickly 
accessible by WWW archives or via e-mail.
See additional information in this FAQ on the management of the 
<A HREF="debian-faq-13.html#Bugs">Bug Log</A>.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="GNU"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 How does the Debian project fit in or compare with the Free Software Foundation's GNU project? </A>
</H2>

<P>The Debian system builds on the ideals of free software first
championed by the Free Software Foundation 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/">http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/</A> and in particular by Richard
Stallman.  FSF's powerful system development tools, utilities, and
applications are also a key part of the Debian system.
<P>The Debian Project is a separate entity from the FSF, however we
communicate regularly and cooperate on various projects. The FSF
explicitly requested that we call our system "Debian GNU/Linux", and
we are happy to comply with that request.
<P>The FSF's long-standing objective is to develop a new operating system
called GNU based on HURD (
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/software/hurd/hurd.html">http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/software/hurd/hurd.html</A>),
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="pronunciation"></A> <A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 How does one pronounce Debian and what does this word mean?</A>
        </H2>

<P>The project name is pronounced Deb'-ian, with a short e, and emphasis on 
the first syllable.  This word is a contraction of the names of Debra and
Ian Murdock, who founded the project.  (Dictionaries seem to offer some
ambiguity in the pronunciation of Ian (!), but Ian prefers ee'-an.)
