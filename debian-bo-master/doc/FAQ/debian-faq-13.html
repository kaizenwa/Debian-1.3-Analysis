<P>The Debian Linux distribution has a bug tracking system which files 
details of bugs reported by users and developers. Each bug is given a 
number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt with. 
<P>Copies of this information are available at 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">http://www.debian.org/Bugs/</A>.
<P>
<P>A mail server provides access to the bug tracking system database via
e-mail.  In order to get the instructions send an e-mail to
request@bugs.debian.org with "help" in the body.

</H2>

<P>If you have found a bug in Debian, please read the instructions for reporting
a bug in Debian.  These instructions can be obtained in one of several ways:
<UL>
<LI>By anonymous ftp.  Debian mirror sites contain the instructions in the
file <CODE>doc/bug-reporting.txt</CODE>.  </LI>
<LI>From the WWW.  A copy of the instructions is shown at
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting.html">http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting.html</A></LI>
<LI>On any Debian system with the <CODE>doc-debian</CODE> package installed.
The instructions are in the file <CODE>/usr/doc/debian/bug-reporting.txt</CODE>.  </LI>
</UL>
<P>Use these mail addresses for bugs:
<UL>
<LI>submit@bugs.debian.org:  for general bug reports.  Expect to
get an automatic acknowledgement of your bug report.  It will also be
automatically given a bug tracking number, entered into the bug log 
and forwarded to the debian-devel mailing list.</LI>
<LI>maintonly@bugs.debian.org:  to send bug reports to the maintainer
only. It will not be forwarded to the debian-devel mailing list.
For example, if one were to identify a bug that was common to many programs,
then rather than entering dozens of bug reports, one might prefer to
send individual bugs to maintonly, then send a summary report to 
debian-devel.</LI>
<LI>quiet@bugs.debian.org:  to submit bug reports to the bug log only, 
without having them sent either to debian-devel or to the maintainer.</LI>
</UL>
