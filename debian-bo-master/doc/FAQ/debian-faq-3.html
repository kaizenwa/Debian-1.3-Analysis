<H2><A NAME="Hardware"></A> <A NAME="s3">3. Hardware Requirements </A></H2>

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="architectures"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 On what architectures/systems does Debian GNU/Linux run?</A>
        </H2>

<P> 
Debian GNU/Linux includes complete source-code for
all of the included programs, so it should work on all systems which
are supported by the Linux Kernel; see the 
<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/iwj10/linux-faq/">Linux FAQ</A> for details.
<P>The current Debian GNU/Linux release contains a complete, binary
distribution for the i386 architecture; this covers PCs based on
Intel-compatible processors, including Intel's80386, 80486, Pentium,
and Pentium Pro, and compatible processors by AMD, Cyrix and others.
<P>The development of binary distributions of Debian 1.3 for the m68k
architecture (Motorola 680x0 processors for x>=2; with MMU) is
currently underway, and ports to Alpha, SPARC, and MIPS processors are
expected to follow.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="boot disks"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 What hardware is assumed by the stock Debian GNU/Linux boot disks?</A>
        </H2>

<P>The configuration file used to build Debian GNU/Linux'  
standard distribution kernel assumes an 80386 CPU, 
and includes support for PCMCIA cards  SCSI cards for which there 
exist Linux drivers. Support for network interface card is provided
by loadable modules, so there is no need to compile these drivers into
the kernel.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="disk space"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 What amount of disk space is recommended?</A>
        </H2>

<P>A generous installation, sufficient to accommodate a few users, X Window System
software, and several large applications, might require disk partitions
at least as large as:
<UL>
<LI>50 MBytes for the root directory (/)</LI>
<LI>500 MBytes for /usr</LI>
<LI>50 MBytes for swap space </LI>
<LI>50 MBytes for each home directories</LI>
<LI>100 MBytes for /tmp</LI>
<LI>100 MBytes for /var</LI>
</UL>
<P>The optimum disk space allocated for swap depends critically on the way the
system will be used.  Many people just choose to set aside twice as much
disk space as they have RAM space.  Systems with large RAM may not need so
much swap space, especially if there are only a few users.
The installation process supports systems with no swap space.
<P>
<H3>But how much RAM and disk space are absolutely essential?</H3>

<P>These <EM>minimal</EM> requirements are sufficient for a system without
X11 and only 1 or 2 users:
<UL>
<LI>15 MBytes of disk space for the <CODE>base</CODE> system; 
this provides a minimally-functioning Unix system, but includes 
no application programs and no network support.</LI>
<LI>100 MBytes of disk space for a standard system running applications 
on the console (i.e., without an X11 interface).</LI>
<LI>150 MBytes of disk space for a standard system running 
applications with the X Window System.</LI>
<LI>300 MBytes and more for all the optional programs (You probably 
do not need all of these programs.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>Debian Linux can be installed on systems with only 4 MBytes of RAM.
The latest installation disks are especially organized to provide an
easy installation path for machines with small memories.  
Some users report success at using Debian Linux to convert PCs 
having limited RAM (and disk space) into X terminals.  An
80386-based system with only 4 MBytes of RAM and 40 MBytes disk space
has been used to run Debian Linux in this way; i.e., both 
networking and basic X11 server functions operated satisfactorily.
This mode of operation even works if 1 MByte of the RAM is used as
a ramdisk when the machine is booted, implying that only 3 Mbytes of RAM
is absolutely essential for using Debian Linux on a PC in order to use it
as an X server.  This mode of operation requires a swap partition; without
it, the system will not even go into multi-user mode.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="partitioning"></A> <A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 How should I partition my drive?</A>
        </H2>

<P>Partitioning a drive has the disadvantage that drive space can be used
much less flexibly than an unpartitioned drive.  Most users find, however,
that this disadvantage is more than offset by the 
fact that damage to a filesystem on a partitioned disk is usually
limited to a single partition.
Furthermore, backups of a partitioned hard disk 
can be more easily managed because the files that change most 
frequently are likely to be localized to a single partition.
<P>A user with a 1.6 GByte drive has concluded after a survey of Debian users
that it is reasonable to design a partitioning scheme that closely follows the
<A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</A>.
For his 1.6 GByte disk, he chose these partitions: 
<UL>
<LI>30 MBytes for the root directory (<CODE>/</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>450 MBytes for <CODE>/usr</CODE></LI>
<LI>50 MBytes for swap space</LI>
<LI>1000 MBytes for home directories (some of this could be used for <CODE>/usr/local/</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>0 MBytes for <CODE>/tmp</CODE>; make <CODE>/tmp</CODE> 
a symbolic link to <CODE>/var/tmp</CODE></LI>
<LI>40 MBytes for <CODE>/var</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>It is possible to use a swap file instead of a swap
partition. However this usually is a bad solution, so we suggest to
use a swap partition.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="large disks"></A> <A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Are very large disks supported?</A>
        </H2>

<P>There is an upper limit on the size of the disk partition that is used for
booting.  This limit applies to all operating systems, not just Linux.
Basically, the BIOSs typically available 
on PCs cannot access disk partitions larger than 1024 cylinders or tracks.
Thus, <I>any</I> operating system used on a PC cannot be booted from 
a disk partition larger than 1 GByte.  It is worth emphasizing that
this restriction only applies to the partition from which Linux is booted.
Other partitions can be larger.  One solution to this limitation is
to place the directory <CODE>/boot/</CODE> (and usually the whole root partition) 
in its own (very small) partition,
entirely within the first 1024 blocks of the disk.
<P>Support for large non-bootable partitions varies with the driver.  
Detailed information is provided in the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/Large-Disk">Large-Disk mini-HOWTO</A>.
<P>The Linux kernel includes the Multi-Device disk
driver ('md'), which provides plain concatenation of drives (called
linear mode) or striping support (also known as RAID 0) in software.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="PCMCIA"></A> <A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 (How) Does Debian provide PCMCIA support?</A>
        </H2>

<P>Utilities that provide PCMCIA card services have been developed
by David Hinds.  These utilities are provided in Debian
by the package
<CODE>pcmcia-cs-KKK_VVV-RRR.deb</CODE>, where the components 'VVV'
and 'RRR' follow the usual conventions on 
<A HREF="debian-faq-6.html#pkgname">Debian package names</A>, and the component 'KKK' refers to the
kernel version for which the <CODE>pcmcia-cs</CODE> package was built.
<P>The <CODE>pcmcia-modules-KKK</CODE> package must be rebuilt for systems
not using the default Debian kernel.  The
<CODE>pcmcia-source_VVV-RRR.deb</CODE> package is provided for users
who need to recompile the PCMCIA modules or utilities.  It unpacks the
source files for the PCMCIA utilities into the
<CODE>/usr/src/modules/pcmcia-cs/</CODE> directory.  See the
<CODE>/usr/src/modules/pcmcia-cs/README.gz</CODE> file; it contains
instructions for rebuilding the PCMCIA packages.
<P>PCMCIA cards that include IDE drives have to be supported by the kernel.
The version of the kernel distributed with the Debian installation
disks includes support for such  PCMCIA cards.  That is, 
its <CODE>.config</CODE> file includes the line:
<CODE>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_PCMCIA=y</CODE>.
