<H2><A NAME="ss16.1">16.1 Increased security</A>
</H2>

<P>Debian now has Shadow password.
<P>In addition, the Linux library of Pluggable Authentication Modules 
(
<A HREF="http://parc.power.net/morgan/Linux-PAM/">http://parc.power.net/morgan/Linux-PAM/</A>; 
a.k.a. <CODE>libpam</CODE>) that allow sysadmins to choose authorization modes
on an application-specific basis will be available, and initially set to

</H2>

<P>Debian already has some 
<A HREF="debian-faq-5.html#nonEngl">support for non-English users</A>.
We hope to find people who provide support for even more languages.
<P>Some programs already support internationalization, so we need message 
catalogs. Many programs still must be internationalized.
<P>The GNU Translation Project 
<A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS</A> works on
internationalizing the GNU programs.

<H2><A NAME="ss16.3">16.3 More architectures</A>
</H2>

<P>Currently a complete Debian release is only available for the i386 
architecture. Complete Debian system on other architectures are expected soon.
