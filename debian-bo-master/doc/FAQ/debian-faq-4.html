<H2><A NAME="Compatibility"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Compatibility issues </A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="other distribs"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 How compatible is Debian with other distributions of Linux?</A>
        </H2>

<P>Debian developers communicate with other Linux distribution creators 
in an effort to maintain binary compatibility across Linux distributions. 
Most commercial Linux products run as well under Debian as they do on the
system upon which they were built. 
<P>
<P>Debian GNU/Linux adheres strictly to the 
<A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Linux File System Structure</A>
(now known as the FHS).  
However, there is room for interpretation in some of
the rules within this standard, so there may be differences between a 
Debian system and other Linux systems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="other Unices"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 How source code compatible is Debian with other Unix systems?</A>
        </H2>

<P>For most applications Linux source code is compatible
with other  Unix systems. It supports almost everything that
is available in System V Unix systems and the free and commercial BSD-
derived systems. However in the Unix business such claim has nearly no
value because there is no way to prove it. In the software
development area complete compatibility is required instead of
compatibility in &quot;about most&quot; cases. So years ago the need
for standards arose, and nowadays POSIX.1 (IEEE Standard 1003.1-1990)
is one of the major standards for source code compatibility in
Unix-like operating systems.
<P>Linux is intended to adhere to POSIX.1, but the POSIX standards cost
real money and the POSIX.1 (and FIPS 151-2) certification is quite
expensive; this made it more difficult for the Linux developers to
work on complete POSIX conformance. The certification costs make it
unlikely that Debian will get an official conformance certification
even if it completely passed the validation suite. (The
validation suite is now freely available, so it is expected that
more people will work on POSIX.1 issues.)
<P>
<P>
<P>Unifix GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany) developed a Linux system that has
been certified to conform to FIPS 151-2 (a superset of POSIX.1). This
technology is available in Unifix' own distribution called Unifix
Linux 2.0 and in Lasermoon's 
<A HREF="http://www.lasermoon.co.uk/linux-ft/linux-ft.html">Linux-FT</A>. Currently Unifix merges its patches into the Linux
kernel, gcc and other tools; so it is expected that their fixes
towards POSIX.1 conformance will be available in Debian (and other
distributions).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="other packages"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Can I use Debian packages (&quot;.deb&quot; files) on my RedHat/Slackware/... Linux system?</A>
Can I use RedHat packages (&quot;.rpm&quot; files) on my Debian GNU/Linux system?        </H2>

<P>Different Linux distributions use different package formats and different
package management programs.  
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>You probably can:</B><DD><P>A program to unpack a Debian package 
onto a Linux host that is been built from a `foreign' distribution
is available, and will generally work, in the sense that files will be
unpacked.  The converse is probably also true, that is, a program to
unpack a RedHat or Slackware package on a host that is based on Debian Linux
will probably succeed in unpacking the package and placing most files in
their intended directories.  This is largely a consequence of the existence
(and broad adherence to) the Linux File System Standard.
<P>
<DT><B>You probably do not want to:</B><DD><P>Most package managers write 
administrative files when they
are used to unpack an archive.  These administrative files are generally
not standardized.  Therefore, the effect of unpacking a Debian package
on a `foreign' host will have unpredictable (certainly not useful) effects 
on the package manager on that system.  Likewise, utilities from other 
distributions might succeed in unpacking their archives on Debian systems,
but will probably cause the Debian package management system to fail when the
time comes to upgrade or remove some packages, or even simply to report
exactly what packages are present on a system.
<P>
<DT><B>A better way:</B><DD><P>The Linux File System Standard (and therefore 
Debian GNU/Linux) requires that subdirectories under <CODE>/usr/local/</CODE> be 
entirely under the user's discretion.  Therefore, users can unpack 
`foreign' packages into this directory, and then manage their configuration, 
upgrade and removal individually.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="a.out"></A> <A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Is Debian able to run my old &quot;a.out&quot; programs?  </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<P>To <EM>execute</EM> a program whose binary is in <CODE>a.out</CODE>
(i.e., QMAGIC or ZMAGIC) format, 
<UL>
<LI>Make sure your kernel has <CODE>a.out</CODE>
support built into it, either directly (CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT=y) or as a 
module (CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT=m).  (Debian's kernel-image package contains 
the module <CODE>binfmt_aout</CODE>.)  
<P>If your kernel supports <CODE>a.out</CODE> binaries by a module, then be
sure that the <CODE>binfmt_aout</CODE> module is loaded.  You can do this
at boot time by entering the line <CODE>binfmt_aout</CODE> into the file
<CODE>/etc/modules</CODE>.  You can do it from the command line by 
executing the command <CODE>insmod DIRNAME/binfmt_aout.o</CODE> where 
<CODE>DIRNAME</CODE> is the name of the directory where the modules that
have been built for the version of the kernel now running are stored.
On a system with the 2.0.27 version of the kernel, 
<CODE>DIRNAME</CODE> is likely to be <CODE>/lib/modules/2.0.27/fs/</CODE>.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>install the package <CODE>libc4</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>If the program you want to execute is an <CODE>a.out</CODE> X client, then
install the <CODE>xcompat</CODE> package.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>If you have a commercial application in <CODE>a.out</CODE> format, now would 
be a good time to ask them to send you an <CODE>ELF</CODE> upgrade.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Can Debian be used to compile &quot;a.out&quot; programs? </A>
</H2>

<P>To <EM>compile</EM> programs in the <CODE>a.out</CODE> binary format,
<UL>
<LI>install the Debian <CODE>a.out</CODE> developer's packages, which are
<UL>
<LI><CODE>libc4-dev</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>aout-binutils</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>aout-librl</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>aout-gcc</CODE></LI>
</UL>

</LI>
<LI>place the <CODE>a.out</CODE> tools ahead of the <CODE>ELF</CODE>
tools in your path.  That is, execute the command
<CODE>export PATH=/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin:$PATH</CODE>
(This is not essential, just advantageous.)
If you are only going to do this once, you could execute:
<CODE>PATH=/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin:$PATH make [target]</CODE>.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="non-Debian programs"></A> <A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 How should I install a non-Debian package?</A>
        </H2>

<P>Files under the directory <CODE>/usr/local/</CODE> are not under the control
of the Debian package management system.  Therefore, it is good practice 
to place the source code for your program in /usr/local/src/.  For example,
you might extract the files for a package named &quot;foo.tar&quot;
into the directory <CODE>/usr/local/src/foo</CODE>.  After you compile them,
place the binaries in <CODE>/usr/local/bin/</CODE>, the libraries in
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/</CODE>, and the configuration files in
<CODE>/usr/local/etc/</CODE>.  
<P>If your programs and/or files really must be placed
in some other directory, you could still store them in <CODE>/usr/local/</CODE>,
and build the appropriate symbolic links from the required location 
to its location in <CODE>/usr/local/</CODE>, e.g., you could make the link
<PRE>
ln -s /usr/local/bin/foo /usr/bin/foo
</PRE>
<P>In any case, if you obtain a package whose copyright allows
redistribution, you should consider making a Debian package of it, and
uploading it for the Debian system.  Guidelines for becoming a package
developer are included in the 
<A HREF="debian-faq-12.html#DebianDocs">Debian policy manual</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="termcap"></A> <A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 Why can't I compile programs that require libtermcap?</A>
        </H2>

<P>Debian uses the <CODE>terminfo</CODE> database and the <CODE>ncurses</CODE> library
of terminal interface routes, rather than the <CODE>termcap</CODE> database
and the <CODE>termcap</CODE> library.  Users who are compiling programs that
require some knowledge of the terminal interface should replace references
to <CODE>libtermcap</CODE> with references to <CODE>libncurses</CODE>.
<P>To support binaries that have already been linked with the <CODE>termcap</CODE>
library, and for which you do not have the source,
Debian provides a package called <CODE>termcap-compat</CODE>.  This provides
both <CODE>libtermcap.so.2</CODE> and <CODE>/etc/termcap</CODE>.  Install this
package if the program fails to run with the error message 
&quot;can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'&quot;, or
complains about a missing <CODE>/etc/termcap</CODE> file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="AccelX"></A> <A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 Why can't I install AccelX?</A>
        </H2>

<P>AccelX uses the <CODE>termcap</CODE> library for installation. See 
<A HREF="#termcap">about termcap</A> above.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.9">4.9 Why do I get &quot;Can't find libX11.so.6&quot; errors when I try to run <CODE>foo</CODE>?</A>
</H2>

<P>This error message could mean that the program is in <CODE>a.out</CODE>
format. In this case you need to install the <CODE>xcompat</CODE>
package.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.10">4.10 Can I install and compile a kernel without some Debian-specific tweaking?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes.  But you have to understand the Debian policy with respect to headers.
<P>The Debian C libraries are built with the most recent <EM>stable</EM> 
releases of the <CODE>gcc</CODE> headers.  For example, the Debian-1.2 release
used version 5.4.13 of the headers.  This practice contrasts with the Linux 
kernel source packages distributed at all Linux FTP archive sites, 
which uses even more recent versions of the headers.  The kernel headers 
distributed with the kernel source are located in 
<CODE>/usr/include/linux/include/</CODE>.
<P>If you need to compile a program with kernel headers that are newer
than those provided by <CODE>libc5-dev</CODE>, then you must add 
<CODE>-I/usr/src/linux/include/</CODE> to your command line when compiling.
This came up at one point, for example, with the packaging of the 
automounter daemon (<CODE>amd</CODE>).  When new kernels changed some 
internals dealing with NFS, <CODE>amd</CODE> needed to know about them.  This
required the inclusion of the latest kernel headers.
