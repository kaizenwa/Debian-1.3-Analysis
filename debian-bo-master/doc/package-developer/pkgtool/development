Brian C. White <bcwhite@verisim.com> has formed a dpkg-development
group, `deity'

It is my pleasure to announce the formation of the dselect
replacement project, code-named "deity".  The project will be made
up of the following 7 people:


Project Leader:       Brian White <bcwhite@verisim.com>
 - General organization, dispute resolution, final say on
   "capabilities"


Chief Programmer:   Peter Iannarelli <peter@pisys.com>
 - Code organization, task breakdown, final say on "code"

Mechanic(*):      Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca>
 - Low-level class and library design

Dpkg Consultant:  Tom Lees <tom@lpsg.demon.co.uk>
 - Expert on compatibility with existing dpkg, dependency
   algorithms, etc.

Web Designer:     Mark Constable <markc@vv.com.au>
 - Work on HTML and CGI interfaces


Chief Designer:     Behan Webster <behanw@verisim.com>
 - Screen layout, ease of use, final say on "user interface"

Documentation:    Che Fox <che@imsa.edu>
 - high & low level design docs, idea tracking, user manuals


(*) Someone who likes to work on low-level "engines".  (I get called
this. :-)


A new list "deity@lists.debian.org" has been created with these
people subscribed to it.  I'm sure I speak for the whole team when I
say that we would like to hear everybody's ideas for this new tool.
As the design progresses, we will be presenting it back to the devel
& user lists for feedback.


About the people:

* Brian White has been working within the Debian project for about 2
  years now and is current the vice president of engineering.  He
  has 14 years of intense software development and knows C and C++
  very well.

* Peter Iannarelli is fairly new to Debian but is anxious to
  contribute.  He has 13 years of experience with Unix and C, plus 7
  years of C++.  He also has a background in java, motif, and
  curses, along with strong design and documentation skills.

* Jason Gunthorpe has 4 years of experience with C/C++ and enjoys
  working at the class-level of designs.  He has already started
  working out how some of the underlying problems can be solved
  efficiently.

* Tom Lees has experience with C/C++ and has spent time studying the
  existing dpkg system.  He also has a background in text-mode user
  interfaces and sgml documentation.

* Behan Webster has 14 years of experience with C programming and
  Unix, plus 5 years of C++.  He has worked extensively on user
  interfaces (mostly the graphical kind) and has a good feel for
  what is intuitive and easy to use.

* Che Fox is a whiz at linuxdoc-sgml and will be managing the
  documentation.  He also has experience with Tk interfaces.

* Mark Constable has a good background in web/cgi interaction and
  will be working to make that a viable interface.
