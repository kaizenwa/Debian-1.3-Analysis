Here is a list of the major specification changes from FSSTND 1.1 to
FSSTND 1.2.  Since this is a simplification, it's a good idea to check
out the standard document itself if one of these changes concerns you or
your software.

    * /bin: tcsh may be in /bin/tcsh or /usr/bin/tcsh.  (It was
    previously implied that /bin/tcsh was not compliant.)

    * /dev: the Linux device registrar is now H. Peter Anvin
    <Peter.Anvin@linux.org>, see the up-to-date device list at
    ftp.yggdrasil.com in /pub/device-list.

    * /etc: subdirectories of /etc/X11 for each window manager are no
    longer required.

    * /lib: /lib may contain miscellaneous shared libraries for binaries
    required in /bin or /sbin.  (As was the case before, but it's
    spelled-out now.)

    * /lib: /lib/modules is included, but not fully specified.

    * /sbin: `ctrlaltdel' is optional.

    * /usr: clarify that /usr/X386 is X11R5 on i386, /usr/X11R6 is X11R6
    on any Linux system.

    * /usr/include: /usr/include/g++ is now required.

    * /var/adm is obsolete.  lastlog is now in /var/log/lastlog.  wtmp
    is now in /var/log/utmp.  utmp is now in /var/run/utmp.
    Transitional symbolic links: /var/adm to /var/log, /var/log/utmp to
    /var/run/utmp.

    * /var/catman: /usr/man/cat[1-9] is for preformatted (i.e., on a
    CD-ROM) manual pages.  /var/catman remains a writable cache of
    formatted manual pages.

    * /var/named has been clarified, especially in relationship to
    /etc/named.boot.
