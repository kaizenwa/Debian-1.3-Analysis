               Accessing bug reports in the tracking system logs
                                       
   Each message received at or sent by the bug processing system is
   logged and made available in a number of ways.
   
   Copies of the logs are available on the World Wide Web at
   http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/iwj10/debian-bugs/ and
   http://www.debian.org/Bugs/ (_not up-to-date at present_).
   
   The HTML files containing the bug report logs are available in the
   WebPages subdirectory of the Debian FTP archive, and will be available
   on mirror sites that haven't explicitly removed them from their mirror
   configuration. A web server which is configured to serve this part of
   the FTP area as a webtree will provide a local copy of the pages.
   
   There is a mailserver which can send bug reports as plain text on
   request. To use it send the word help as the sole contents of an email
   to request@bugs.debian.org (the Subject of the message is ignored), or
   read the instructions on the World Wide Web or in the file
   bug-log-mailserver.txt.
