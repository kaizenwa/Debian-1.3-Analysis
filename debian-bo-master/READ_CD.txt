If your CD driver doesn't understand long file names, you might have some
trouble reading this CD. This might be the case for some DOS and Windows 3.1
users. The easiest thing to do in this case is to use the files in the
"bo\boot" directory to boot your system up to Linux, which will then be able
to read the CD. Windows 95 and NT seem to handle the long filenames fine as
well. If you want to find some files without first installing Linux, read the
"TRANS.TBL" file you will find in each directory. This is a map of the long
file names to the short DOS filenames you'll see on your disk.
